2024-03-30 09:17:37,Larry Fink is Not Your Friend,"The article argues that past financial policies, particularly bailouts of firms like BlackRock via Quantitative Easing (QE), will lead to future inflation. It posits that central banks now hold major portfolio losses from absorbing bad assets during these bailouts.

To cover these losses, the author predicts central banks will resort to ""more printing"" of money. This monetary expansion is expected to fuel ""more inflation,"" which will in turn cause lower standards of living, poverty, and crime. The piece suggests that the unwinding of excessive leverage in the Western financial system necessitates these actions. Gold is presented as a barometer of declining trust in this system and a hedge against the anticipated inflation resulting from these policies."

The author predicts the disaster will cause ""Things are going to cost more"" due to significant supply chain disruptions.

Baltimore is identified as the top US port for automobiles and a key hub for farm equipment, fertilizer, coal, and steel. The collapse will interrupt trucking links, affecting the transport of goods like fruits and vegetables to the mid-Atlantic and New England. This disruption is expected to create new price pressures, further straining an economy the author claims is already disintegrating despite official statistics."

US debt is reportedly rising by $1 trillion every three months, pushing the annual interest expense to a record $1.1 trillion.

This escalating fiscal burden is presented as a primary motivation for Fed Chair Powell to lower rates, a policy dubbed ""Interest Cost Control."" The implication is that future rate cuts may be driven by the need to manage government borrowing costs rather than by traditional inflation data like the CPI. Such a move, aimed at easing fiscal pressure, could risk stimulating the economy and allowing inflation to remain higher than the Fed's target, as it would represent an easing of monetary policy for reasons other than weak inflation."

2024-03-31 00:16:56,Weaponizing The Economy,"The article highlights multiple emerging inflationary pressures. The Baltimore bridge collapse threatens to disrupt supply chains, particularly for the auto sector, which was a key driver of 2023’s disinflation. This could impede further progress, as new car prices are already 20% above pre-pandemic levels. Historically, a rise in the NY Fed Global Supply Chain Pressure Index has preceded a year-over-year increase in US CPI by six months.

Geopolitical tensions are also stoking inflation. Oil prices have hit a four-month high due to attacks on Russian refineries and sanctions disrupting trade. The article warns of the potential ""weaponization of oil,"" drawing parallels to the 1973 embargo that saw inflation soar to 12%. This, combined with rising prices for other commodities like cocoa and uranium, creates a challenging outlook, suggesting a potential reversal of recent disinflationary trends and risking a 1970s-style stagflation."

2024-03-31 08:10:00,Globalists Claim Mass Immigration Helps The US Economy – Here's Why That's A Lie,"The article argues that mass immigration contributes to US inflation, particularly through housing. It claims an ""oppressive spike"" in home and rent costs, which have doubled in some areas, is partly caused by millions of migrants increasing housing demand. The author asserts that reducing illegal immigration would cause rents to fall quickly.

The text also references the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive. This is presented as the actual reason for any deficit reduction, countering claims of economic benefits from immigration. The author notes that while the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects immigration will boost GDP, the same report forecasts unemployment will increase in 2024. The article suggests government spending on migrants artificially boosts GDP figures while straining the real economy."

2024-03-31 19:17:07,Bazooka Xi: Why Gold and Stocks Both Rally Now,"The article suggests recent surges in gold and commodity prices are not driven by US policy. It notes there is ""no data suggesting the Fed would ease,"" implying US inflation remains a key concern for the central bank. Instead, the rally is attributed to market anticipation of a major economic stimulus from China, similar to Quantitative Easing (QE).

This potential Chinese policy involves injecting massive liquidity into the economy, which is already causing a ""general spike across all commodity prices,"" including oil. This global price pressure, driven by foreign stimulus, could create new inflationary challenges for the US. Rising commodity costs could translate into higher consumer prices, complicating the Federal Reserve's efforts to manage domestic inflation even as it maintains a tight monetary stance."

This lower-than-anticipated inflation reading, combined with a recent dovish press conference by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, is presented as a significant factor fueling the stock market rally. The data suggests a potential easing of price pressures, which supports market expectations for a less aggressive monetary policy from the Fed. This outlook is seen as a catalyst for pushing the S&P 500 to new highs."

Analysts cited soaring inflation, approaching nearly 70%, as a decisive factor in the ruling party's historic defeat. This economic strain, alongside the highest borrowing costs in over two decades resulting from an aggressive monetary-tightening regime, created a cost-of-living crisis that punished the government at the polls. President Erdogan acknowledged the economic discontent, calling the outcome a ""turning point."" He predicted the positive effects of his economic plan would materialize in the second half of the year, indicating a hope that current policies will eventually control inflation."

2024-04-01 05:00:00,"More Inflation, More Copper Theft","High US inflation is creating significant economic distress, evidenced by a surge in copper theft from critical infrastructure. While a World Bank report forecasted declining metal prices for 2024, citing factors like a 52% coal price reduction in 2023, persistent dollar inflation may negate these predictions.

If US inflation continues unabated, the relative price of copper is expected to keep rising. This trend is exacerbated by supply chain disruptions, such as the Port of Baltimore closure, which add upward pressure on energy prices in an already-inflationary environment. The widespread theft is considered a direct indicator of the US dollar's declining purchasing power and broader economic instability, with copper futures trending upward in early 2024."

2024-04-01 06:30:00,No Fooling: Gov. Newsom's $20 Minimum Wage Hits April 1,"The article discusses the inflationary impact of California's new $20 minimum wage for fast-food workers. In response to rising labor costs, businesses are increasing prices. One restaurant owner reported raising prices by around 10% to stay solvent.

This wage policy is expected to create further upward pressure on fast-food prices. The author suggests that if general inflation continues or worsens, it will compound these price hikes, potentially leading to reduced customer demand and subsequent layoffs. The piece also notes the impact of higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve on California's state budget, linking the local wage policy to the broader national economic context of fighting inflation. The wage increase is framed as a direct contributor to localized price inflation."

2024-04-01 07:20:00,"Spending, Income, And Inflation Data Do Not Support Fed Interest Rate Cuts","Based on the February 2024 Personal Income and Outlays report, US inflation remains significantly above the Federal Reserve's 2.0% target, weakening the case for immediate interest rate cuts. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.3% month-over-month. More precisely, the increase was 0.333%, which annualizes to nearly 4.0%.

This inflationary pressure is also seen in spending data, where nominal spending rose 0.8% against a 0.4% increase in real spending. Further signs of inflation include rising rent prices for the second consecutive month and record-high home prices. Despite this data suggesting persistent inflation, market expectations, guided by Fed commentary, still anticipate a potential rate cut in June."
2024-04-01 08:30:16,Are You Ready For the Second Wave of Inflation?,"The article argues the Federal Reserve’s politically motivated policies are creating significant inflationary risks. It claims the Fed is promising to cut interest rates to boost the economy for the current administration, despite inflation remaining above the 2% target.

This approach is reportedly fueling asset bubbles, evidenced by the S&P National Home Price Index rising 6% in January, up from 5.6% in December. The author notes that when home prices last rose this quickly, overall inflation was also around 6%. The central forecast is that the Fed's actions are ""unleashing a second wave of inflation,"" with the recent surge in gold prices to all-time highs presented as a key indicator of this impending risk."

2024-04-01 17:19:40,How We Can Fix Our Money,"The article posits that the current monetary system is being deliberately inflated to worthlessness, prompting nations like the BRICS to seek alternatives to the US dollar. It introduces the ""A + B Theorem,"" arguing a structural gap exists between consumer purchasing power (wages, dividends) and the total price of goods. This gap is filled by debt-based money creation, which the author identifies as the fundamental cause of inflation and economic instability.

The proposed solution is a ""Social Credit"" system featuring a national dividend and a compensated price. To prevent this new money from causing inflation, its issuance would be dynamically adjusted via a ""Just Price mechanism"" based on the economy's real production levels. This aims to precisely match purchasing power with available goods and services, thereby eliminating inflation."

2024-04-02 07:20:00,"The Senate Calls Out-Of-Control Spending A National Security Threat, Keeps Spending Anyway...","The article argues that the growing US national debt, now exceeding $34 trillion, creates significant inflationary pressure. It posits that large government spending, such as a recent $1.2 trillion bill, forces the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low to manage the cost of debt. This need for low rates is expected to ""erode the dollar’s purchasing power,"" subjecting Americans to an ""inflation tax.""

The author notes that recent Fed rate increases have already caused national debt payments to rise by 32% in the last year, highlighting the fiscal strain of tighter monetary policy. The article concludes that this cycle of debt and artificially low rates will ultimately devalue the dollar, potentially causing it to lose its world reserve currency status and triggering a major economic crisis."

This persistence has directly impacted monetary policy expectations, causing the probability of an interest rate cut at the June Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting to fall below 50%.

Typically, sticky inflation and the resulting prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates would be considered headwinds for gold. However, the author points out that gold has atypically rallied to an all-time high despite these factors. This counterintuitive market behaviour is highlighted as part of a broader mystery surrounding the asset's recent price surge, which defies traditional economic indicators and expectations."

According to a Gallup poll, individuals aged 18-29 are more than twice as likely as older adults to name the economy as their primary concern.

The piece asserts that ""elevated inflation is crushing household finances"" and warns of mounting risks that inflation could accelerate again. Rising gas prices are noted as a current example of this trend. This economic pessimism, fueled by inflation, is reportedly causing a significant political shift among young voters who are struggling financially. The article suggests these frustrations stem from the failure of 'Bidenomics', making it difficult for young people to afford basic expenses and housing."

Consequently, he anticipates the Federal Reserve will enact fewer interest rate cuts than the market currently expects.

Einhorn predicts fewer than the three cuts priced in for the year, suggesting there is a chance the Fed may not cut rates at all. He attributes the underlying risk to “systemically too loose” monetary and fiscal policies, viewing the national deficits as a significant, unsustainable problem. This macroeconomic outlook informs his large position in gold, which he holds as a hedge against potential negative outcomes for the US economy."

2024-04-04 07:20:00,Gold's Defiance Of Real Yields Can't Last Unless Trouble Brewing,"The article analyzes gold's record price through its relationship with inflation and interest rates. Currently, the 10-year real yield is elevated at around 2%, a level that typically weakens gold prices. This contrasts with historical precedents, such as the 1980 gold peak when 10-year nominal yields were well below the inflation rate, resulting in negative real yields. The discussion of real yields and TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) highlights the market's inflation expectations. The current anomaly, with gold rallying despite high real yields, suggests investors may be more concerned about a potential future economic crisis than reacting to current inflation trends."

2024-04-04 13:54:37,Gold Is on the Rise and Reaches All-Time High,"The article notes that US inflation, while “bumpy,” continues to track lower. This trend of moderating inflation is a key factor supporting the Federal Reserve's outlook for three interest rate cuts in 2024. This environment, combined with a soft landing scenario and accommodative central bank policies, has helped fuel a broad market rally.

Globally, central banks are reportedly buying gold as a strategic hedge against inflation and the effects of relaxed monetary policy. Furthermore, the prospect of a synchronized global easing cycle is expected to benefit the “reflation trade,” boosting commodities. This suggests growing expectations for a controlled rise in prices and economic activity, as recession forecasts have dissipated. The overall sentiment points towards managed inflation supporting looser monetary policy and asset price growth."

While he views the Fed's current policy as ""about right,"" he foresees a difficult choice within the year: either permit a recession or resume QE, which would ""re-flame inflation.""

Hoenig predicts the US dollar's purchasing power will continue to decline due to undisciplined money creation and runaway fiscal policy. He believes this inflationary trend will persist until a monetary discipline is restored, warning that current policies are unsustainable and will lead to a continued fall in the dollar's value."

It highlights Federal Reserve Chair Powell's perspective on the labor market's link to inflation. Powell suggested that strong jobs growth might not necessarily fuel inflation due to an expanding labor supply. This view downplays the risk of an overheating economy from robust employment figures.

Conversely, Powell noted that an ""unexpected deterioration"" in the labor market could prompt the Fed to consider interest rate cuts sooner. The jobs report is therefore positioned as a crucial signal for the Fed's future policy decisions regarding inflation, serving as an ""appetizer"" to the more direct CPI data."

2024-04-05 11:54:57,"Gold Jumps to New ATH of $2,324 at this Writing","The article posits that the risk of US inflation reaccelerating is real. This is attributed to an ""Anti-Goldilocks"" environment where rising corporate profits may encourage unions to seek pay raises and consumers seem willing to accept higher prices.

However, the author notes that the inflationary side of stagflation is currently being kept ""at bay."" Unlike the 1970s, today’s weaker unions and immigration are helping to suppress labor costs. The piece suggests that fiscal policy, driven by government spending and job creation, now has a greater influence on the economy than the Federal Reserve. While these factors are currently containing price pressures, the underlying risk of inflation remains a significant concern for the near future."
2024-04-05 12:05:00,Behind Today's Stellar Jobs Print: It Was Literally ALL Part-Time Jobs (And Illegals),"The article argues that recent US job market trends, particularly a surge in immigrant labor, are directly impacting inflation. It cites Fed Chair Powell, who stated that immigration has been ""critical in keep[ing] wages lower,"" helping to bring the labor market into better balance and easing wage-driven inflationary pressures. The author contends this dynamic is masking underlying economic weaknesses. The piece concludes by forecasting that if the influx of immigrant workers were to be halted, the US would face a ""stagflationary recession."" This would reveal a truer, more severe picture of the underlying inflation and economic challenges currently being suppressed by the expanded labor supply."

By forcing a shift to EVs, the policy is expected to reduce the supply of traditional gas-powered cars, causing their prices to escalate as demand outstrips the limited supply. This could make new vehicles unaffordable for many consumers.

Furthermore, the article highlights ""socialized costs"" associated with the EV transition. These costs, from subsidies and required grid upgrades, are expected to be passed on to the public through taxes and higher electricity bills. A cited report from the Texas Public Policy Foundation estimates that without government support, the average EV would cost $48,698 more over 10 years, indicating a significant cost-shift to taxpayers and utility customers."

The author asserts that many Americans struggle to afford groceries and points to ""shrinkflation"" as a significant issue. The piece contrasts the current situation with a recent past allegedly characterized by ""low prices, low inflation, [and] low mortgage interest rates."" It frames the upcoming election as a choice between the current economic hardships and a potential return to a more stable economy with lower inflation under a different leader. The article presents a desire for a return to an era of greater prosperity and affordability for normal citizens."
2024-04-05 23:40:00,World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here's Why It Can't Be Avoided,"The article argues that escalating geopolitical conflicts are a primary threat to US inflation stability. It posits that the Biden administration has artificially suppressed the Consumer Price Index (CPI) by using strategic oil reserves to lower energy prices. This strategy is now at risk.

Recent attacks on Russian oil infrastructure have already caused gas price spikes. The author forecasts that a wider Middle East war involving Iran could be disastrous. A potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, which handles 30% of the world’s oil traffic, would cause energy prices to ""explode."" This inflation surge is presented as a major political risk for the current administration, which may seek to delay an economic calamity or use a larger war as a scapegoat."

The European Central Bank (ECB) has acknowledged these threats. Its March meeting accounts highlight that rising energy and freight costs could push inflation higher and feed through to all price components. This uncertainty supports a cautious approach to future interest rate cuts, even as a June move is anticipated. While the article focuses on the Eurozone, these global energy price pressures are a key factor for inflation worldwide. The text does not contain specific data or forecasts for US inflation."
2024-04-06 15:45:00,Arabica Coffee Prices See Largest Weekly Jump In Nearly Three Years,"Global food inflation is re-accelerating, posing a challenge for central banks. Key commodity prices are surging, with Arabica coffee futures hitting a 1.5-year high. Coffee prices jumped 12.5% in one week to $2.12 per pound, driven by production concerns. Forecasts place Arabica between $1.88 and $2.15 for 2024.

This follows ""hyperinflating"" cocoa prices. Additionally, a recent surge in Brent crude oil is expected to further lift global food prices. The article concludes that persistent food inflation is problematic for central banks, suggesting potential difficulties in controlling overall inflation and managing interest rates."
2024-04-06 16:26:09,Why Central Banks Want the Gold,"The article suggests the rising price of gold is an indicator of the US dollar's declining international purchasing power, a form of inflation. This trend is not linked to traditional economic correlations but to a geopolitical shift where nations increasingly need physical gold for international trade. This need was reportedly triggered by the US confiscation of Russian assets, which eroded global trust in the dollar system.

Consequently, gold's value is rising against all currencies. The author argues that even with a stable dollar index, gold's rise reflects the dollar's diminishing buying power abroad. While interest rates may alter the speed of this trend, they are not expected to change its fundamental direction, signalling a continued decline in the dollar's international value."

While the author disputes the validity of the labor data, the ""strong"" report is seen as a key factor influencing monetary policy.

A historical parallel is drawn to the 1980-1982 period, when peak interest rates lagged peak inflation by a year, implying the current fight against inflation could be prolonged. The summary also highlights a significant future risk: a potential ""global oil shock"" stemming from Middle East instability, which would create new inflationary pressures. This contributes to a forecast of ""maximum uncertainty"" for the economy."

In France, a ""Gilets Jaunes"" inflation index, tracking essential costs like energy, food, and housing, has outpaced average wage growth since the pandemic, eroding living standards.

The piece argues that wars historically cause inflation to skyrocket as governments print money, a path Europe may be on. This risk is recognized by major institutions; UBS's 2023 report lists inflation as a ""top and emerging risk,"" and insurance companies are raising prices due to inflation-driven costs. In response to stagflation, the European Central Bank (ECB) is signaling a dovish turn, with an expected interest rate cut in June. The article contains no specific data on current US inflation rates."
2024-04-06 23:20:00,America Is Hurtling Toward A Full-Blown Hot Civil War,"The article attributes current economic hardship to flawed monetary theory and excessive government spending, citing a national debt approaching $35 trillion. It argues that the belief in limitless money printing is failing, leading to tangible consequences for citizens. These include struggles to afford basic necessities like food and rent.

Additionally, high mortgage rates are placing home ownership out of reach for the younger generation. The author views these economic pressures as a direct result of government policies that have eroded the middle class and are destroying the nation's economy, driven by ""out-of-control spending and massive national debt."""

At the start of the year, the market was pricing in 125 basis points of cuts. However, expectations have since shifted dramatically, with 2-3 rate cuts now being ""priced out."" This reversal implies that inflation is not cooling as quickly as anticipated, reducing the likelihood of the Federal Reserve easing monetary policy in the near term.

Despite this more hawkish outlook on interest rates, which is directly influenced by the inflation picture, stock markets have continued to perform strongly, creating an interesting divergence."

This was facilitated by the Federal Reserve creating an “Everything Bubble” by holding interest rates near zero for 15 years. This policy, combined with government spending that adds $1 trillion to the national debt every 100 days, is driving annual interest costs toward a projected $1.6 trillion by the end of 2024.

However, the author’s primary forecast is not for continued inflation but for a subsequent “Great Deflation.” This deflationary depression is expected to follow the bubble's collapse, trapping those in debt and allowing for a mass seizure of assets.

US year-over-year inflation, measured by personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was 2.5% in February. This has caused traders to slightly reduce expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

Despite this, the market anticipates the Fed will still cut rates, interpreting it as a willingness to accommodate higher inflation. This view is supported by a recent surge in commodity prices, which may indicate future inflation. Notably, crude oil has increased by 10% and US wholesale gasoline prices have spiked by approximately 30% in the past two months. The article also notes that inflation is a top economic concern for American voters."

Despite outright shorts on Treasuries being near 20-year lows, the author argues that upside inflation risks are being underestimated by the market.

A key concern is the growing gap between rising inflation uncertainty and falling bond volatility. Historically, increased inflation uncertainty leads to more volatile and higher yields. The analysis suggests this gap is likely to close through rising bond volatility. Given the current inflation backdrop, bond yields are poised to remain elevated, indicating that current market positioning may be misjudging future inflation pressures."

He points to several inflationary forces: large government deficits, global remilitarization, supply chain restructuring, and green economy spending. These factors may lead to ""stickier inflation"" and higher rates than markets expect.

Dimon remains cautious due to quantitative tightening draining over $900 billion from the system annually. Consequently, his firm is prepared for a wide range of interest rates, from 2% to 8% or even higher. He warns the worst-case scenario is stagflation, where a recession combines with high inflation, and cautions against over-focusing on monthly data as long-term trends may already be set."

While the pace of consumer price increases is expected to ease, forecasts predict annual headline inflation will remain above 3%. Rising oil and commodity prices, coupled with supply disruptions, are threatening the disinflationary trend in goods.

Market indicators reflect these concerns. Two-year breakeven rates have climbed, with TIPS now pricing in average inflation of around 2.85% over the next two years. This persistent inflation casts doubt on the Fed's ability to deliver its projected six interest rate cuts by the end of 2025."
2024-04-09 07:45:00,US Small-Business Optimism Slides To 11-Year Low As Bidenomics Fails,"US small business confidence has plunged to its lowest level since 2012, driven primarily by persistent inflation concerns. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) optimism index fell to 88.5.

Inflation was named the single most important problem by 25% of business owners, a 2-point increase from the previous month. This concern is materializing in pricing decisions, as the proportion of firms raising their average selling prices jumped by 7 points. The souring sentiment is directly linked to rising consumer and gasoline prices observed early in the year. These inflationary pressures, coupled with the weakest hiring plans since May 2020, signal significant economic headwinds and uncertainty for the US economy."
2024-04-09 08:10:54,Futures Flat In Cautious Trade Ahead Of CPI As Gold Roars To New Record High,"Market sentiment is cautious ahead of a crucial US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which will heavily influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. While economists forecast some cooling, the core CPI is expected to remain elevated at 3.7% year-over-year, well above the Fed's 2% target.

However, risks of a higher-than-expected reading persist, fueled by rising commodity prices. Reflecting these concerns, the 5-year US inflation swap reached 2.57%, its highest since October. The New York Fed’s survey showed mixed consumer expectations, with the 1-year outlook steady at 3.0% and the 3-year measure rising to 2.9%. Growing inflation fears are diminishing market bets on the number of Fed rate cuts for 2024, with investors now favouring just two reductions."
2024-04-09 08:25:00,"In The Next Several Weeks, We Could See $300 Billion Of Liquidity Leaving The System","The article highlights emerging inflationary pressures driven by geopolitical risks. Brent crude oil has surged nearly 30% since December, putting significant upward pressure on bond yields. This concern is reflected in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, which has climbed from 3.78% to 4.40% over the same period. While the article’s main focus is on a potential market liquidity contraction—driven by tax payments, quantitative tightening ($95 billion/month), and the expiry of bank lending facilities—the rise in energy prices and bond yields are presented as key encroaching risks. These factors suggest growing concerns about inflation in the near future."

This move reflects broader economic strain, as seen with the recent liquidation of all 99 Cents Only stores, which cited ""persistent inflationary pressures"" as a key factor. Similarly, Dollar Tree is closing nearly 1,000 Family Dollar locations, with inflation being a contributing cause. The article suggests these developments are a symptom of a struggling economy, noting that Dollar Tree's fastest-growing demographic is consumers earning around $125,000. These changes highlight how inflationary pressures are reshaping the retail landscape and consumer costs."

The article links this trend to a significant rise in gold prices, which have increased over 13% year-to-date.

A key driver for this surge is cited as ""persistent inflation,"" alongside concerns over the nearly $35 trillion US national debt and a deteriorating fiscal situation. This suggests investors and consumers are increasingly turning to gold as a hedge to protect their wealth against inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty. The high sales volume underscores the public's reaction to the current inflationary environment, viewing the precious metal as a reasonable hedge for diversified portfolios."

2024-04-10 07:21:54,Renewed Inflation Risks Aren't Scaring Buyers Yet,"Soaring commodity prices have renewed concerns about US inflation, causing market nervousness ahead of the upcoming CPI data. Strategists acknowledge that a strong labor market and higher commodity prices make it harder for inflation to slow, but they do not expect the disinflation process to be derailed.

Inflation expectations in the US and Europe are strengthening, evidenced by rising breakevens and swap rates. This has prompted caution, with investors increasing demand for hedges and selling $9.4 billion in S&P 500 long positions last week. Despite these worries, some analysts believe the improving growth outlook will outweigh inflation fears, especially as the market still anticipates interest rate cuts this year. A cooler CPI print would be a significant boon for risk assets."
2024-04-10 07:32:31,"CPI Preview: The First ""Miss"" Of 2024?","The upcoming March CPI report is a critical event for US markets and Federal Reserve policy. Market sentiment indicates that an inline or lower inflation reading could fuel a continued rally. However, a high CPI print would be the third consecutive hot report, likely triggering a significant sell-off.

Such a result would challenge the Fed's narrative for a June interest rate cut. With core CPI already hotter than expected for three straight months, another high reading could push any potential rate cuts beyond 2024, partly due to political sensitivities around the November election. This delay in monetary easing could precipitate a collapse in risk assets, as expectations for Fed support diminish."

There are no references to inflation rates, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), interest rates, or any economic indicators detailing price changes.

A hotter-than-expected reading, particularly a core CPI print above 0.4%, could challenge the prospect of a summer rate cut, potentially pushing it to September. Atlanta Fed President Bostic reiterated his expectation for only one cut this year. Despite this caution, investor sentiment ahead of the report saw the probability of a June rate cut rise to 60%. A surprise to the upside could trigger a significant market reaction, with some analysts predicting a 2% drop in stocks."
2024-04-10 08:15:00,Inflation Has Become A Bigger Risk For Stretched Gold Prices,"The article analyses US inflation's impact on real interest rates and gold prices. The real fed funds rate, calculated using CPI, is currently 2.3%. This is outside the historical -2% to +2% ""sweet spot"" that has recently driven gold's strong performance.

Consequently, gold has become more sensitive to inflation data. A softer-than-expected CPI reading would push real rates higher, potentially triggering a selloff in the metal. While a single weak inflation print is possible, the author notes that the overall bias for inflation remains higher in the medium term. This suggests that real yields are unlikely to deviate significantly from their optimal range for long, potentially limiting the duration of any gold price dips."
2024-04-10 21:20:00,"Inflation Check: Doctors Making $350,000 Per Year Can't Find Homes In Long Island As Prices Surge 50%","This article challenges the narrative that US inflation is under control, using soaring housing prices as a key counter-indicator. Despite official reports of cooling inflation, the author points to a housing crisis in New York as evidence of persistent price pressures.

In Long Island, home prices have surged by 50% to nearly $1 million, with available listings plummeting by 60%. This trend is mirrored in upstate areas and exacerbated by mortgage rates nearing 7%. The piece argues that such significant and sustained price increases in the housing sector, a critical component of the economy, directly contradict the idea that the Federal Reserve has successfully tamed inflation. These rising costs demonstrate that significant inflationary pressures remain, questioning the effectiveness of current monetary policy."

2024-04-10 22:40:00,Huge Dovish Bet Loses $50 Million In One Day,"A stronger-than-expected US inflation report caused a significant market shift, defying bets on a dovish outcome. The March Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in ""hot on every possible metric,"" leading to a market rout and a reported $50 million loss for one trader who bet on lower inflation.

Following the surprisingly strong inflation data, market expectations for Federal Reserve policy were drastically revised. The forecast for Fed rate cuts in 2024 fell from approximately 65 basis points to less than two 25-basis-point moves for the entire year. The timeline for the first potential quarter-point cut was pushed back from September to November. Similarly, expectations for a significant June rate cut collapsed, with swaps pricing in only 3 basis points of easing for that meeting."

This persistent inflation could postpone the first anticipated interest rate cut until the second half of the year or later.

Consequently, market expectations have shifted dramatically. Interest rate swaps now price in fewer than two rate cuts for the year, a significant drop from the seven cuts expected in early January. This ""higher for longer"" interest rate environment, a direct response to stubborn inflation, is hammering demand for rate-sensitive assets like luxury goods. A delayed recovery in these markets is now expected as borrowing costs remain elevated due to the ongoing inflation concerns."

2024-04-11 06:30:00,Von Greyerz: Gold & Silver Are Entering Their Exponential Phase,"The article argues that the rising price of gold is a direct result of long-term US dollar inflation and currency debasement. It states the dollar has lost 98.5% of its purchasing power against gold since 1971.

The author contends that official inflation figures are artificially low due to changes in calculation methods made in the 1980s. Using the official Consumer Price Index (CPI), the 1980 gold peak of $850 would be $3,590 today. However, using an alternative ""REAL inflation"" metric, that same peak would be equivalent to $29,200. Similarly, silver's 1980 high of $50 would be $166 adjusted for CPI, but $1,350 using ""REAL inflation."" The piece posits that precious metals are undervalued relative to historical inflation and their prices will rise as currency debasement continues."
2024-04-11 06:55:00,"Russia Bombards Ukraine With Hypersonic Missiles & Drones, Damaging Power Plants, NatGas Facilities","Geopolitical tensions, including Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and OPEC+ supply cuts, are pushing energy prices higher. This is evidenced by a nearly 7% surge in European natural gas futures and forecasts of Brent crude oil possibly returning to $100 per barrel.

These rising energy costs are directly contributing to a reacceleration of US inflation. This development complicates the Federal Reserve's planned policy pivot, making potential interest rate cuts more difficult. The persistence of higher inflation, driven by energy prices, is presented as a significant economic and political challenge ahead of the November presidential election."

2024-04-11 07:48:13,ECB Preview: No Surprises Today With All Eyes On June,"The article focuses on Euro Area inflation ahead of an ECB meeting. Recent data shows mixed progress. Headline inflation in the Eurozone fell to 2.4% in March, with supercore inflation dropping below 3% for the first time in two years. However, services inflation remains elevated at 4%.

The ECB's March projections lowered 2024 and 2025 inflation forecasts, with the latter now matching the bank's 2% target. Consumer inflation expectations for one year ahead have also eased to 3.1%.

This progress has led policymakers to guide markets towards a first interest rate cut in June, with the deposit rate currently at 4.0%. While the ECB emphasizes its independence from the US Fed, the focus remains on Euro Area data justifying a shift in its restrictive monetary policy."
2024-04-11 11:53:07,Is Someone Cornering The Gold Market Using Options?,"Recent strong US inflation data, with the US CPI report ""coming in hot,"" has impacted financial markets. This higher-than-expected inflation prompted a rally in the US dollar and 10-year Treasury yields.

Consequently, the data has cast significant doubt on the possibility of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in June. The article frames this inflation news as a major economic headwind. While the primary focus is on gold's unusual reaction, the core economic point is that persistent inflation is actively shaping expectations for US monetary policy and creating challenging market conditions."
2024-04-11 13:29:00,Israeli Media Says Iran Postponed Attack 'At Last Minute' Due To Threat Of US Intervention,"Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, particularly the threat of an Iranian strike, are hanging over inflation-focused oil markets. Despite the risk, oil markets have seen a muted response, with Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trading down over 1%.

This market behavior is attributed to broader US inflation concerns. These persistent concerns have led to speculation that the Federal Reserve may not implement its anticipated June interest rate cut. The potential for regional conflict adds a significant layer of uncertainty to an economic outlook already shaped by inflation and shifting monetary policy expectations."

What is it exactly?,"US inflation accelerated in March, with Core CPI showing its worst increase in a year and overall CPI hitting its highest level since November 2022. This resurgence is attributed to persistent inflation in core services, which offset slight declines in durable goods prices.

The new data has significantly altered monetary policy expectations, dashing the Federal Reserve's hopes for substantial interest rate cuts. Consequently, investors have revised their forecasts, now anticipating only two rate cuts this year, a sharp decrease from the six expected at the beginning of the year. Despite the stubbornly high inflation report, President Biden maintained his prediction that the Fed would cut rates before the end of the year."
2024-04-11 20:50:00,That '70s Trade: How Goldman Is Preparing For The Coming 2nd Inflationary Tsunami,"The article discusses US inflation, noting that Fed Chair Powell has raised interest rates to 40-year highs to combat the recent inflationary breakout. This action aims to avoid repeating the mistakes of the 1970s, when premature policy easing sparked a second, more severe inflation wave that pushed interest rates as high as 15%.

Despite the Fed's efforts, the market is reportedly forecasting a failure. A new Goldman Sachs stock basket (GSXU1970) has been introduced for traders to invest in companies that would benefit from a return of 1970s-style inflation. This market indicator suggests that traders are now actively positioning for a second, far more dangerous wave of inflation to be unleashed, signalling a loss of confidence in the Fed's ability to control rising prices long-term."

2024-04-11 21:56:03,"GODL! Precious Metal Soars Above $2,400 After Sudden Gap Higher","The article interprets the recent surge in gold prices as a significant indicator of future US inflation risks. Underlying this concern is unsustainable fiscal policy, with the US issuing $1 trillion in debt every 100 days. Interest on this debt is projected to become the largest government expense.

Analysts suggest investors are hedging against the risk that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates even if CPI accelerates. This potential pivot towards policies like Quantitative Easing (QE) or Yield Curve Control (YCC) to manage government debt is viewed as highly inflationary. The gold rally, with some forecasts reaching $3,000/oz by 2025, is therefore seen as a market warning, pricing in significant currency debasement and a future inflationary environment despite currently high interest rates."
2024-04-11 22:30:00,"In Latest Humiliation For Biden Admin, Russian Oil Is Trading Above The G7 Price Cap Everywhere","The G7's $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian oil, initially designed to prevent a ""devastating surge of inflation"" by maintaining supply, is largely failing. Russian Urals crude is trading significantly above the cap, recently at $75 per barrel from its ports and reaching $88 in India. This approaches the global Brent benchmark of around $90.

This situation presents a clear inflationary risk. The US is hesitant to enforce the cap more strictly, fearing that disrupting crude flows would cause further price hikes. This reluctance highlights the direct conflict between geopolitical goals and managing inflation. The desire to avoid higher energy prices, a key driver of inflation, appears to be tempering the enforcement of the sanctions, underscoring the sensitivity of US policy to inflationary pressures stemming from global energy markets."

This surge in energy costs is fueling fears within the US administration of a potential ""massive energy crisis.""

Such a crisis would have a significant economic impact, driving up inflation and potentially harming the US economy in an important election year. According to the article, the US has sought to prevent these attacks to avoid this inflationary scenario, viewing the threat to Russian energy infrastructure as a risk to its own economic stability."

2024-04-12 16:25:19,A new narrative emerging for gold,"The article questions gold's role as a direct inflation hedge, noting its price has historically decoupled from CPI. While gold and high inflation moved together in the 1970s, this correlation weakened in subsequent decades. In the early 2020s, gold prices were stagnant despite high inflation. Conversely, in 2024, gold is hitting all-time highs while inflation is reportedly cooling and the Fed funds rate is at 5.5%.

The discussion suggests official CPI figures may be misleading. Citing alternative views, it posits ""real inflation,"" including costs like housing and insurance, could be closer to 10%. While the speakers argue gold is more of a ""safe haven"" asset than an inflation hedge, they note a potential resurgence of inflation, linked to rising oil prices, could be a future catalyst for investors."

The piece also highlights concerns over government spending, projecting that interest on US debt will surge from $1.1 trillion to $1.6 trillion by the end of 2024, becoming the nation's single largest expense.

March headline CPI rose to 3.5% from 3.2%, while core inflation held at 3.8%. Supercore inflation (core services ex-housing) increased to 4.8% year-over-year, with core services inflation showing an accelerating 3-month annualized rate of 8%. For 10 of the past 12 months, CPI has stayed above 3%.

The article suggests the official CPI understates true inflation, citing gold's rally as a better indicator. Consumer inflation expectations are also rising, according to the University of Michigan survey. In response to this stubborn price inflation, Federal Reserve members are walking back expectations for 2024 rate cuts. The author concludes that a 3.5% inflation rate is the ""new normal"" for the foreseeable future."

Investors are betting on continued price hikes due to several factors. US gasoline inventories were 2% below the ten-year seasonal average in early April, while strong consumer demand is expected, driven by employment and income growth.

Supply is threatened by Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries and a forecast for an ""extremely active"" hurricane season, which could disrupt US Gulf Coast refineries. While still below their 2022 peak, inflation-adjusted gasoline prices have risen from a recent low of $3.22 in January 2024. The combination of tight supply and robust demand for fuel points to a significant potential contributor to headline inflation in the coming months."

New home prices have declined 20% from their October 2022 peak, a deflationary pressure point. Builders are slashing prices and offering mortgage buydowns to attract buyers. These developments highlight the severe economic consequences of the ongoing policy response to combat persistent inflation, with increasing risks projected for 2025 if high rates persist."

It speculates that a wider regional war could cause a significant oil price shock, potentially pushing Brent crude above $100 per barrel and possibly to $150. Such a surge in energy costs would be a major driver of future inflation. The text suggests this concern over rising oil prices and its inflationary consequences is a key reason the US is advocating for de-escalation and seeking to avoid a broader conflict, fearing the economic fallout."
2024-04-14 16:12:00,One Bank [Finally] Says Quiet Part Out Loud On Gold Manipulation,"The article references the high-inflation period of the late 1970s under Fed Chairman Paul Volcker to frame its discussion on gold. During that time, the Volcker Fed fought soaring inflation by raising the federal funds rate from 10% in 1979 to a peak of 20% in March 1980. This aggressive policy was a response to US CPI inflation which peaked at 14.8% YoY in March 1980.

The author notes that, according to an anecdote, Volcker regretted not stopping gold's price rise during that inflationary period. This historical context is used to suggest that authorities today may be similarly motivated to manage the price of gold. A soaring gold price, much like a surging oil price, is presented as being against the interests of authorities concerned with managing the economy and inflation."

This trend suggests potential upward pressure on future inflation readings, as higher oil costs typically filter through the economy, affecting the prices of various goods and services."

2024-04-16 07:20:00,Central Banks Are Wrong About Rate-Cuts,"The article posits that inflation is a monetary phenomenon, directly caused by central banks printing money to finance unsustainable government deficits. This process destroys a currency's purchasing power. The author criticizes the European Central Bank (ECB) for considering a premature interest rate cut, noting that Eurozone inflation remains persistent and above the 2% target.

Since 2019, accumulated inflation has reached 20%, and the author suggests the real inflation rate for non-replaceable goods is closer to 4-5% annually. While the focus is on the ECB, the principles are applied to central banks like the Federal Reserve. The author warns that lowering rates now is a mistake that risks devaluing the currency, increasing import costs, and further fueling inflation, ultimately benefiting governments at the expense of citizens' savings and wages."

The piece positions high inflation as a significant danger to investments, alongside market downturns and a potential dollar crisis.

While it forecasts significant inflation, the article does not provide specific data, such as target inflation rates, CPI figures, or interest rate projections. It serves as an introduction to an interview where Casey will reportedly share insights and strategies for navigating these financial predicaments."

A senior official claimed these actions ""will not increase inflation.""

However, the article counters this, arguing that basic economics suggests higher tariffs can spark inflation by raising the cost of production inputs, leading to higher output prices.

This policy proposal occurs while US inflation is reportedly ""reaccelerating"" and has not returned to the Federal Reserve's sub-2% target. The article suggests the tariff announcement is a political move, contrasting the administration's claims with the potential for the policy to fuel further price increases."
2024-04-17 07:45:00,Peter Schiff: The Data Looks Grim For The Dollar,"The latest US CPI report indicated persistent inflation, showing a 0.4% monthly increase. This pushed year-over-year inflation to 3.5%, moving further from the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

Despite this data, the Fed is still considering interest rate cuts. The author argues this is a mistake, contending that the rising gold price signals significant underlying inflation that policymakers and the media are ignoring. Instead of cuts, the author suggests aggressive rate hikes are needed to control inflation, proposing increases as large as 200 basis points.

The article concludes that if the Fed continues its current inflationary policy, it will further devalue the dollar and worsen an impending economic crisis."
2024-04-17 08:11:18,Futures Rebound After 3 Day Rout As Rates Drop From 2024 Highs,"Recent data suggests US inflation is more persistent than anticipated, prompting a hawkish shift from the Federal Reserve. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated it will likely ""take longer than expected"" to gain confidence that inflation is returning to the 2% target, noting policy can remain steady ""as long as needed.""

Consequently, market expectations for 2024 interest rate cuts have collapsed from six at the start of the year to two or fewer. This shift is fueled by a resilient US economy and geopolitical tensions fanning inflation fears. Reflecting these concerns, the US 2-year inflation swap rate reached a one-year high of 2.68%, while 10-year Treasury yields climbed to a five-month high of 4.67%. The Fed's upcoming Beige Book will provide further economic insights."

2024-04-17 15:31:40,The US government shattered its own quarterly debt record,"The article argues that massive US government debt will inevitably lead to higher inflation. With the national debt approaching $35 trillion, the Treasury is issuing record amounts of new debt ($7.2 trillion in Q1 2024) to refinance maturing bonds. This has pushed interest rates higher, with 90-day T-bill yields rising from 0.5% to over 5% in two years, creating an unsustainable interest burden.

The author predicts the Federal Reserve will be forced to intervene by cutting rates and expanding the money supply to ensure government solvency. This is expected despite recent rising inflation. The article concludes the Fed is choosing to tolerate inflation as the ""lesser of two evils"" compared to a government default, a policy choice that will ultimately result in more inflation for the US economy."

The central theme is how to protect wealth from the ""relentless erosion of purchasing power"" caused by inflation. Rule advocates for physical gold as a primary strategy to safeguard assets. He presents a bullish case for the commodity, suggesting a future gold price as high as $9,000 is not farfetched in the current inflationary environment.

This rate is significantly higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, occurring despite the Fed raising interest rates to a 23-year high.

The author argues that the Biden administration’s deficit spending is counteracting the Fed's restrictive policies, fueling continued price increases. The piece highlights staggering cumulative price rises since early 2021, including gasoline (up 47.5%), eggs (up 49.3%), and electricity (up 28.3%). This persistent inflation is presented as a primary reason for public dissatisfaction with the economy, with the author concluding that ""Bidenomics"" means consumers are paying more for less."

2024-04-17 22:20:00,"It's Not Rate Hikes That Are ""Sparking An Economic Boom"", It's The Fiscal Stimulus","The article discusses shifting US inflation expectations and Federal Reserve policy. Market forecasts for 2024 have dramatically changed, moving from an anticipated seven rate cuts to now considering the possibility of two rate hikes. This uncertainty is fueled by debates over monetary policy's effects. Some argue rate cuts are necessary to lower inflation by addressing housing supply issues. Conversely, others question if high rates are paradoxically stimulating the economy.

Fed Chair Powell has stated he is prepared to keep rates steady ""as long as needed"" to manage inflation. The piece also notes the connection between interest rates and ""supply-side inflation,"" highlighting the complexity of the current economic environment. The ECB is similarly cautious, linking its own potential rate cuts to the absence of new inflation shocks."

This trend is part of a broader ""weak bull"" market for commodities, including nickel. The key takeaway is that these increasing raw material costs are considered ""bad news for Fed chair Powell's fight against the inflation monster."" This suggests that rising commodity prices could contribute to persistent or renewed inflationary pressures, complicating monetary policy decisions aimed at price stability."

While the strikes initially idled nearly 14% of Russia's refining capacity, US officials have reportedly warned Ukraine to halt them.

The primary US concern is that disrupting Russian energy infrastructure could cause a significant spike in global oil prices, potentially pushing Brent crude above $100 per barrel. Such a surge would directly fuel US inflation through higher energy and transportation costs. This is viewed as a major economic and political risk for the Biden administration ahead of the election. The article suggests US foreign policy is being shaped by the goal of keeping oil prices—and by extension, inflation—in check before November."

This trend is evident in both consumer and institutional behavior. Retail sales are strong, with Costco reportedly selling up to $200 million in gold bars monthly. Central banks are also accumulating gold in large quantities, likely as a hedge against inflation, purchasing 1,037 metric tons in 2023. The article frames the surging interest in gold as a direct response to ongoing inflation, although it does not provide specific inflation rate figures or forecasts."

2024-04-18 19:05:40,The halving is upon us,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that consistent, firm inflation readings have reduced the likelihood of early interest rate cuts in 2024. The central bank needs more time to gain confidence that inflation is sustainably moving towards its target. This shift reflects concerns over prolonged inflationary pressures.

Despite the Fed's cautious stance, President Biden indicated a rate cut this summer remains possible. One analyst suggests a US Treasury strategy of letting inflation ""run a little hot"" to help manage debt by issuing lower-yielding bonds. The current high-interest rate environment, maintained to combat inflation, is also creating significant stress in the commercial real estate sector, as firms face refinancing at much higher rates."

This economic pressure is dampening consumer spending on high-end items.

While the piece does not provide specific US inflation rates, CPI data, or forecasts, it highlights a key consequence of the high-inflation environment: restrictive monetary policy. This policy is presented as a reason, alongside China's slow recovery, for the significant drop in demand for luxury goods like Swiss watches, whose exports fell 16.1% in March."

The author notes the current 5.5% interest rate environment creates risks of a market crash. It is believed the Federal Reserve would respond to a crash by printing money, regardless of how high inflation is. This action would likely cause assets with a fixed supply to increase in price. While the US is not currently experiencing hyperinflation, the piece suggests significant inflationary pressures are building due to fiscal dominance and geopolitical tensions, making sound money assets an obvious choice for investors."

2024-04-19 08:05:09,"Futures Reverse All Losses, Oil Slides After Iran Plays Down Israeli Attacks, Signals No Retaliation","Recent market activity reflects concerns over persistent US inflation, which has prompted hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve. Solid economic readings, including jobless claims at 212k and the Philadelphia Fed’s business outlook hitting a two-year high of 15.5, support a cautious monetary policy stance.

Several Fed officials have signaled a ""higher for longer"" approach. NY Fed President Williams stated a rate hike is possible if data warrants it, while Atlanta's Bostic doesn't expect cuts until late 2024. This has forced investors to revise expectations, with markets now pricing in only 41bp of rate cuts by year-end. Analysts warn that with ""sticky inflation,"" the Fed cannot ignore potential oil price spikes, reinforcing the need to maintain restrictive policy."
2024-04-19 08:20:00,Economic Warning From The NFIB,"Based on the NFIB small business survey, the article highlights economic warnings that suggest a shift in US inflation dynamics. High interest rates, the primary tool against inflation, are straining businesses, with confidence falling to an 11-year low.

In response to weakening demand and poor sales, business owners are cutting plans to raise worker compensation. This slowdown in wage growth, a key inflationary pressure, suggests future inflation may ease. While consumers still face ""rising living costs,"" the broad economic weakness indicated by the survey is significant. The author suggests these recessionary signals could explain why the Federal Reserve is becoming more adamant about cutting interest rates, indicating a potential pivot away from its aggressive anti-inflationary policy toward supporting economic growth."

2024-04-19 13:06:48,World War III Fear Boosts Gold & Oil on Bitcoin Halving Day,"Geopolitical tensions are fueling US inflation fears. The conflict in the Middle East threatens to cause a massive spike in crude oil prices, with the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a 40-year low. This could lead to significantly higher gas prices.

The US economy remains ""nominally hot,"" prompting the Federal Reserve to consider further interest rate hikes and hold rates higher for longer. This sentiment is reflected in rising bond yields, with the 10-year yield up 80 basis points. Concerns over the large US budget deficit, which could expand to fund a conflict, are stoking fears of future ""money printing"" and monetary debasement. As a result, investors are seeking hedges, with gold—viewed as a reflection of true price inflation—up 17.8% year-to-date."
2024-04-19 17:27:39,Why gold is shrugging off rates AND inflation,"Jeff Deist argues that US inflation will remain ""stubborn"" for at least a decade. While the official CPI is around 3%, he contends the actual rate is much higher, potentially 8-10%, citing how calculations have changed since the 1980s.

This persistent inflation is attributed more to fiscal policy than monetary policy, specifically the over $6 trillion in direct cash stimulus injected during the COVID pandemic. Regulatory and supply-side issues also contribute. This environment creates negative real returns for investors, where asset gains of 4-5% are eroded by higher real inflation. Americans are feeling the pain of rising prices for essentials, and investors are now focused on simply preserving capital against inflation, seeking returns of 5-7% just to tread water."
2024-04-19 18:00:00,The World's Economic Myths Are Hitting Their Limits,"The article suggests conflicting pressures on US price levels. Potential inflationary drivers include high-priced electricity from green energy sources. Conversely, higher interest rates, used to combat inflation, are negatively impacting sectors like solar, with homeowner installations forecast to fall 13% in 2024.

However, the analysis points to a significant deflationary risk. As China’s property sector declines, it is increasing its manufacturing exports. This threatens to flood global markets with low-priced goods, forcing down prices for competing manufacturers. This could lead to lower wages and prices in economies like the US, potentially causing debt bubbles to collapse as borrowers struggle with repayments."

Despite these optimistic assumptions, the CBO projects public debt will reach a minimum of $140 trillion by 2054. This would result in annual interest payments of $10 trillion, even with interest rates comparable to the 1986-1997 period. The author argues that significant government spending, like the $95 billion foreign aid package, is fiscally unsustainable, particularly given the unrealistic assumption of stable inflation and interest rates. This fiscal trajectory is described as putting the nation on the cusp of a ""doomsday machine."""

This is a top concern for 70% of the population, with average monthly rent surging 50% in four years, from $1400 in 2019 to $2100.

The Federal Reserve's strategy of using higher interest rates to deflate the housing bubble has reportedly failed to curb these prices. The piece also cites ""general inflation"" as a key factor, with skyrocketing building material and labor costs contributing to the housing crisis. This indicates that shelter costs are a persistent and significant driver of inflation for US households, impacting even middle-income earners and those making over $100,000. The problem is compounded by a severe housing supply shortage."

This has prompted uniformly hawkish commentary from Federal Reserve officials.

Even noted dove Austan Goolsbee acknowledged the setback, stating that after three months of unfavorable data, the trend ""can’t be dismissed"" and it ""makes sense to wait"" before moving on interest rates.

Consequently, market expectations for rate cuts in 2024 and 2025 have plunged. This shift has pushed Treasury yields higher, with yields rising by around 8-10bps for the week. Investors are now awaiting the upcoming March PCE inflation report for more clarity on the future path of prices and monetary policy."

Mises argues these price rises are not uniform. Instead, they occur ""step by step"" as the new money circulates. This process creates economic ""winners"" (those who receive the new money first) and ""losers,"" thereby altering the distribution of wealth. The article highlights Mises's view that the gold standard served as a check against this ""inflationist tendency."" He considered fiat money inflation a subtle and destructive policy, even linking it to the downfall of major civilizations like the Roman Empire.

This risk is now compounded by a new policy allowing the confiscation of foreign assets, specifically Russia's.

The author argues that foreign nations holding US dollar assets will likely demand higher interest rates to compensate for this added confiscation risk. This demand for higher rates would be particularly damaging for the US, given its ""unprecedented levels of debt."" The combination of high deficit spending and the new asset risk could therefore lead to increased borrowing costs, further straining the US economy and potentially threatening the US dollar's long-term stability."

The seizure of a ship in the Strait of Hormuz has amplified fears of a major ""supply shock"" caused by disruptions to critical maritime chokepoints.

Analysts warn that any disruption to the Strait of Hormuz, a key passage for global trade and oil, could have a ""huge"" impact. Such a supply shock would directly fuel inflation by severely constraining the flow of goods and spiking oil prices. This would increase energy and transportation costs, ultimately leading to higher prices for businesses and consumers. The events are presented as a direct threat to price stability, creating potential for future inflation."

This has pushed back expectations for interest rate cuts in 2024, with some officials suggesting hikes are possible if data warrants. This persistent inflation, described as a ""boomerang,"" contrasts with the outlook in Europe and the UK.

The European Central Bank is signaling a potential rate cut in June despite sticky services inflation. In the UK, March CPI slowed less than expected to 3.2% YoY, but the Bank of England is still anticipated to cut rates before the Fed. The Fed may leverage a strong dollar and rising yields to tighten financial conditions indirectly, aiming to weaken the economy and curb inflation, which remains largely supply-driven."

A Census Bureau survey conducted between March 5 and April 1 found many residents in major metro areas have difficulty paying for household expenses and energy bills. This is supported by the Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book, which noted that consumer spending ""barely increased"" due to weakness in discretionary spending, a potential reaction to high prices.

The article explicitly states that ""inflation is on the rise,"" attributing this to current economic policies described as ""failed Bidenomics.""

The true measure of inflation, according to the text, is the price of gold, which has hit record highs against all currencies, including the dollar.

While US interest rate cuts are still considered possible this year, external factors pose risks. Actions by the Bank of Japan to strengthen the yen could push US bond yields higher, increasing borrowing costs. Furthermore, a potential oil price spike from geopolitical conflict is noted as a significant inflationary threat, which could complicate the economic outlook and the Federal Reserve's policy decisions."

Consequently, traders are recalibrating expectations, pushing back the timeline for the Fed's first interest rate cut. Market focus is now on upcoming data, particularly the US core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Economists forecast a +0.30% monthly increase for the core PCE deflator. This would bring the year-over-year rate to 2.7%, potentially rounding to 2.8%. These inflation concerns are causing bond yields to climb as markets adjust to the prospect of delayed rate cuts."

It explains how this climate enables the creation of new ETFs offering 100% downside protection.

According to Matt Kaufman of Calamos, with “risk-free rates north of 5%,” the cost of hedging with options decreases as rates rise. This allows issuers to deliver products with full capital protection while still offering some upside potential. These funds are being launched amid fluctuating interest rates, providing a new option for risk-averse investors who are impacted by the economic conditions created by the fight against inflation."

In contrast, global inflation pressures persist. Australian consumer price inflation for Q1 was hotter than expected at +3.6% year-over-year, slowing less than anticipated and causing a spike in Australian bond yields. In Europe, a Bank of England official struck a hawkish tone, warning against the risks of easing policy too early should inflation persist. Despite these signals, one analyst noted that for US tech investors, inflation is not a primary concern at the moment."

Soaring domestic pump prices challenge the political narrative that US inflation has been fixed.

However, there are signs of demand destruction in response to higher costs. Implied gasoline demand has fallen, reaching its lowest point since 2014 compared to pre-pandemic levels. This swift consumer reaction to price hikes could be a disinflationary force.

Despite this, geopolitical tensions and tightening market indicators, such as the Brent futures backwardation widening to $1.05, continue to pose an upside risk to energy prices. This suggests potential for renewed inflationary pressures from the energy sector."
2024-04-24 11:15:14,Gold Price Just Dropped! What Happened?,"The article posits that gold remains a strong investment, with its status as an inflation hedge being a key fundamental driver. While the gold price has recently pulled back, this is attributed to factors like shifting expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which are a primary tool for managing inflation.

The long-term bullish outlook for gold is supported by persistent inflation and escalating U.S. debt levels. The article reaffirms that despite short-term market fluctuations, gold’s role as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation remains unchanged, suggesting these economic pressures are expected to continue."

The author describes this as a ""tax on inflation"" and notes that ""Biden's high inflation makes this especially painful.""

For example, when a small business owner sells their company after many years, a large portion of the calculated gain may be due to inflation. Under the proposed tax hike, this illusory gain would still be taxed. The piece criticizes this for effectively taxing the inflation created by government policy."

The author expresses concern that Federal Trade Commission (FTC) actions to block major energy company mergers are politically motivated and threaten the sector's stability. By obstructing these deals, the FTC risks undermining America's energy independence and the industry's ability to function smoothly. This could lead to significant disruptions and higher energy prices for consumers and businesses, potentially exacerbating existing inflationary pressures throughout the economy.

The author notes that refinancing this massive debt at higher interest rates will cause interest payments to surge. This year, interest costs are projected to exceed defense spending for the first time. This unsustainable fiscal path is presented as a long-term threat to the dollar's value, leading to a ""declining currency."" The article posits that these conditions will likely boost the value of assets like gold, as central banks and individuals seek protection from the dollar's potential devaluation."

2024-04-26 07:00:00,The US Economy is on The Cusp of Stagflation,"Recent US economic data indicates a troubling trend of slowing growth alongside accelerating inflation, raising concerns of potential stagflation. While Q1 GDP growth slowed significantly from 3.4% to 1.6%, quarterly Core PCE inflation, a key metric for the Federal Reserve, accelerated from 2% to 3.7%. This divergence, with sticky consumer prices remaining 'red hot', suggests headline CPI could soon surpass 4%.

In response, markets are pricing in persistent inflation and higher interest rates. Expectations for Fed rate cuts have drastically shifted; anticipated cuts by December have fallen from over six to just one. Continued high inflation data could eliminate rate cut prospects for the year entirely, as the Fed holds rates firm to combat rising prices."
2024-04-26 07:20:00,"""Our Enemy, The Fed""","This article reviews a book arguing that the US Federal Reserve is the primary cause of harmful inflation. It notes the Fed’s official goal is 2% inflation for “price stability,” but this policy has drained 96% of the dollar’s purchasing power since 1914. The author questions how such devaluation constitutes stability.

The piece contrasts current policy with the 1920-21 depression, where a 56% fall in wholesale prices (deflation) was followed by a swift recovery without monetary intervention. It presents the book's core argument that the establishment fears deflation because it hurts government and Wall Street. Conversely, inflation continuously harms the general public by devaluing their money. The review concludes that the Fed’s real purpose is to inflate the currency, creating boom-bust cycles and debasing the dollar."

Consensus expects both headline and core PCE to rise by 0.3% month-over-month.

This release follows concerning Q1 data that revealed a stagflationary mix of slower GDP growth (+1.6%) and persistent inflation. In Q1, core PCE inflation accelerated to a +3.7% annualized rate, surpassing the +3.4% forecast, while headline PCE hit +3.4%. This upside surprise has pushed back expectations for Fed interest rate cuts. Markets are now pricing in just 34 basis points of cuts for 2024, with the first full 25bp cut not anticipated until December. A hotter-than-expected March PCE reading would likely reinforce the view that US rates will remain higher for longer."
2024-04-26 08:25:00,China Is Pivotal For US Inflation's Path,"US inflation is proving more stubborn than anticipated, with upside risks to the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) release following a higher-than-expected core-PCE index. Analysis suggests much of the recent disinflation was driven by acyclical factors, not Federal Reserve policy. This acyclical component is highly correlated with China's Producer Price Index (PPI), indicating China is a major driver of global inflation.

China is currently facing deflationary pressures. If it responds with broad economic stimulus, as it has historically when its bond yields fall, this would create an unwelcome boost for US inflation. Such a move would exacerbate already embedded price growth in the US and add upward pressure on long-term yields."
2024-04-26 08:39:04,Fed's Favorite Inflation Indicator Prints Hotter-Than-Expected As Savings Rate Plunges,"Recent US inflation data came in hotter than expected, challenging hopes for imminent Federal Reserve rate cuts. The March Core PCE Deflator, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, held at 2.8% year-over-year, above the 2.7% forecast. The headline PCE also accelerated to 2.7% YoY.

A key concern is the 3-month annualized core PCE, which surged to 4.4%, indicating persistent inflationary pressure. This rise was driven primarily by the services sector. Strong consumer spending, which rose 0.8% month-over-month, outpaced income growth and pushed the personal savings rate down to 3.2%, its lowest since November 2022. Accelerating wage growth and high underlying ""acyclical"" core inflation suggest that price pressures remain stubborn, casting doubt on the likelihood of rate cuts this year."

The strikes have contributed to a rise in Brent crude prices to around $90 per barrel, increasing war risk premiums. These higher energy costs directly feed into US inflation, with average gasoline prices climbing from $3.10 in January to $3.66.

This exacerbates an existing ""uptick in US consumer price inflation, driven by services, housing and fuel."" Experts warn that if Ukraine expands its attacks to target Russia's crude export facilities, it could further disrupt global supplies. This would drive oil prices significantly higher, putting substantial upward pressure on US inflation and cost-of-living, a key concern for the Biden administration."

While acknowledging that inflation rates have been in decline for the past two years, Kupperman believes this forced pivot is imminent. The resulting monetary expansion is expected to cause an ""explosion in inflation-linked asset prices."" He views precious metals as an indicator that this major inflationary event is approaching, potentially after a short-term market dip."

2024-04-26 10:09:57,UMich Inflation Expectations Accelerated In April To 2024 Highs,"According to the University of Michigan survey, short-term US inflation expectations rose in April, reaching their highest level since November 2023. The final one-year inflation forecast increased to 3.2%, up from 2.9% in March.

This growing concern over rising prices is impacting households. The survey revealed that 38% of consumers feel high prices are weighing on their living standards, an increase from 33% the prior month. This frustration contributed to a decline in overall consumer sentiment, with measures of current conditions and future expectations falling to four-month lows. While consumers expressed frustration over day-to-day costs, price concerns for large purchases like vehicles and homes were little changed."

Again,"The article highlights the stark contrast between US and Japanese inflation environments, which drives currency dynamics. The yen's weakness is attributed to the significant interest rate gap between the two nations. US interest rates are at multi-decade highs due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening cycle to combat high post-COVID inflation.

In contrast, Japan is not experiencing a major inflation problem. Its core CPI is around 2% and decelerating, with Tokyo's CPI at 1.7%. The Bank of Japan sees ""no major impact"" from the weak yen on underlying inflation and shows no urgency to hike rates. The market's continued focus on US inflation is underscored by the mention of upcoming US PCE data, a key indicator expected to influence short-term market movements."

The failure of Republic First Bancorp is presented as a symptom of this stress.

The core concern is that the stability of US banks, which hold nearly $400 billion in unrealized losses, was based on the assumption of significant Fed rate cuts this year. The article questions whether these cuts will happen. The implication is that if inflation remains persistent, preventing the Fed from lowering rates, the pressure on the banking system will intensify, potentially leading to more failures. The piece therefore frames the banking crisis as a direct consequence of the prolonged fight against inflation."

This surge is driven by specific market factors rather than general economic trends.

Supply is constrained by hotel closures, industry consolidation, and high interest rates discouraging new construction. Concurrently, demand is inflated by a regulatory crackdown that delisted 80% of NYC Airbnb properties and by city contracts buying rooms for migrants at a 73% markup over normal rates. Rising operational costs from labor shortages and wage hikes are also passed on to consumers. The piece explains the microeconomic drivers of these sector-specific price increases, rather than discussing broader national inflation metrics like the CPI."

Key drivers mentioned include a lack of fiscal conservatism, with government debt increasing by $1 trillion every 100 days, which could devalue the dollar long-term. The Federal Reserve is described as ""trapped,"" facing scrutiny over its policies. The bond market is presented as a critical risk, with rising yields potentially triggering ""serious earthquakes"" in the economy. A recent dip in the money supply for the first time since November is also noted as a key indicator. The overall sentiment suggests a challenging inflationary environment driven by fiscal policy and market pressures."

2024-04-28 23:15:00,'FX Vigilantes' Strike - Yen Suddenly Crashes To April 1990 Lows Against The Dollar,"The article focuses on Japanese inflation amid the yen's sharp decline, noting the Bank of Japan (BoJ) sees little inflationary impact from the currency's weakness. BoJ Governor Ueda indicated policy might change if the effect on underlying inflation becomes too significant.

Analysts argue Japan does not have a major inflation problem, justifying the BoJ's reluctance to raise interest rates. Japan's core CPI is around 2% and decelerating, with recent Tokyo CPI at 1.7%. This contrasts with the high post-COVID inflation that prompted aggressive rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve. A BoJ policy shift is deemed unlikely unless its inflation forecasts move well above 2%. The article concludes that a true reversal for the yen would require lower US yields, which would stem from a weaker US economy and easing inflation."

2024-04-29 05:30:00,"If Treasuries Hit 5%, You're Gonna See Some Serious Sh*t","Experts warn that persistent US inflation is pushing the 10-year Treasury yield towards a critical breaking point. The yield recently reached 4.7% as bond traders sell bonds to pressure the Federal Reserve into maintaining its fight against inflation rather than cutting rates.

Analysts like Peter Schiff forecast that a 10-year yield surpassing 5% would be ""perilous territory,"" causing significant economic stress. This creates a dilemma for the Fed: it needs to keep rates high to combat inflation and make government debt attractive, but doing so risks severe economic damage and increases burdensome debt servicing costs. The rising yield is a key indicator that markets expect inflation to remain a persistent problem, forcing the Fed to act."

Annually, headline PCE was 2.7% and core PCE was 2.8%, both slightly above expectations. This data was described as ""worrying"" and has reinforced market views for fewer Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2024, with only 34bps of cuts now anticipated by December.

Consequently, the Fed is expected to maintain a hawkish stance at its upcoming meeting. Chair Powell will likely signal that borrowing costs will remain high for longer due to the lack of progress on disinflation. A strong labor market, with April payrolls forecast to grow by 240k, further supports this cautious approach to monetary policy."

2024-04-30 06:55:00,Big Government's Crackdown On Hedge Fund Home-Buying Looms,"The article discusses how large-scale corporate buying of residential homes contributes to US inflation by driving up housing prices. Institutional investors purchased over 25% of single-family homes in the first quarter, a near-record high. This activity is blamed for creating a housing shortage and making homeownership unaffordable for many Americans already struggling in an ""era of high inflation."" In response, lawmakers are proposing bills to force hedge funds to sell their housing portfolios. However, some analysts argue the root cause is not the funds but the Federal Reserve's past policies of record-low interest rates, which distorted the market. The issue highlights the significant impact of rising shelter costs on overall inflation and household financial stress."
2024-04-30 07:20:00,Peter Schiff: Stagflation Finally Revealed,"The US economy is showing signs of stagflation, with weak Q1 GDP growth of 1.6% and a persistently high Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index of 2.8%. This combination of a weak economy and stubborn inflation creates a difficult situation for the Federal Reserve, making it reluctant to raise interest rates.

The article argues that official inflation figures likely underestimate the true price increases felt by consumers, who are spending more simply because things cost more. This is supported by a declining personal savings rate, which has dropped to 3.2%, indicating Americans are struggling financially. The author suggests that a weak economy and widening budget deficits could lead to more money printing, fueling further inflation in the future."
