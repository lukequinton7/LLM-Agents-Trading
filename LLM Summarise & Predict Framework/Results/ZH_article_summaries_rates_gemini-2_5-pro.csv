US debt is increasing by $1 trillion every three months, pushing the interest expense to a record $1.1 trillion. This interest cost is rising by $100 billion every four months.

According to BofA strategist Michael Hartnett, this escalating fiscal burden is a ""big motivation"" for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. The primary objective of such cuts would be to constrain the surge in government borrowing costs. This potential policy is being termed ""Interest Cost Control,"" suggesting future Fed decisions may be heavily influenced by the need to manage the nation's soaring debt service payments."

2024-03-31 00:16:56,Weaponizing The Economy,"The article highlights growing inflationary pressures that could complicate future FED decisions. The Baltimore bridge collapse is expected to disrupt auto supply chains, impeding ""car disinflation"" as new car prices remain 20% above pre-pandemic levels.

Rising oil prices, driven by geopolitical conflicts, add to these pressures, with the article warning of a potential 1970s-style stagflation scenario. This environment creates ""Forward Confusion"" for central banks regarding the path of inflation. The text notes a historical 6-month lag between the NY Fed's supply chain pressure index and US CPI changes, suggesting current disruptions could soon translate into higher inflation. Overall, deglobalization, war, and supply shocks are cited as drivers of higher inflation and bond yields, challenging the outlook for interest rates."

However, these elevated rates have also led to soaring interest payments, causing the national debt to increase by an unprecedented $1 trillion every 100 days.

The author dismisses claims that immigration is boosting the economy. Instead, it is argued that past Federal Reserve stimulus created an inflated, low-wage jobs market. The piece forecasts that the continued impact of higher interest rates will cause jobs to ""inevitably plummet,"" leading to higher unemployment in 2024, as also noted in a CBO report. This will ultimately drag the economy down."

Despite this hawkish Fed stance and a strong dollar, assets like gold and stocks have been rallying. The author argues this is not driven by expectations of a US rate cut. Instead, the market movement is likely fueled by anticipation of a major stimulus ""bazooka"" from China. Reports suggest China's central bank may begin a form of Quantitative Easing by buying its own government bonds. This potential Chinese liquidity injection, rather than a change in Fed policy, is presented as the reason for the current asset rally."

This sentiment is reinforced by the latest core PCE inflation print, the Fed's preferred gauge, which came in ""fractionally below expectations.""

While not forecasting specific rate changes, these two points—a dovish Fed chair and lower-than-expected inflation—suggest that the conditions supporting potential rate stability or future cuts are strengthening. The market's subsequent rally, described as a ""meltup,"" reflects investor optimism that the Federal Reserve will not pursue a more hawkish, rate-hiking policy in the near term."

2024-04-01 07:20:00,"Spending, Income, And Inflation Data Do Not Support Fed Interest Rate Cuts","The February 2024 Personal Income and Outlays report suggests the Federal Reserve should not cut interest rates. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.3% month-over-month. This increase, more precisely 0.333%, annualizes to nearly 4.0%, which is double the Fed's 2.0% inflation target.

Despite this data, along with rising rent and home prices, the author notes the market expects a rate cut in June, largely due to the Fed’s own guidance. It is suggested the Fed will likely proceed with a cut unless upcoming economic data is significantly hotter than anticipated."
2024-04-01 08:30:16,Are You Ready For the Second Wave of Inflation?,"The article argues the Federal Reserve is a partisan institution, not politically independent. It claims the Fed supported the Obama administration by keeping interest rates at zero for seven years and only hiking once in 2015 and 2016.

Conversely, after Donald Trump's 2016 election, the Fed began raising rates three to four times per year while draining liquidity.

Currently, the author alleges the Fed is aiding the Biden administration by promising to cut rates despite inflation not reaching its 2% target. This is presented as a political move to boost asset prices during an election year, which the author believes is causing a second wave of inflation."

The article highlights that interest payments on the debt are projected to reach $870 billion this year. It notes that the Federal Reserve’s recent rate increases are a key reason debt service payments rose by 32% since last year.

The author argues this massive debt burden will compel the Fed to maintain low interest rates to manage servicing costs. This policy is predicted to fuel inflation and devalue the dollar, potentially leading to an economic crisis. A proposed solution involves forbidding the Federal Reserve from purchasing federal debt instruments to break this cycle."

This has led to a significant shift in expectations, with the probability of a rate cut at the June FOMC meeting falling below 50%. Paradoxically, gold has continued to rally to all-time highs even as the likelihood of a near-term rate cut diminishes. The author also notes that mounting uncertainty over US debt and its manageability could be a contributing factor to market movements, independent of immediate Fed policy decisions."

Einhorn’s hawkish stance is driven by his view that ""inflation is re-accelerating."" He sees this as part of a larger problem with US monetary and fiscal policies, which he described as ""systemically too loose,"" citing unsustainable government deficits. This macroeconomic concern underpins his large position in gold as a hedge against potential instability."

2024-04-04 07:20:00,Gold's Defiance Of Real Yields Can't Last Unless Trouble Brewing,"The article discusses gold's price in relation to real yields, noting the current rally is unusual as it occurs despite high 10-year real yields of around 2%. This is a departure from past gold surges, which happened during periods of negative real yields, such as during the pandemic and the 2011-12 European debt crisis.

While the piece references yields, which are influenced by central bank policy, it does not contain specific details on US Federal Reserve decisions, future interest rate forecasts, or the economic indicators driving potential Fed actions. The focus is on the gold market's reaction to the current yield environment, not on the monetary policy creating that environment."

This stance signals a pivot towards an easing cycle, with the end of quantitative tightening (QT) also anticipated. The expectation of lower rates is supported by signs that bond yields are peaking and inflation continues to trend lower, despite some bumpiness.

This move by the Fed is part of a broader global trend, with central banks expected to begin a synchronized easing cycle. The Fed's accommodative policy and pending rate cuts are contributing to easier financial conditions and supporting a ""soft landing"" scenario for the US economy."

Hoenig forecasts the Fed will face a critical decision within the coming year as recessionary forces build. The central bank must choose between resuming QE, which would lower rates and risk re-igniting inflation, or maintaining its restrictive stance and allowing a recession to occur.

He notes the Fed often prioritizes short-term relief over long-term stability due to pressure from Wall Street and Congress. This suggests future policy may be influenced by these interests rather than purely economic data, creating a pivotal moment for the US economy."

According to Fed Chair Powell, an ""unexpected deterioration"" in the labor market would be required for the Fed to consider earlier rate cuts. However, Powell also suggested that strong jobs growth might not delay cuts if it is matched by an increase in labor supply, which could temper inflation.

While payroll growth is expected to cool, the article speculates on a potential ""shock"" sub-100K print. This is framed against mixed labor market proxies and perceived political pressure on the administration to slash rates."

However, the article argues that the Fed's influence is diminishing in the face of significant fiscal stimulus from the Treasury.

The author suggests that while the bond market is correctly pricing in inflationary pressures, the Fed's power to control the economy via interest rates is waning. This analysis posits that fiscal policy is now the more dominant economic driver. The piece concludes that bond yields ""should yield more"" as markets recalibrate to this new dynamic, questioning the traditional power of the Fed's monetary policy decisions."
2024-04-05 12:05:00,Behind Today's Stellar Jobs Print: It Was Literally ALL Part-Time Jobs (And Illegals),"The March jobs report indicated a strong 303K payroll gain, well above expectations. While a robust labor market typically reduces the likelihood of Federal Reserve rate cuts, the report’s composition complicates this outlook.

The article argues that job quality was poor, with gains driven by a 691K surge in part-time roles as full-time employment fell. It highlights that this growth is concentrated among immigrant workers, which helps suppress wage inflation. This aligns with Fed Chair Powell’s comments that immigration has helped bring the labor market into ""better balance."" This dynamic of strong job growth without significant wage pressure is a key factor for the Fed, potentially influencing its future interest rate decisions by easing inflationary concerns."

The article notes that coffee futures have hit their highest level in over a year and a half, driven by supply issues and market positioning.

This trend of persistent food inflation is described as ""bad news for central banks."" While the US Federal Reserve is not explicitly named, the implication is that rising inflation could complicate monetary policy decisions. Stubborn inflation may pressure central banks to maintain higher interest rates for longer or delay anticipated rate cuts to ensure price stability.

2024-04-06 18:40:00,'Animal Spirits' Update (Or Reflections On Another Fake Unemployment Report),"The latest ""strong"" unemployment report, with the rate at 3.8%, suggests that US interest rates will likely stay ""higher for longer"" than many expect. This labor market data reduces the immediate pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut rates.

The article draws a historical parallel to the 1980-1982 recessions, when the Fed was also battling inflation. During that period, the peak in short-term interest rates, such as the 3-month T-bill rate, occurred a year after the peak in inflation. This precedent suggests that even if current inflation has peaked, a pivot to lower rates by the Fed may not be imminent, potentially leading to a prolonged period of elevated rates."

This suggests divergent policy paths, with the Fed likely to maintain its current stance for longer than its European counterpart. The article mentions a spread between Fed and ECB rate cut probabilities, reinforcing this view, but provides no specific forecasts or economic data for the US."

However, market expectations have since shifted significantly. According to a top endowment CIO, the market has now ""priced out"" 2-3 of those anticipated rate cuts, suggesting a more hawkish outlook for Federal Reserve policy.

Despite the prospect of fewer rate cuts and higher-for-longer interest rates, the stock market has continued to rise. This divergence between changing rate expectations and strong equity performance is highlighted as an ""interesting"" market dynamic."

2024-04-07 23:20:00,"What's So Great About The Great Reset, Great Taking, Great Replacement, Great Deflation, & Next Great Depression?","The article argues the Federal Reserve intentionally created an ""Everything Bubble"" by holding interest rates near zero for most of the last 15 years. This policy is blamed for the current situation where the US national debt increases by $1 trillion every 100 days, with annual interest payments projected to reach $1.6 trillion by the end of 2024.

The author posits this is a deliberate strategy by the Fed to engineer a financial system collapse. Following the bubble's implosion, a ""Great Deflation"" is predicted, which will make debt an insurmountable burden for the public. The Fed, currently holding $1 trillion in unrealized losses, is portrayed as the architect of this planned crisis, which will ultimately lead to a mass transfer of wealth and the implementation of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) for total control."

Despite this, the market widely believes the Fed will proceed with planned rate cuts. A Bank of America strategist notes the market perceives the Fed as ""willing to accommodate higher inflation as it cuts rates.” Surging commodity prices, including a 10% increase in crude oil and a 30% spike in wholesale gasoline, signal potential future inflation pressures that could influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming decisions."

However, the article highlights a significant disconnect between rising inflation uncertainty and currently low bond volatility. Historically, higher inflation volatility leads to more volatile and higher bond yields.

The author forecasts that this gap will close through a rise in bond volatility. Given the persistent inflation risks, this suggests that US bond yields are poised to remain elevated or move higher. The few investors holding short positions are therefore considered to be in a favorable position."

Consequently, his firm is prepared for a very broad range of interest rates, from 2% to 8% or even more. He cautions that if long-end rates surpass 6% alongside a recession, it would cause significant economic stress. Dimon also remains concerned about the unprecedented scale of quantitative tightening, which drains over $900 billion in liquidity annually from the system.

Bond traders’ inflation expectations have risen, signaling doubt that the Fed can achieve its inflation target.

Annual inflation is forecast to remain above 3%, with rising commodity prices adding pressure. Market indicators, such as two-year breakeven rates, suggest average inflation of around 2.85%. This persistent inflation casts significant doubt on the Federal Reserve's ability to deliver its projected six rate cuts by the end of next year.

Bond yields retreated slightly, with the 10-year Treasury around 4.39%, after recently hitting their highest levels since November.

Market pricing has shifted significantly, now factoring in just two rate cuts for 2024, totaling approximately 61.5 basis points. The probability of a cut by the June meeting has dropped to 52%. This contrasts with former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard’s view that three cuts remain the “base case.”

Wednesday’s core CPI is forecast at 3.7% year-on-year, remaining well above the Fed’s 2% target. Some analysts warn of a potentially hotter-than-expected reading, adding to uncertainty about the Fed's path forward."
2024-04-09 08:25:00,"In The Next Several Weeks, We Could See $300 Billion Of Liquidity Leaving The System","The article highlights rising pressure on US interest rates, with the 10-year Treasury yield increasing from 3.78% to 4.40% since December, influenced by surging oil prices. While Fed Chair Powell and the Treasury previously boosted liquidity via the Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) and the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), conditions are shifting.

A significant liquidity drain of over $300 billion is expected from tax payments and the Fed’s ongoing $95 billion monthly Quantitative Tightening (QT). This reduction in liquidity, coupled with the expiration of emergency bank loans, creates market vulnerability. The author speculates the Fed may be forced to intervene to offset the drain if market volatility surges, implying a potential future policy response to stabilize financial conditions."

This non-public information included technical details on key inflation components like rent and used cars.

The integrity of this data is critical for Federal Reserve policy, as the Fed relies heavily on inflation metrics to guide its interest rate decisions. The scandal raises concerns about equitable access to market-moving economic information that influences forecasts. This unfair advantage allows select firms to better predict inflation, impacting investor bets on securities tied to interest rates and potentially pre-empting the Fed's policy direction."

2024-04-10 06:30:00,Treasury Debt - Pristine Collateral Or A Red Flag,"The article highlights concerns over US interest rate manipulation through regulatory changes. A proposed modification to the Supplemental Liquidity Ratio (SLR) could exempt treasuries, enabling banks to become major buyers of government debt.

This follows past Federal Reserve actions, including cutting rates to zero during the COVID crisis and allowing banks to value bonds at ""par"" to avoid realizing losses after the treasury market's 2022 route, where the TLT ETF fell roughly 30%.

The author argues these policies have suppressed interest rates for a decade, destroying true price discovery. This allowed the US to borrow cheaply despite soaring debt. The potential SLR change is seen as a way to absorb current high treasury issuance, which is at levels comparable to the COVID emergency, further distorting market-driven interest rates."

The upcoming US CPI data is a key focus, with a cooler print seen as a major positive for markets.

Despite these concerns, market strategists note that investors are still pricing in rate cuts for this year. JPMorgan describes the Fed as currently ""paused,"" while acknowledging that inflation expectations are strengthening, as shown by rising swap rates. However, some analysts believe the market's focus is shifting from the inflation and rates outlook towards an improving economic growth picture, which could trump near-term rate worries."
2024-04-10 07:32:31,"CPI Preview: The First ""Miss"" Of 2024?","The upcoming CPI report is pivotal for the Federal Reserve's rate decisions. A hot inflation print, which would be the third in a row, would seriously challenge market expectations for a June rate cut.

The analysis suggests that if the June cut is abandoned, any 2024 cuts become unlikely. A subsequent move in July or August would be viewed as too close to the November election, creating political pressure. This aligns with the logic that a ""data-dependent"" Fed would not cut rates if inflation is reaccelerating.

Should rate cuts be taken off the table for 2024, the article forecasts a potential ""collapse in risk assets,"" as the market may conclude the Fed will only ease policy if forced by a significant market crash."

2024-04-10 07:59:28,Futures On Edge Ahead Of Critical CPI Report,"Market focus is on the upcoming March CPI data, with economists forecasting a 0.3% monthly rise for both headline and core inflation. A higher figure could challenge the Federal Reserve's timeline for rate cuts, potentially delaying them until September.

Ahead of the release, the 10-year Treasury yield eased to 4.35%. Market sentiment reflects a 60% probability of a rate cut by June. However, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, a more hawkish FOMC member, reiterated his expectation for only one cut this year, not ruling out the possibility of no cuts at all.

Investors are also awaiting the March FOMC minutes and comments from Fed speakers for further clues on monetary policy, including potential changes to quantitative tightening (QT). A recent weak 3-year Treasury auction highlights sensitivity in the bond market."
2024-04-10 08:15:00,Inflation Has Become A Bigger Risk For Stretched Gold Prices,"The article analyzes US interest rates through the lens of gold prices, focusing on the real fed funds rate. The current real fed funds rate, deflated using CPI, stands at 2.3%.

According to the analysis, this is outside the historical ""sweet spot"" of -2% to +2% that typically correlates with the strongest returns for gold. This positioning makes the market more sensitive to inflation data. A weaker-than-expected CPI print would push real yields higher.

While the primary focus is on gold, the article indirectly comments on the rate outlook, suggesting that real yields are unlikely to deviate significantly from their optimal range in the medium term. This implies a relative stability in the balance between the Fed's policy rate and inflation."

Before the data, the swaps market was pricing in approximately 65 basis points of cuts by year-end, with some analysts predicting a 0.5% cut by June.

However, a stronger-than-expected inflation reading caused a significant market shift. Expectations for the first full quarter-point rate cut have now been pushed from September to November. The market is currently pricing in less than two 25-basis-point cuts for all of 2024.

Reflecting this change, swaps now price in just 3 basis points of cuts for the June FOMC meeting, a stark reversal from previous dovish sentiment. The large speculative trade itself resulted in an estimated $50 million loss."

This resurgence in inflation has dampened the Fed's hopes for substantial interest rate decreases.

Consequently, investor expectations have been revised downwards, from anticipating as many as six rate cuts at the beginning of the year to now forecasting only two. Despite the stubborn inflation, the Fed faces political pressure. President Biden publicly stated he still expects a rate cut before the year ends, highlighting the potential for political influence on the central bank's decisions ahead of the election."

The goal of the rate hikes was to tame inflation and avoid repeating the policy errors of the 1970s, where premature easing led to a second inflationary wave and rates as high as 15%.

Despite the Fed's efforts, the market appears to believe the battle against inflation has been lost. A new Goldman Sachs indicator suggests traders are positioning for a return of 1970s-style inflation, implying an expectation that a second, more dangerous inflationary wave is coming, which would challenge the Fed's current policy stance."

Investors are reportedly looking beyond the present 5% nominal and 2% real rates, which are seen as unsustainable. The recent surge in gold prices is interpreted as a hedge against two potential Federal Reserve scenarios: cutting rates even if inflation accelerates, or implementing Interest Cost Control (ICC) and Yield Curve Control (YCC). This suggests markets anticipate the Fed may be forced to restart QE to backstop government spending and prevent a financial crisis, signaling an end to the current hiking cycle."

2024-04-12 16:25:19,A new narrative emerging for gold,"The article analyzes the relationship between US interest rates and gold, suggesting a significant decoupling. Despite the Fed funds rate peaking at a 5.5% target, gold prices reached all-time highs in 2024. This price action contradicts the traditional theory that high rates suppress gold's value due to the increased opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding asset; investors could earn 5.5% on T-bills instead.

The speakers propose that gold may be entering a new era where its price is no longer tied to central bank rates. This shift is partly attributed to a loss of confidence in institutions, with one analyst cited describing the Fed as ""impotent and mistake-prone."" This perception is pushing investors toward safe-haven assets regardless of the current interest rate cycle, challenging long-held financial correlations."

This shift in expectation is attributed to reaccelerating inflation, which has been trending upwards for months.

The persistence of higher rates has significant fiscal implications. Interest payments on US debt, currently the second-largest government outlay at $1.1 trillion, are forecast to surpass Social Security. They are projected to become the single biggest US expense by the end of 2024, reaching an estimated $1.6 trillion. This highlights the economic pressure from the current interest rate environment as other inflationary concerns, like rising gasoline prices, also mount."

This hawkish shift comes as Treasury yields approach cycle highs; the 2-year yield rose 14 basis points and the 10-year rose 12 basis points on the week.

Stubborn inflation creates a dilemma for the Fed, which faces pressure to lower rates before a significant corporate debt maturity wall arrives in late 2024. If high inflation prevents rate cuts, it could risk financial stability in 2025. The high-yield environment has also pushed the equity risk premium over the 10-year Treasury to a 25-year low. The Fed may also discuss an early end to Quantitative Tightening (QT) amid funding market pressures."

The Fed’s tightening cycle is making refinancing difficult, particularly for the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) sector, where $929 billion in mortgages were maturing. This pressure is evident as the maturity payoff rate for office tower loans has dropped below 60%.

The residential market is also grappling with higher rates. New home prices have fallen 20% from their 2022 peak, returning to levels seen before the Fed began its hiking cycle in July 2021. The article suggests these rate-induced pressures on real estate pose increasing risks to the banking sector, especially regional banks, for 2025."

During this period of high inflation, the Volcker Fed aggressively tightened monetary policy.

The federal funds rate was raised from 10% in early 1979 to a peak of 20% in March 1980. This was in response to US CPI inflation which reached a high of 14.8% YoY in March 1980. Consequently, the ten-year Treasury bond yield peaked at 15.8% in September 1981.

This historical data is presented in the context of the gold market, suggesting a central bank’s interest in managing gold prices during periods of significant rate hikes. The article does not provide any new forecasts or information on current Fed policy."

The first is a ""soft landing,"" characterized by slowing GDP growth and inflation falling toward the Fed's 2% target. This outcome would likely support interest rate cuts.

The second scenario is a ""no landing,"" where economic growth re-accelerates and inflation remains sticky. This would pressure the Fed to maintain higher interest rates for a longer period, contrary to expectations for cuts.

The note suggests these outcomes have similar probabilities, highlighting significant uncertainty surrounding the future path of US rates and potential Fed decisions in 2024."

While a White House official claims the tariffs will not increase inflation, the author suggests they could create a negative supply shock.

This is presented in the context of broader monetary policy challenges. The piece explicitly states that inflation is ""reaccelerating"" and has not returned to ""Fed Powell's comfort zone of sub-2%."" This observation implies that persistent or rising inflation could complicate the Federal Reserve's future decisions regarding interest rates."
2024-04-17 07:45:00,Peter Schiff: The Data Looks Grim For The Dollar,"The article critiques the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy amid persistent inflation. Recent CPI data showed a 0.4% monthly increase, bringing year-over-year inflation to 3.5%, significantly above the Fed's 2% target.

Despite this data suggesting inflation is rising, the Fed is still reportedly considering rate cuts. The author argues this is a mistake, viewing rising gold prices as a signal that rates are too low. It is contended that the Fed should never have stopped hiking and that current conditions warrant aggressive action. Instead of cuts, the author advocates for sharp increases, suggesting ""200 basis point hikes"" are needed to properly address inflation. Continuing the current policy of considering cuts is described as inflationary and a potential catalyst for a future economic crisis."
2024-04-17 08:11:18,Futures Rebound After 3 Day Rout As Rates Drop From 2024 Highs,"Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that rate cuts will likely be delayed, stating recent data has not increased confidence in inflation's path toward the 2% target. He noted policy can remain restrictive ""as long as needed,"" a view echoed by Vice Chair Jefferson.

Consequently, market expectations for rate cuts have collapsed. After pricing as many as six cuts for 2024, traders now bet on two or fewer. Fed funds futures imply just 40bps of cuts by year-end. This hawkish recalibration pushed the 10-year Treasury yield to a five-month high of 4.67%, while the 2-year yield briefly surpassed 5% to close at 4.99%. The Fed’s upcoming Beige Book and comments from officials Mester and Bowman are now in focus."

The article highlights that future equity performance is heavily dependent on the direction of Treasury yields. A key risk factor identified is the two-year Treasury yield, which is approaching the 5% level. This threshold is described as historically ""scary"" for equities, suggesting that rising yields are a significant headwind for the market.

While there are no new Fed decisions mentioned, the focus on the 2-year and 10-year yields breaking through key risk levels indicates that current rate levels are creating significant market pressure."

2024-04-17 15:31:40,The US government shattered its own quarterly debt record,"Rising US government debt is forcing the Treasury to issue record amounts of bonds, pushing interest rates higher as investors demand greater returns for increased risk. Yields on 90-day T-bills have surged from approximately 0.5% to over 5% in two years.

The author argues the government cannot afford these high rates. Consequently, the Federal Reserve is expected to intervene by cutting interest rates to manage the government's financing costs. Despite rising inflation, the Fed has signaled it anticipates 2-3 rate cuts this year and has ruled out further hikes. The Fed Chairman noted rates may stay at current levels ""longer than expected"" but is seen as prioritizing government solvency over its inflation-fighting mandate. The reduction of its 'quantitative tightening' program is viewed as a first step towards future monetary easing."

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 3.5% year-over-year price increase for March, significantly above the Fed's 2% target.

The article argues that the Fed’s restrictive monetary policy is being undermined by the government's large deficit spending, which adds liquidity to the economy. This creates a conflict between the Fed’s efforts to slow the economy and expansionary fiscal policy. This contradiction complicates the fight against inflation.

Additionally, the high-interest-rate environment increases the federal deficit due to higher borrowing costs for the government. The author suggests that this economic backdrop of high inflation, despite the Fed's aggressive rate hikes, will likely persist."

The outlook is now highly uncertain, with some discussion of 2 potential rate hikes and a debate over whether high rates are paradoxically stimulating the economy. Reinforcing a hawkish stance, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated he is prepared to keep rates steady “as long as needed.” This contrasts with some contrarian calls for rate cuts to lower inflation by addressing housing supply issues. The evolving narrative highlights significant uncertainty surrounding the future path of US monetary policy."

The broad-based rise in commodity prices is described as ""bad news for Fed chair Powell's fight against the inflation monster."" This suggests that persistent commodity-driven inflation could complicate the central bank's efforts to control price levels. Such a development may influence the FED to maintain a more hawkish stance, potentially delaying or reducing the scope of any anticipated interest rate cuts in the near future."

2024-04-18 19:05:40,The halving is upon us,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that rate cuts are unlikely to happen soon due to persistent inflation. The central bank requires more time to gain confidence that inflation is stabilizing before considering any reductions. This hawkish shift has impacted ""risk-on"" assets and complicates efforts for a smooth economic landing.

Powell's decision to keep the federal funds rate unchanged is expected to exacerbate stress in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, as firms will face refinancing at higher interest rates, likely increasing loan delinquencies. Despite the Fed's cautious tone, President Biden suggested a rate cut this summer remains a possibility. The US Treasury is also reportedly attempting to auction new debt at lower yields while inflation runs hot."

This triggered a slump in US Treasury yields due to aggressive bidding for the safe-haven assets.

However, the article notes this reaction was temporary. Yields began to fade their initial drop as speculation grew that the attack was a measured response, leading to market normalization. The report does not contain specific yield figures, economic forecasts, or any discussion of Federal Reserve policy decisions."

2024-04-19 07:20:00,Hard Money Heat Check,"The article notes the current interest rate is 5.5%, creating an environment where a market sell-off could cause a scramble for liquidity. The author suggests these high rates, combined with a stretched consumer, may lead to a broader market crash and economic contraction.

A forecast from Peter Schiff is cited, claiming inflation will not return to the Fed's 2% target and could reach double digits by next year, implying rates may stay elevated. However, the author believes that if a market crash occurs, the Fed’s only response will be to print money, regardless of inflation levels. This suggests a potential pivot to easing measures in a crisis, which would likely cause a short-term drop in assets like gold before a subsequent recovery."

2024-04-19 08:05:09,"Futures Reverse All Losses, Oil Slides After Iran Plays Down Israeli Attacks, Signals No Retaliation","Recent hawkish Fedspeak and strong economic data have forced investors to revise expectations for US interest rate cuts. New York Fed President John Williams stated a rate hike is possible if warranted, while Atlanta’s Raphael Bostic sees no cuts until late 2024. Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari suggested rates could hold steady all year.

This sentiment follows resilient data, including jobless claims at 212k and a two-year high for the Philadelphia Fed business outlook. Consequently, the market has scaled back easing expectations, with OIS pricing implying just 41bp of cuts by year-end. US Treasury yields have reflected this, with the 2-year yield recently hitting 4.99% and the 10-year at 4.58%. While geopolitical news caused a brief flight to safety in bonds, the prevailing trend remains driven by the Fed’s higher-for-longer stance amid sticky inflation."
2024-04-19 08:20:00,Economic Warning From The NFIB,"The NFIB small business confidence survey has dropped to an 11-year low, signaling a potential recession. This pessimism is linked to the largest deviation of interest rates from their 5-year average since 1975. Higher borrowing costs and tighter bank lending standards are hurting small businesses, which lack access to bond markets.

In response to weak demand and high financing costs, business owners are cutting capital expenditures, hiring, and compensation plans. These economic warning signs, particularly from a sector that represents about half of the economy, may explain why the article suggests the Federal Reserve is becoming “more adamant about cutting rates.” The data points to a slowing economy, strengthening the case for future rate cuts by the Fed to provide stimulus."

2024-04-19 13:06:48,World War III Fear Boosts Gold & Oil on Bitcoin Halving Day,"Amid a ""nominally hot"" economy, the Federal Reserve has not ruled out further interest rate hikes. Consequently, investors now expect the Fed to hold rates higher for longer than previously anticipated.

This expectation is causing a bond sell-off, pushing yields to cycle highs. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen by 80 basis points, and the 2-year yield has increased by 76 basis points.

While the current outlook is for higher rates, the article notes that escalating geopolitical conflict could force the US Treasury to ramp up debt issuance. This might eventually pressure the Fed to reverse its policy, introducing rate cuts and direct US Treasury buying to support the market."
2024-04-19 17:27:39,Why gold is shrugging off rates AND inflation,"The article discusses the current inflationary environment, noting the official 3% CPI is well below the perceived real rate of 8-10%. This marks a significant change from the preceding 40-year period (1982-2022) of declining interest rates. While skeptical of the Fed's absolute control, the speaker acknowledges its influence on rates.

Previously, low rates pushed investors towards riskier equities to find yield. With current higher rates, investors are now more conservative, seeking 5-7% returns to preserve capital. However, this may still result in negative real returns given high inflation. The speaker criticizes the Federal Reserve's policies, arguing they have been poor stewards of the dollar, leading to monetary dysfunction and eroding savings. The discussion suggests a prolonged period of stubborn inflation, forcing a readjustment in financial strategies."

It claims that while the Fed raised rates, the intended effect of cooling the housing market did not materialize.

The primary reason cited is that large corporate buyers, which accounted for 27% of family home purchases in 2023, are supported by the central bank and remain unaffected by higher borrowing costs. This has prevented the rate hikes from curbing housing demand from major investors, thus failing to improve affordability for the general population.

Goolsbee noted that after three months of disappointing inflation data, the trend ""can’t be dismissed.""

Consequently, market expectations for rate cuts in 2024 and 2025 have plunged. This sentiment shift was reflected in the bond market, with Treasury yields rising by approximately 8-10 basis points for the week. The 2-year Treasury yield is testing the key 5.00% level, indicating the market is pricing in a higher-for-longer rate environment. Upcoming GDP and PCE inflation reports are key for future Fed policy."

FED’s Williams reinforced this, noting that while rate hikes are not the baseline, they are ""possible if the data warrants.""

This stance contrasts with Wall Street consensus, which still forecasts more than one cut in 2024, with an 88% probability of a first cut in September.

Persistent inflation and strong labor data have pushed back earlier expectations of a June rate cut. The FED may now leverage a strengthening USD and rising 10-year yields to tighten financial conditions indirectly. This policy divergence is notable as other central banks, like the ECB, are signaling imminent rate reductions."

2024-04-22 07:20:00,When Will The Yen Carry Trade End?,"The end of Japan's negative interest rate policy could significantly impact US rates. The unwinding of the ""$20 trillion yen carry trade""—where investors borrow yen to buy higher-yielding US assets—poses a key risk. If the Bank of Japan sells its US Treasury holdings to support the yen, it could push US bond yields and interest payments higher.

However, the article also notes that US rate cuts are ""still on the table"" for this year. Such cuts by the Fed would narrow the interest rate differential between the US and Japan, further eroding the carry trade's viability. This creates a complex outlook, with potential for both upward pressure on US yields from Japanese actions and downward pressure from anticipated Fed policy."

Strong economic data has forced a ""reset"" on the timing of the first rate cut, with investors now pricing in only 39bps of cuts for the year. The Fed’s own Financial Stability Report cited higher-than-expected rates and persistent inflation as the biggest threats.

Focus now shifts to key upcoming data, including the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core PCE deflator, which is forecast to rise 0.30% monthly. In response to shifting expectations, Treasury yields have climbed. The 10-year yield rose to approximately 4.66%, reflecting the market's growing skepticism about imminent rate cuts."

Despite bond yields soaring from around 4% at the start of the year to a recent 4.65%, the stock market has remained resilient, with the S&P 500 surging significantly.

This initially spurred a Treasury rally, with the 2-year yield falling to 4.93%. However, yields later rose 3-4bps across the curve, with the 10-year yield settling around 4.64%, partly due to a global bond selloff. A $70 billion 5-year note auction is scheduled with a yield near 4.655%. Fed officials are now in a quiet period ahead of their May 1 policy meeting, so no further guidance is expected."

While the article does not provide specific numerical forecasts for future rates, it explicitly states that the market's perception of the Fed's path for interest rate cuts is a primary driver of current asset pricing. The text suggests these rate-related factors are causing short-term headwinds for certain investments, even if the long-term outlook for them remains positive."

With the national debt approaching $35 trillion and projected to grow by over $20 trillion in the next decade, the US faces a significant challenge. Tens of trillions of dollars in existing debt must be refinanced over the next 5-7 years at what the author states will be higher interest rates.

This will cause interest payments on the national debt to surge. For the first time in US history, interest payments are projected to exceed defense spending this year, a trend expected to continue rising. The author uses this fiscal outlook to argue for holding assets like gold."

2024-04-26 07:00:00,The US Economy is on The Cusp of Stagflation,"Recent economic data points to potential stagflation, significantly altering US interest rate expectations. Q1 GDP growth slowed to 1.6%, well below the 3.4% prior, while quarterly core PCE inflation accelerated from 2.0% to 3.7%.

This combination has caused markets to price in higher-for-longer rates from the Federal Reserve. Following the data, 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields both spiked 8 basis points.

Consequently, expectations for Fed rate cuts have collapsed. In January, markets priced in over six cuts for 2024; that forecast has now shrunk to just one potential cut by December. The prospect of any cuts by June has been eliminated. While the Fed is expected to hold rates firm in the near term, the article suggests eventual rate cuts are inevitable once the economy shows significant strain."

A hotter-than-expected reading, following recent weak GDP and strong Q1 core PCE (+3.7%), could signal that US rates will remain higher for longer.

Recent stagflationary data has already pushed back expectations for policy easing. The market now prices only 34bps of cuts by the December meeting, with the first full 25bp cut not anticipated until December 2024. In response, Treasury yields surged to 2024 highs, with the 2-year yield climbing 7.1bps to nearly 5% (4.998%) and the 10-year yield hitting 4.70%. The Fed is in a quiet period ahead of its May 1 policy announcement."
2024-04-26 08:25:00,China Is Pivotal For US Inflation's Path,"US inflation is proving more stubborn than expected, with analysis suggesting Fed policy has had only a marginal impact on bringing it down. According to the San Francisco Fed, most of the recent disinflation has been driven by acyclical components, which are highly correlated to China's producer prices.

The article warns that if China responds to its economic slowdown with broad stimulus, as it has historically, it would significantly boost US inflation. This would create further upward pressure on the US term premium and long-term yields, complicating the Federal Reserve's efforts to manage price stability. The PCE release is noted as having upside risks, reinforcing the view of persistent inflation."
2024-04-26 08:39:04,Fed's Favorite Inflation Indicator Prints Hotter-Than-Expected As Savings Rate Plunges,"Recent inflation data has dampened hopes for imminent Federal Reserve rate cuts. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Core PCE Deflator, remained stubbornly high at +2.8% year-over-year, exceeding expectations. The headline PCE also rose to +2.7% YoY.

More concerning for policymakers, the 3-month annualized core PCE surged to 4.4%, driven by persistent services inflation. Strong consumer spending, which rose 0.8% month-over-month, and a declining personal savings rate (down to 3.2%) further complicate the Fed's path. This persistent inflationary pressure significantly reduces the probability of the Fed implementing rate cuts in the near future, raising questions about whether any cuts will occur in 2024."

This rise in energy costs, with US gasoline prices approaching $4/gallon, is contributing to mounting stagflation concerns.

While the article highlights that higher fuel costs are driving inflation, a key factor for monetary policy, it does not explicitly mention the Federal Reserve, interest rates, or any potential policy decisions. The focus remains on the geopolitical drivers of inflation and its political implications rather than the direct impact on US rates."
2024-04-26 08:56:48,"Bond Market About To Have An ""Aneurism""","Investor Harris Kupperman forecasts a potential US bond market crisis driven by escalating fiscal deficits. He argues this situation will force the Federal Reserve to pivot its policy.

In this scenario, the Fed would be compelled to intervene in the yield curve, buying long-dated bonds with printed money to fund government spending—a policy dubbed ""Project Zimbabwe."" This action would prioritize stabilizing the bond market over the health of the economy or the jobs market.

While this crisis could cause a short-term market dip, the author believes the subsequent monetary expansion would lead to an explosion in inflation-linked asset prices. He views this forced pivot by the Central Bank as increasingly imminent, driven by the government's inability to fund its spending."

US interest rates are currently at their highest level in decades, a direct result of the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening cycle last year. This ""yawning gap"" between high US rates and Japan's near-zero borrowing costs is identified as the primary driver for the yen's depreciation against the dollar.

The piece also notes that upcoming US economic data, specifically the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, will be a key factor influencing short-term market dynamics. This suggests that market participants are closely watching US inflation indicators for clues about the Federal Reserve's future policy path."

Higher rates have exacerbated unrealized losses on banks' bond portfolios, which totaled nearly $400 billion across the US system at the end of 2023.

The article questions the market's assumption that the Federal Reserve will implement significant rate cuts this year. This uncertainty, coupled with the recent expiration of the Fed's Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), suggests continued vulnerability. The piece notes that alleged Fed cuts and the end of Quantitative Tightening (QT) were anticipated for March, but the persistence of high rates and banking fragility casts doubt on the timing and scale of future monetary easing."

Commentators express alarm over the bond market. Veteran trader Jack Boroudjian warns of a specific bond yield level that could trigger ""serious earthquakes"" in the economy. Another investor, Harris Kupperman, predicts the bond market will have an ""aneurism"" and wrest control from the Treasury.

These monetary policy challenges are exacerbated by fiscal pressures, including debt accumulation at a rate of $1 trillion per 100 days, which could further influence bond yields and the Fed's path forward."

The yield recently hit 4.7%, its highest since November, as persistent inflation forces the Federal Reserve and Treasury to act.

This trend creates a dilemma for the Fed. Rising yields, driven by bond traders selling bonds, pressure the central bank to fight inflation and make rate cuts less likely. However, higher rates threaten to destabilize debt-dependent sectors like automotive and commercial real estate.

Experts suggest the ""danger zone"" for the 10-year yield is between 5% and 5.5%. Reaching this level could trigger significant economic instability, as the Fed is caught between combating inflation and preventing a market crash caused by high borrowing costs."

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to reiterate that borrowing costs will remain high for longer, citing a lack of progress on inflation and a strong labor market. Recent PCE data, with headline inflation at 2.7% YoY, has reinforced this view. Consequently, market expectations for rate cuts have diminished, with only 34bps of cuts priced in by December.

On Monday, 10-year Treasury yields fell four basis points to 4.62% ahead of the Treasury's quarterly refunding announcement. This follows a week where yields reached their highest close of the year. Key upcoming data, including the April jobs report (forecast +240k), will be critical for the Fed's future policy decisions. Fed members are in a quiet period before the May 1 policy announcement."

Kostin argues that a lack of rate cuts is not necessarily a major headwind for stocks. He highlights that despite climbing rates and diminished expectations for cuts, the S&P 500 has still returned 6% this year. This suggests that the market can absorb a more hawkish Fed stance than previously anticipated. While no specific new forecast for rates is given, the analysis indicates that strong equity performance is possible even if the Federal Reserve delays or reduces its planned interest rate cuts."

This environment of high inflation and a weak economy creates a major challenge for the Fed. The analysis suggests the central bank will be reluctant to raise interest rates to combat inflation, as doing so would risk further damaging economic growth. This predicament implies the Fed may be unable to use rate hikes effectively, potentially allowing inflation to persist while the economy struggles. A falling consumer savings rate, now at 3.2%, further highlights the economic strain on consumers."
