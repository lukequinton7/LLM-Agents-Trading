The US interest expense on debt has risen to a record $1.1 trillion in late March, up from $1 trillion in late 2023. This increase is attributed to rising US debt, which is growing at a pace of $1 trillion every 3 months. BofA CIO Michael Hartnett notes that this surge in interest expense is a ""big motivation"" for the Fed to cut rates to constrain the rise in interest costs."

2024-03-31 19:17:07,Bazooka Xi: Why Gold and Stocks Both Rally Now,"Here is a summary of the article related to US interest rates, within the 150-word limit:

The article discusses potential monetary easing by China, which could impact global markets. Goldman Sachs reported that President Xi ordered the PBOC to inject liquidity into the economy via buying central government bonds (CGB). This indirect QE would guide long-term CGB yields down further and weaken the Yuan. The author suggests that this move is a catalyst for accelerating gold prices and commodity rallies, which are already happening despite no data suggesting US Fed easing in June.

The article does not provide specific information on US interest rates or FED decisions. However, it implies that China's potential monetary policy change could have implications for global markets, including the US."

2024-04-01 07:20:00,"Spending, Income, And Inflation Data Do Not Support Fed Interest Rate Cuts","Here is a summary of the article's key points related to US interest rates:

The recent BEA report on Personal Income and Outlays for February 2024 suggests that the Fed should not cut interest rates at its next meeting. The PCE price index increased by 0.333% month-over-month, which translates to around 4.0% annual inflation rate if continued. This is higher than the Fed's target of 2.0%. The market expects a rate cut in June, but the data does not support it. The author concludes that unless the data is ""very hot"", the Fed will likely cut interest rates as expected by the market."
2024-04-01 08:30:16,Are You Ready For the Second Wave of Inflation?,"Here is a summary of the article's key points related to US interest rates and FED decisions, within the 150-word limit:

The article argues that the Federal Reserve (Fed) is not politically independent but rather leans left. The Fed's actions are cited as evidence of this claim, including:

* Launching QE3 before the 2012 Presidential election
* Keeping rates at zero for seven years under President Obama and raising them only twice in 2015-2016
* Raising rates three to four times per year after Trump's election while draining liquidity from the financial system
* Currently juicing the stock market via credit facilities to aid the Biden administration and promising rate cuts despite inflation not reaching its 2% target.

The article also mentions that the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index rose 6% in January, which is up from 5.6% in December 2023."

2024-04-01 17:19:40,How We Can Fix Our Money,"This is a lengthy and detailed article on the author's proposal for a new economic system, which they call ""economic democracy."" The system aims to address the fundamental problem of the current economic system, which is the ""gap"" between the cost of production (A + B) and the price at which goods and services are sold. This gap leads to poverty, inequality, and unemployment.

The author proposes two main solutions:

1. **National Dividend**: A guaranteed income for every citizen from the age of 18 to death, funded by the national credit office. The dividend would be $2000/month, and it would eliminate the need for welfare and social security programs.
2. **Compensated Price Mechanism**: A system where businesses are rewarded with a sales credit when they sell their goods and services at a price that is higher than their production costs (A + B). This would incentivize businesses to produce high-quality products and reduce waste.

The author also proposes the use of blockchain technology to create an immutable and incorruptible ledger for tracking transactions and ensuring the accuracy of the accounting system. They suggest using open-source software and Git to house the code that implements the system, which would prevent fraud and corruption.

The article outlines several key features of the proposed economic system:

* **Incorruptibility**: The use of blockchain technology ensures that the system is tamper-proof and transparent.
* **Fairness**: Everyone receives a guaranteed income (national dividend) and has access to credit, regardless of their employment status.
* **Efficiency**: Businesses are incentivized to produce high-quality products and reduce waste through the compensated price mechanism.
* **Sustainability**: The system promotes sustainable consumption patterns and reduces pollution.

The author also discusses the potential benefits of this new economic system, including:

* Reduced poverty and inequality
* Increased productivity and efficiency
* Improved quality of life for citizens
* Reduced unemployment and increased job satisfaction

Overall, the article presents a comprehensive proposal for a new economic system that addresses the fundamental problems of the current system. While it is a complex and ambitious plan, it has the potential to create a more equitable and sustainable economy."

The growing national debt puts pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low. The Fed's rate increases have contributed to a 32% rise in national debt payments since last year. The CBO estimates that by 2051, interest on the debt will exceed military spending and become the largest item in the federal budget. This will erode the dollar's purchasing power and lead to inflation. The Federal Reserve's need to keep rates low may cause a major economic meltdown, leading to civil unrest and restrictions on liberty."

2024-04-04 13:54:37,Gold Is on the Rise and Reaches All-Time High,"Here are the key points related to gold and silver prices:

**Gold Price**

* Central banks and sovereigns buying gold is the primary driver for a higher gold price.
* Gold prices have been influenced by central bank and sovereign buying, which has maintained its correlation with gold's monetary value.
* The Shanghai gold price premium is trending higher, indicating continued support from China.

**Silver Price**

* Silver has lagged behind gold due to lack of central bank and sovereign buying, but its correlation with gold remains intact.
* Silver prices are expected to be drawn upward in tandem with gold due to its continuing alignment with gold's monetary value.
* The reflation trade is likely to benefit commodities like copper and silver, which have similar economic correlations.

**Silver Demand**

* Solar power generation is driving demand for silver, particularly with the transition to more silver-intensive technologies.
* Silver inventory and production dynamics are poised to play a significant role in the silver market.
* A potentially dwindling free float of silver, steady demand from traditional sectors, and escalating requirements from the solar energy industry will impact silver prices.

**Reflation Trade**

* Global central banks (ex-Bank of Japan) are entering a synchronized easing cycle, which is likely to benefit the reflation trade.
* Commodities like copper and silver may perform well as high beta plays of this reflation trade.

Overall, the report suggests that gold and silver prices will continue to be influenced by central bank and sovereign buying, as well as the reflation trade."

The article discusses the upcoming employment data release and its potential impact on interest rates. The rate of payroll growth is expected to cool in March, which may not be enough to prompt a rate cut from the Fed. Chair Powell stated that an unexpected deterioration in the labor market would be needed for a rate cut, but he does not see this scenario unfolding. However, there are concerns about inflation and potential pressure on the Fed to lower rates, particularly with Biden facing pushback from the radical left."

The article notes that real yields in the US have reached 2%, their highest level in 15 years. This would normally be expected to negatively impact gold prices, but instead, gold has surged to record highs despite elevated real yields. The author suggests that this could indicate one of two outcomes: either gold will rapidly reverse its recent gains or risk assets are due for a collapse due to an economic/financial crisis."

The author suggests that despite a ""strong"" unemployment report, interest rates may remain higher for longer than expected. The chart shows that the peak in short-term interest rates (3-month T-bill rate) came a year after the peak in inflation during the 1980-1982 recessions. This implies that the Fed may continue to keep rates high to combat inflation. No specific numerical values are mentioned, but the author's implication is that rates will remain elevated for an extended period."

The article discusses the European sovereign debt crisis and its potential impact on the global economy. It mentions that the ECB has adopted a more dovish stance compared to the FED, with Lagarde indicating that the first interest rate reduction will come in June. This view is widely endorsed by many members of the Governing Council.

However, there are no specific references to US interest rates or FED decisions beyond this mention of the ECB's dovish stance and potential rate cut in June. The article primarily focuses on the European economy and its challenges.

2024-04-06 23:20:00,America Is Hurtling Toward A Full-Blown Hot Civil War,"The article is a scathing critique of the current state of America, which the author believes is on the brink of collapse due to the actions of the Biden administration and the Democratic Party. The author argues that the country has been infiltrated by communists, radical leftists, and other enemies who seek to destroy traditional American values and institutions.

The article highlights several key issues, including:

1. **Economic collapse**: The author believes that the massive national debt and out-of-control spending will lead to economic catastrophe.
2. **Energy crisis**: The Biden administration's efforts to restrict energy production and exports will lead to a shortage of electricity, fossil fuels, and heat, causing widespread suffering.
3. **Immigration crisis**: The influx of illegal aliens from unfriendly countries will lead to chaos and violence in America.
4. **Corruption of institutions**: The author argues that every government institution has been corrupted by the infiltration of communists and other enemies of America.
5. **Loss of individual freedoms**: The Biden administration's efforts to impose a digital currency, restrict energy production, and control people's lives will lead to a loss of individual freedoms.

The article also highlights the role of key figures in the Democratic Party, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Chuck Schumer, who are accused of promoting communist ideology and undermining American values.

The author concludes that America is on the brink of a hot civil war between those who support communism and tyranny (the Democrats) and those who support freedom and liberty (conservatives and independents). The article ends with a call to action for patriots to rise up and defend their country against these enemies-from-within and foreign enemies supported by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations.

Overall, the article is a dire warning about the state of America and the need for patriots to take action to preserve freedom and liberty."

2024-04-07 23:20:00,"What's So Great About The Great Reset, Great Taking, Great Replacement, Great Deflation, & Next Great Depression?","This is a lengthy and detailed article that presents a conspiracy theory about a supposed plan by powerful individuals to collapse the global financial system and impose a totalitarian regime on humanity. The author, who has read David Webb's book ""The Great Taking,"" presents a comprehensive overview of the alleged plan, which includes:

1.  **Financial Collapse**: The author believes that the current debt growth is unsustainable and will lead to a massive financial collapse.
2.  **Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)**: The author claims that CBDCs are being introduced as a means to control people's finances and impose a new form of slavery.
3.  **The Great Reset**: The author believes that the ""Great Reset"" is an anti-human plan to introduce a techno-feudalistic system, built upon fear, scarcity, surveillance, and threats of violence for non-compliance.
4.  **Debt as a Tool of Conquest**: The author argues that debt will be used as a powerful weapon of conquest, allowing the ruling elite to take control of people's property and businesses.

The author also presents some arguments against the plan, including:

1.  **False Hope**: The author believes that non-violent means may not be enough to defeat the power-hungry individuals behind this plan.
2.  **Losing Control**: The author suggests that the ruling elite are losing control, resulting in an acceleration of their plans and mistakes on their part.

The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of awakening people from their ""normalcy stupor"" and resisting the alleged plan through non-violent means.

**Key Points:**

*   The author believes that a financial collapse is imminent due to unsustainable debt growth.
*   Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is being introduced as a means to control people's finances and impose a new form of slavery.
*   The ""Great Reset"" is an anti-human plan to introduce a techno-feudalistic system, built upon fear, scarcity, surveillance, and threats of violence for non-compliance.
*   Debt will be used as a powerful weapon of conquest, allowing the ruling elite to take control of people's property and businesses.

**Critical Thinking:**

While the article presents some compelling arguments, it is essential to approach this topic with a critical eye. Some points to consider:

1.  **Lack of concrete evidence**: The author relies heavily on David Webb's book as the primary source of information.
2.  **Conspiracy theory**: The article presents a conspiracy theory that may not be supported by empirical evidence.
3.  **Overemphasis on fear**: The article focuses primarily on the negative aspects of the alleged plan, which may create unnecessary fear and anxiety.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Seek multiple sources**: Verify information through reputable sources to ensure accuracy.
2.  **Evaluate evidence critically**: Consider the strength of evidence presented in support of the conspiracy theory.
3.  **Focus on solutions**: Instead of dwelling on the negative aspects, explore potential solutions and ways to prepare for any potential financial collapse.

By approaching this topic with a critical eye and considering multiple perspectives, individuals can make informed decisions about their financial security and well-being."

The Treasury market is anticipating higher yields due to rising inflation expectations, with bond traders doubting the Fed can meet its 2% inflation target. Two-year breakeven rates have climbed to ~30bps under February CPI, suggesting doubts about the Fed's ability to deliver six rate cuts by end of next year.

* Former Fed St. Louis President James Bullard said that three reductions remain ""the base case"".
* The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.42%, the highest closing level of 2024 so far.
* The 2-year Treasury yield rose to 4.79%.
* Chicago Fed President Goolsbee noted that if rates stay high, the unemployment rate will start going up.
* Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari said that labor is still tight, but his base case is that inflation will continue to fall.

Overall, market expectations for US interest rates have shifted towards fewer rate cuts this year."
2024-04-09 08:25:00,"In The Next Several Weeks, We Could See $300 Billion Of Liquidity Leaving The System","Here is a summary of the article's key points related to US interest rates:

The article discusses the potential for a significant contraction in liquidity in the next few weeks, which could lead to a larger drawdown in the stock market. The main drivers of this contraction are:

* $300 billion of liquidity leaving the system due to tax deadline and Treasury bill issuance
* $250 billion of liquidity drain from quantitative tightening (QT)
* Expiration of emergency bank lending facility (BTFP loans) causing another contraction in bank reserves

The article also notes that the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasuries has moved from 3.78% to 4.40% since December, indicating rising bond yields.

Overall, the article suggests that a significant contraction in liquidity could lead to higher volatility and potentially lower stock prices."

The author argues that these policies have led to manipulated lower interest rates, allowing governments to borrow at cheaper rates despite ballooning debts and deficits. The new SLR rule change could allow banks to be an endless buyer of treasury debt, which is convenient for them but raises concerns about the safety of government bonds as collateral.

Market strategists expect rate cuts this year, despite inflation worries. HSBC and JPMorgan believe that any setback in market momentum will be temporary. The Fed's cautious comments on inflation have raised concerns about the rate outlook. However, JPMorgan expects a cooler CPI print to boost risk assets. Market positioning is supportive, with hedge funds selling stocks for several weeks. Inflation expectations are strengthening, but the market hasn't been complacent. The global economy continues to improve, supporting equities despite tightening financial conditions.

2024-04-10 07:32:31,"CPI Preview: The First ""Miss"" Of 2024?","Here is a summary of the article's key points related to US interest rates:

The article suggests that a hot CPI print tomorrow would make it unlikely for the FED to cut interest rates in June, and potentially even in 2024. This is because a rate cut so close to the November elections could be seen as politically motivated and prompt outrage from Trump and Republicans. The market expects a rate cut to be taken off the table, which could lead to a collapse in risk assets if it realizes that the FED will not move unless there's a market crash."

* Economists forecast headline CPI to be at a monthly +0.27%, with the year-on-year measure picking up two-tenths to +3.4%.
* For core CPI, they're forecasting a monthly +0.24%, with the year-on-year measure declining to +3.7%.
* The probability of a Fed rate cut by June moved up to 60% ahead of the report.
* A hot number in the CPI could ""put pressure on the Fed to reconsider their interest rate path"" and make it increasingly difficult to explain strong readings as just a temporary blip.

Overall, the market is expecting a moderate increase in inflation, which could have implications for future interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve."

The FED's real fed funds rate has been around 2.3%, which is near its ""sweet spot"" for gold returns (between -2% and +2%). However, if inflation data comes in softer than expected today, it could trigger a selloff in gold due to its heightened sensitivity to CPI at this point in the cycle. The author notes that real yields are unlikely to deviate far from their sweet spot in the medium term, suggesting any dips in gold are unlikely to last long."

The market initially reacted to a large block trade in December 2024 SOFR futures, pricing in approximately 65 basis points of Fed rate cuts by year-end. However, after a stronger-than-expected CPI print, expectations for rate cuts shifted and the market now prices in less than two 25 basis-point moves for all of 2024. The swaps market is now pricing in just 3 basis points of cuts for the June FOMC meeting, down from State Street's predicted half-point cut. This suggests a potential delay in Fed rate cuts, with November now seen as the likely time for the first full quarter-point rate cut this year."

The article suggests that hotter consumer prices in the US may complicate matters for the Fed and potentially postpone the first interest rate cut to the second half of the year. Implied interest rate swaps show less than two cuts are being priced in for the year, down from 7 in early January. This implies a higher-for-longer scenario, which could delay recovery in used luxury watch prices or send them even lower. The article also mentions that soaring borrowing rates have hammered demand for watches, purses, and jewelry over the last two years."

* Investors now expect only two rate cuts this year, down from as high as six at the beginning of the year.
* President Biden has predicted that there will be a rate cut before the end of the year, despite stubbornly high inflation.
* The upcoming bitcoin halving is expected to result in a modest decrease in hash rate of between 3% and 10%, but analysts predict a surge in bitcoin's post-halving dollar exchange rate, with Bitfinex forecasting a 160% increase targeting a range of $150,000 to $169,000."

However, the market believes that this effort may be too little, too late and that a second wave of inflation is imminent. A new basket introduced by Goldman Sachs suggests that traders are betting on a return to high inflation, similar to the 1970s. This implies that interest rates may need to rise even further in the near future to combat inflationary pressures."

The article discusses the surge in gold prices, which some analysts believe may be a sign that something big is about to break in the financial markets. BofA CIO Michael Hartnett notes that investors are hedging against the risk of the Fed cutting interest rates as CPI accelerates and the ""endgame"" of Fed Interest Cost Control (ICC) and Yield Curve Control (YCC). If gold prices continue to rise, it could lead to a spike in yields, prompting the Fed to implement QE or YCC. BofA commodities strategist Michael Widmer predicts that gold will rally to $3,000/oz by 2025, while UBS predicts it could double from here to over $4,000.

Key points:

* Interest on US debt is set to surpass Social Security spending and become the single largest government outlay before the end of 2024.
* The Fed's interest rate decisions are being closely watched, with some analysts predicting a potential cut in rates as CPI accelerates.
* Gold prices have surged, potentially signaling a shift in market sentiment and a warning shot for investors.
* BofA predicts gold will rally to $3,000/oz by 2025, while UBS predicts it could double from here to over $4,000."

2024-04-12 16:25:19,A new narrative emerging for gold,"This is a long-form conversation between Ben Johnson and John Hathaway (of Sprott) about the role of gold in the global monetary system, its value as a safe haven asset, and its potential to regain some of its former importance as a financial asset. Here are the key points discussed:

**The Safe Haven Narrative**

* The idea that gold is a safe haven asset is gaining traction, especially among investors who are concerned about the stability of the US dollar.
* This narrative doesn't require catastrophic predictions or doomsday scenarios; it's simply about being prepared for potential economic shocks and preserving wealth.
* Gold can appreciate in value even if there isn't an immediate crisis, as its price can rise due to a long-term trend of increasing demand or decreasing supply.

**The Inflation Hedge vs. Safe Haven**

* The inflation hedge narrative is not entirely accurate, as gold's price doesn't always correlate perfectly with inflation.
* However, the safe haven narrative is stronger because it's based on human psychology and behavior, rather than just economic data.
* Gold can appreciate in value even if there isn't an immediate crisis, as its price can rise due to a long-term trend of increasing demand or decreasing supply.

**The Role of Central Banks**

* Central banks are unlikely to return to a gold standard anytime soon, but they do hold gold as a reserve asset and recognize its monetary value.
* The premium that the market sets for gold's monetary use above its commodity uses is evidence of its continued importance in the global financial system.

**Gold vs. Bitcoin**

* The competition between gold and Bitcoin is becoming increasingly intense, with both assets vying for attention from investors.
* However, gold still has a significant advantage due to its established track record, liquidity, and monetary value.

**Conclusion**

* Gold's price of $2,300 per ounce reflects its continued importance as a financial asset, even if it's not being used as a medium of exchange or a unit of account.
* The safe haven narrative is gaining traction, and gold can appreciate in value even without an immediate crisis.
* Ultimately, gold remains a valuable asset for investors who want to preserve wealth and protect themselves from potential economic shocks."

* 2s and 10s fell 6 basis points to close Friday, but rose 14bps and 12bps respectively for the week.
* Treasury yields are still expected to reach cycle highs.

**FED Decisions:**

* Fed members walked back rate cut expectations for 2024, with some calling for one or none.
* This is a change from their previous tone over the last six months.
* The FED's ability to bring down price inflation before the late-2024 corporate debt maturity wall approaches will be crucial.

**Inflation Expectations:**

* Inflation expectations on the 1-year and 5-10 year horizons came in higher than expected, suggesting price inflation will remain elevated for several months.
* Consumer sentiment remains at a 3-year high, largely due to elevated stock prices."

2024-04-14 00:32:17,The Real Estate Slow Burn...,"Here is a summary of the article's key points related to US interest rates:

The Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle is expected to endure, suggesting that challenges are approaching, possibly after the presidential election. The high amount of debt in commercial real estate (CRE) has been extended and modified instead of refinanced, helping to mitigate potential defaults. However, stresses are mounting in the office segment, with a low likelihood of funding costs returning to pre-COVID levels raising concerns about sustainability. Modifications will likely persist due to uneconomical refinancing for most CRE borrowers and lenders' reluctance to pursue foreclosures.

The increasing delinquency rates in the office market will have a harsh impact on regional commercial banks, which hold over 65% of CRE loans. A recent study suggests that up to 385 American banks could fail solely due to commercial real estate loans. The ""higher-for-longer"" theme suggests increasing risks in the CRE space for 2025.

The article also mentions that new home prices have declined by 20% from their peak, returning to levels seen before the Federal Reserve initiated its latest interest rate hike cycle in July 2021. Historically, lower home prices have rarely been good news for the performance of the US banking sector."

The article discusses the ECB's possible interest rate cut in June, but notes that it may be premature and wrong. It highlights that inflation remains persistent and above the 2% target, and that the underlying trend suggests a higher inflation level than the ECB's target. The author argues that negative real interest rates have been destructive and encouraged excessive risk-taking. In contrast to the ECB, the article does not mention any specific FED decisions or forecasts related to US interest rates."

The article mentions that Morgan Stanley's net interest income fell in Q1 2024, driven by changes in deposit mix. However, this decline was partially offset by the impact of interest rates. The bank's CEO mentioned that the firm has reached $7 trillion of client assets across Wealth and Investment Management. There is no specific mention of FED decisions or forecasts on US interest rates."

No relevant content. However, there are some indirect mentions of inflation and its impact on the economy. The article states that inflation is reaccelerating, contrary to expectations, and that higher tariffs can spark inflation and drive a negative supply shock. Additionally, it mentions that President Biden's actions may not increase inflation, but this statement is made by an administration official and lacks concrete evidence or data. There are no specific references to interest rates, FED decisions, forecasts, yields, or any other economic indicators related to US rates."
2024-04-17 07:45:00,Peter Schiff: The Data Looks Grim For The Dollar,"Here is a summary of the article's key points related to US interest rates:

The article discusses the rising gold price as a signal that interest rates are too low and need to be increased. The author argues that the Fed's rate cuts were a mistake, and that rates should have been hiked instead. The CPI report showed a 0.4% increase from last month, with year-over-year inflation at 3.5%, far above the Fed's 2% target. Despite this, the Fed is still expecting to cut rates. The author believes that the rising gold price will eventually lead to a stampede into gold by foreign central banks and investors, which will further weaken the dollar."
2024-04-17 08:11:18,Futures Rebound After 3 Day Rout As Rates Drop From 2024 Highs,"Here's a summary of the key points from the article:

**Global Markets**

* Global markets experienced a selloff on both sides of the Atlantic due to concerns about higher-for-longer interest rates and inflation.
* The STOXX 600 fell by 1.53%, its worst performance in 9 months, while the S&P 500 fell by 0.21%.
* US high yield spreads widened for the fourth session in a row, the longest such run since January.

**Fed and Interest Rates**

* Fed Vice Chair Jefferson stated that if incoming data suggest inflation is more persistent than expected, it will be appropriate to hold in place the current restrictive stance of policy for longer.
* Fed Chair Powell echoed these comments, saying that it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve confidence in the path of inflation.
* As a result, investors priced in only 40bps of cuts by year-end, the lowest this has been so far in this cycle.

**ECB and European Markets**

* ECB President Lagarde confirmed that the ECB is moving closer towards a rate cut, but noted that they need to pay attention to changes in exchange rates.
* Investors slightly dialled back the chance of a June cut, which fell from 90% to 87%.
* Sovereign bonds sold off across Europe, with yields on 10yr bunds, OATs, and BTPs all experiencing fresh losses.

**Energy Prices**

* Natural gas prices rose another +6.53% to €33.45/MWh, well off the recent lows of €25.80/MWh on April 3.
* Oil prices saw some stabilisation, with Brent Crude down a marginal -0.09% to $90.02 yesterday.

**Equities**

* Equities experienced a fresh selloff on both sides of the Atlantic due to concerns about higher-for-longer interest rates and inflation.
* The S&P 500 only fell by 0.21%, but this was still a broad decline, with banks underperforming within the index.

**Data Releases**

* Japan's exports grew +7.3% y/y in March, while imports fell -4.9% y/y.
* US industrial production was in line with expectations, showing +0.4% growth in March.
* The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model for Q1 is pointing to an annualised growth rate of 2.9%, up a tenth relative to the previous day.

**IMF World Economic Outlook**

* The IMF upgraded their global growth forecast for 2024 by a tenth relative to January, and now see growth of +3.2% this year.
* They also upgraded their US growth forecast to +2.7%, while downgrading the Euro Area to +0.8%."

The Treasury Department has issued a record $7.2 trillion in government bonds in the first three months of 2024, with $600 billion being brand new debt and $6.6 trillion refinancing existing debt. This trend towards short-term bonds means that the government's annual interest bill will continue to skyrocket due to higher interest rates. The article notes that two years ago, a 90-day T-bill paid about 0.5%, while today it's over 5%. The Fed is expected to step in and ""fix"" this problem by expanding the money supply and slashing interest rates, with minutes from the Fed's meeting last month showing they anticipate cutting rates 2-3 times this year."

The article discusses the impact of the Federal Reserve's (Fed) restrictive policies on inflation, which has risen 3.5% between March 2023 and March 2024, exceeding the Fed's goal of 2%. The author argues that the Biden administration's massive deficits are offsetting the Fed's efforts to reduce liquidity and slow down the economy. High interest rates translate into a bigger federal deficit, exacerbating inflation. The article does not provide specific forecasts or numerical values for future rate changes. However, it suggests that the current economic situation is unfavorable for President Biden, with rising prices and employment issues potentially contributing to his downfall."

The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that consistent firm inflation readings have dampened the likelihood of early rate cuts this year. The Fed requires more time to gain confidence that inflation is stabilizing, potentially delaying any rate reductions. However, President Biden still expects a rate cut this summer.

* Fed rate-cut expectations edged higher, with OIS pricing in 41bp of easing by year-end (up from 38bp at Thursday's close).
* US Treasuries remain richer across the curve after paring the Asia-session advance sparked by reports of an Israeli strike on Iran.
* Yields lower by 4bp to 6bp as US trading gets under way, back toward middle of day’s range.
* The inverted 2s10s spread remains near lows of the day as intermediates outperform, flatter by around 2bp."
2024-04-19 08:20:00,Economic Warning From The NFIB,"Here is a summary of the article's key points related to US interest rates:

The NFIB small business confidence survey declined to its lowest level in 11 years, with higher borrowing costs and tighter lending standards making access to capital more difficult. This has led to a decline in small businesses' plans for capital expenditures (CapEx), which is correlated with slower economic growth. The article suggests that the Fed's decision to cut rates may be justified by these economic warnings, as rising concerns about demand-side issues such as labor costs and sales expectations are contributing to business owners' pessimism."

2024-04-19 13:06:48,World War III Fear Boosts Gold & Oil on Bitcoin Halving Day,"Here is a summary of the article related to US interest rates:

The article mentions that the 10-year yield has risen 80 basis points and the 2-year yield has risen 76 basis points, indicating that yields are at their cycle highs. This suggests that investors expect the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates high for longer than anticipated to try and correct nominally hot economic activity. The threat of a hot war in the Middle East is also contributing to the rise in yields, as investors seek safe-haven assets such as US Treasury bonds. However, the article notes that this could lead to rate cuts and possible direct buying by the Fed to support the US Treasury market."
2024-04-19 17:27:39,Why gold is shrugging off rates AND inflation,"This conversation appears to be between two individuals discussing various topics related to sound money, gold, and Bitcoin. Here's a summary of their discussion:

**Sound Money Movement**

The first speaker mentions seeing a growing movement towards sound money, where individuals are re-adopting gold standards and seeking to protect themselves from government control over the monetary system.

**Monetary Metals**

The second speaker discusses his work at Monetary Metals, which aims to monetize gold as a yield-bearing asset. He explains that gold is currently not being used as collateral or for financing production due to people's perception of it as a commodity rather than a financial asset.

**Removing Barriers to Sound Money**

Both speakers agree that removing barriers and regulations surrounding sound money can help innovation in the space. They mention the 28% collectibles rate on gold at the federal level, which makes it difficult for individuals to use gold as money.

**Legislation and State-Level Action**

The second speaker mentions legislation being introduced or passed at the state level to protect citizens' rights to use sound money. For example, Congressman Alex Mooney is reintroducing a bill to eliminate the incorrect treatment of gold and silver as collectibles on the federal level.

**Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)**

Both speakers express concerns about CBDCs, which they see as a threat to individual freedom and privacy. They argue that CBDCs could be used by governments to control people's financial transactions and suppress dissenting voices.

**Innovation in Sound Money**

The conversation highlights the growing innovation in sound money, including the development of smaller gold pieces for use as money and second-layer solutions for Bitcoin.

Overall, this conversation emphasizes the importance of protecting individual freedom and privacy through the adoption of sound money and the removal of government control over the monetary system."

The Biden Administration's claims that ""inflation is going down"" are disputed by surveys showing 62% of homeowners struggling to make mortgage payments and half of renters facing difficulty keeping up with monthly payments. The Federal Reserve's attempts to use higher interest rates to deflate the housing bubble have failed, as corporate buyers like Blackstone and Black Rock remain unaffected by higher rates due to their central bank support."

The 2Y Yield remains at 5.00%, a key level of focus. Despite geopolitical tensions, oil prices ended lower for the second week in a row. Gold prices spiked overnight on the Israel attack and closed at a new record high, while silver soared 3% to new cycle highs.

2024-04-20 23:23:55,The King $ Is Back!,"Here is a summary of the key points related to US interest rates:

The FED's expected path for rates has been clarified by Jerome Powell, who stated that recent data show a lack of further progress on inflation. This suggests that the FED will NOT cut rates this year, despite 88% probability of a rate cut in September being discounted by Wall Street.

Powell's comments have pushed the bear steepening further out of its 'Halloween hibernation', indicating a potential tightening of financial conditions.

The strengthening USD and rising 10-year yields could be leveraged by the FED to tighten financial conditions, potentially weakening the economy and reducing inflation.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to cut rates in June, but this may be delayed due to the divergence in monetary policy stances between the ECB and the FED.

The spread between US and EUR Zone Economic Surprise suggests that the ECB's rate cuts may be less effective than those of the FED.

Overall, the article suggests that the FED is likely to maintain its current interest rate stance, while the ECB may cut rates in June."

2024-04-22 07:20:00,When Will The Yen Carry Trade End?,"Here is a summary of the article's key points related to US interest rates:

The article discusses the potential end of the ""yen carry trade"" due to Japan's decision to hike interest rates. This could lead to higher bond yields in the US and EU, resulting in higher interest payments and a vicious feedback loop that exposes the insolvency of major national economies. The author notes that rate cuts are still on the table in the US this year, which will further erode the viability of the yen carry trade. The article mentions that if the yen carry trade fully unwinds, it could lead to a spectacular blow-up that takes other parts of the economy with it.

Key points:

* Japan's interest rates are rising, making the yen carry trade riskier
* Higher bond yields in the US and EU expected due to BoJ's actions
* Rate cuts still on the table in the US this year, further eroding the yen carry trade
* Potential for a vicious feedback loop exposing insolvency of major national economies"

* Higher-than-expected interest rates amid persistent inflation are perceived as the biggest threat to financial stability among market participants and observers, according to the Fed's semiannual Financial Stability Report.
* The Fed has entered a quiet period ahead of its May 1 policy announcement, during which time it will not make any public comments on monetary policy.
* Traders are recalibrating their positions after solid US data forced the Fed to reset the clock on its first interest rate cut."

The 2-year US Treasury yield, a Fed Funds proxy, and 10s, a growth/inflation proxy, both spiked 8 basis points moments after the data. Markets are pricing in high inflation expectations and high Fed interest rate expectations. The expectation for the Fed to make rate cuts has shrunk from 3+ by June to zero cuts. This suggests that the Fed may hold interest rates firm despite elevated economic activity and hot price inflation."

* The recent Q1 GDP release showed a slower growth rate of 1.6% (vs. 2.5% expected) and an upside surprise on inflation, with core PCE at +3.7% in Q1.
* This has led investors to price out rate cuts, with the chance of a rate cut by the July meeting falling from 50% to 34%.
* US Treasuries slumped, with the 2yr Treasury yield reaching 4.998%, its highest level since mid-November.
* The 10yr yield was up +6.2bps to 4.70%, but has since come down -1.0bps to 4.69%.
* The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, PCE, is expected to be released today, with a hotter-than-expected reading potentially signaling that US rates will remain higher for longer.
* Consensus expects headline PCE and core PCE to both rise +0.3% MoM in March."
2024-04-26 08:25:00,China Is Pivotal For US Inflation's Path,"Here is a summary of the article's key points related to US interest rates:

The author suggests that a more robust response from China to its economic predicament could lead to higher inflation in the US, adding pressure on term premiums and yields. The San Francisco Fed's analysis shows that most of the decline in core inflation has been driven by non-policy related factors (acyclical component), implying that the cyclical component is still sticky. Falling bond yields in China signal a potential economic crunch point, which could lead to broader stimulus and higher inflation pressures in the US. The author notes that this would be an unwelcome boost for the US economy, which is already dealing with embedded price growth."

The 3-Month annualized core PCE jumped to 4.4%, and services prices drove the acceleration in headline PCE. This data is a blow to ""doves"" who had been hoping for rate cuts. With inflation still high, it's unclear if the Fed will be able to cut rates this year as some have forecasted."

The article discusses the impact of the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy on the Japanese yen. The BoJ has kept interest rates unchanged, and Governor Kazuo Ueda stated that currency volatility could be an important factor in impacting the economy and prices. However, he also said there is ""no major impact"" from the weaker yen on underlying inflation for now.

The article highlights the significant gap between US interest rates, which are at their highest in decades after the Fed's aggressive tightening cycle last year, and Japan's low interest rates near zero. This gap has driven the depreciation of the yen.

Deutsche Bank notes that yen weakness is not a major concern for Japan, as tourism and exports are booming, and core inflation is around 2%. The bank also suggests that negative real rates are beneficial for Japan, creating fiscal space and generating asset gains for the wealthy voting base."

2024-04-26 18:45:00,Bank Failures Begin Again: Philly's Republic First Seized By FDIC,"Here is a summary of the article related to US interest rates, within the 150-word limit:

The article discusses the recent bank failure of Republic First Bancorp in Philadelphia, which had $6 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits. The FDIC estimated the failure will cost $667 million. The article suggests that higher interest rates have left banks ""even more underwater"" with unrealized losses on held-to-maturity assets, totaling almost $400 billion at year-end. This is a concern if the Fed does not cut rates significantly this year. Additionally, US banks saw their largest deposit outflows since 9/11 last week, which could exacerbate the banking crisis.

2024-04-28 22:11:00,How Soros' Latest Agitprop Exposed The Hypocrisy Of The Right,"This is a lengthy and complex article that explores the intersection of politics, ideology, and social movements in the United States. Here's a summary of the main points:

**George Soros' influence on American politics**

The author argues that George Soros, a billionaire philanthropist and investor, has significant influence over American politics through his network of organizations and individuals. The author claims that Soros is using this influence to undermine civil liberties, particularly free speech and assembly, by promoting a narrative that pro-Palestinian protests are inherently violent and antisemitic.

**The manipulation of the Israel/Palestine conflict**

The author suggests that Soros is funding both sides of the Israel/Palestine conflict in order to create a divide-and-conquer strategy. This would allow him to manipulate public opinion and policy decisions to further his own interests, which are aligned with globalism and the suppression of civil liberties.

**False flag operations and media manipulation**

The author presents evidence that pro-Israel groups have been involved in false flag operations, such as sending agitators to protests to provoke violence. The author also suggests that mainstream media outlets have been complicit in promoting a narrative that pro-Palestinian protests are violent and antisemitic.

**The erosion of civil liberties**

The author argues that the suppression of free speech and assembly is a key goal of Soros' influence over American politics. By creating a climate of fear and intimidation, Soros and his allies aim to silence dissenting voices and maintain control over public opinion.

**The corruption of both parties**

The author suggests that Soros' influence has corrupted both major parties in the United States, with Democrats and Republicans alike being influenced by his network of organizations and individuals. This has led to a false dichotomy between the two parties, with neither truly representing the interests of American citizens.

**Conclusion**

The article concludes that George Soros' influence over American politics is a significant threat to civil liberties and democratic values. By manipulating public opinion and policy decisions, Soros aims to create a globalist agenda that suppresses dissenting voices and maintains control over public opinion.

Some potential criticisms of this article include:

* The author's reliance on conspiracy theories and unverifiable sources
* The lack of concrete evidence to support the claims made about Soros' influence
* The oversimplification of complex issues, such as the Israel/Palestine conflict
* The failure to acknowledge the legitimate concerns and grievances of pro-Palestinian activists

Overall, this article presents a provocative and thought-provoking analysis of the intersection of politics, ideology, and social movements in the United States. However, it should be approached with caution and critically evaluated for its methodology and evidence."

The 10-year Treasury yield has reached 4.7%, its highest since November, due to persistent inflation. Experts warn that if it surpasses 5%, it will be a breaking point for markets and the economy. Peter Schiff argues that the Fed is being forced to confront inflation by raising rates, but this would exacerbate debt servicing costs and threaten industries reliant on borrowing. Jack Boroudjian predicts yields will continue to rise, reaching 5-5.5% as the danger zone. Harris Kupperman also warns of a bond market ""aneurism"" if yields continue to climb."

2024-04-29 08:23:57,"Futures Rise, Yen Downgraded To Banana Republic Currency After Another Rollercoaster Session","Here is a summary of the key points related to US interest rates:

* The 10-year Treasury yield fell four basis points to 4.62% ahead of the Treasury's announcement of its funding needs for the coming quarter.
* The FOMC meeting on Wednesday will be critical for markets, with analysts expecting a more hawkish-leaning Fed.
* The jobs report on Friday is expected to show payrolls gaining +240k in April (consensus +250k), down from +303k in March.
* The market sees a solid report, but the unemployment rate and hourly earnings growth rate are expected to stay at 3.8% and +0.3% MoM, respectively.
* The US Treasury quarterly refunding announcement on Wednesday is also significant, with analysts expecting the borrowing estimate to be released today.

Overall, these points suggest that interest rates may remain high for longer than previously anticipated, in line with Fed Chair Jerome Powell's recent comments."
