2024-03-31 00:16:56,Weaponizing The Economy,"Here is a summary of the article's relevant content on INFLATION:

The article discusses various factors that could impact inflation, including supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and energy price shocks. The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore is expected to disrupt US automotive supply chains, potentially impeding ""car disinflation."" Historically, there has been a 6-month lag between the evolution of the NY Fed Global Supply Chain Pressure Index and the year-over-year change in US CPI.

Rising geopolitical tensions and an outright war between Russia and NATO have led to a sharp rebound in oil prices, reaching a fresh 4-month high. This could trigger a major financial shock globally, akin to the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis. The article also mentions that US crude production is now exceeding 13.0 million barrels per day, but pipeline-implied US L48 crude production has declined by nearly 0.4mb/d since December.

The article concludes that a perfect storm of higher crude prices continues to brew as the world's refineries have become major targets."

The article discusses how globalists are using mass immigration and open borders as a tool to destabilize the US economic system and erode national sovereignty. It cites a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that claims higher immigration will add $7 trillion to GDP in the next 10 years, but argues that this is based on flawed assumptions. The article points out that:

* The CBO's theory is contradicted by the fact that the US deficit has fallen due to higher interest rates, not immigration.
* Most illegals have no education, skills, or money, and rely on government handouts, which costs taxpayers over $68,000 per person.
* The jobs market has been inflated by trillions in Federal Reserve stimulus, and most new jobs are low-wage retail and service positions that will disappear soon.

The article concludes that mass immigration is not a solution to the US economic problems, but rather a tool for globalists to destabilize the economy and erode national sovereignty."

2024-04-01 05:00:00,"More Inflation, More Copper Theft","Here is a summary of the article's key points related to INFLATION:

The World Bank estimates that prices for base metals like copper will decline further in 2024 due to improving supply and decreasing demand. However, high inflation may reduce demand, but it appears not enough to offset the speed at which fiat currencies are drained of their purchasing power. If dollar inflation continues, the relative price of copper could rise despite other factors. Copper futures have been trending upward since February, and metal prices soaring have led to a surge in thefts that damage crucial infrastructure. The article suggests that high inflation is causing economic uncertainty, leading to opportunistic mischief by thieves and potentially affecting the broader metals market."

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, California's unemployment rate has risen from 5.0% to 5.3%, the highest in the nation.

The BEA's Personal Income and Outlays report for February 2024 shows inflation data higher than the Fed would like. The PCE price index increased by 0.333% month-over-month, on the high end of the range, suggesting annual price inflation could be around 4.0%. This contradicts the Fed's target of 2.0% inflation and does not support interest rate cuts. The article also mentions that nominal spending was up 0.8%, while real spending was up 0.4%, indicating PCE inflation was on the high side of the range."
2024-04-01 08:30:16,Are You Ready For the Second Wave of Inflation?,"Here is a summary of the article's relevant content on INFLATION, within the 150-word limit:

The article suggests that the Federal Reserve's actions are fueling inflation. The Fed has been keeping interest rates low and providing liquidity to the financial system, which has led to rising housing prices (6% annual growth in January) and a potential second wave of inflation. Inflation was around 6% at the time of the last housing bubble, implying that current conditions may be similar. Gold prices have recently reached new all-time highs, indicating that investors are anticipating higher inflation. The article warns that there is no free lunch with the Fed's actions, and those who are not properly positioned for inflation will suffer losses. The author suggests that certain investments can profit from the next round of inflation, but notes that these opportunities are rapidly being reserved."

2024-04-01 17:19:40,How We Can Fix Our Money,"This is a lengthy and detailed article on the author's proposal for a new economic system, which they call ""economic democracy."" The system aims to address the fundamental problem of the current economic system, which is the ""gap"" between the cost of production (A + B) and the price at which goods and services are sold. This gap leads to poverty, inequality, and unemployment.

The author proposes two main solutions:

1. **National Dividend**: A guaranteed income for every citizen from the age of 18 to death, funded by the national credit office. The dividend would be $2000/month, and it would eliminate the need for welfare and social security programs.
2. **Compensated Price Mechanism**: A system where businesses are rewarded with a sales credit when they sell their goods and services at a price that is higher than their production costs (A + B). This would incentivize businesses to produce high-quality products and reduce waste.

The author also proposes the use of blockchain technology to create an immutable and incorruptible ledger for tracking transactions and ensuring the accuracy of the accounting system. They suggest using open-source software and Git to house the code that implements the system, which would prevent fraud and corruption.

The article outlines several key features of the proposed economic system:

* **Incorruptibility**: The use of blockchain technology ensures that the system is tamper-proof and transparent.
* **Fairness**: Everyone receives a guaranteed income (national dividend) and has access to credit, regardless of their employment status.
* **Efficiency**: Businesses are incentivized to produce high-quality products and reduce waste through the compensated price mechanism.
* **Sustainability**: The system promotes sustainable consumption patterns and reduces pollution.

The author also discusses the potential benefits of this new economic system, including:

* Reduced poverty and inequality
* Increased productivity and efficiency
* Improved quality of life for citizens
* Reduced unemployment and increased job satisfaction

Overall, the article presents a comprehensive proposal for a new economic system that addresses the fundamental problems of the current system. While it is a complex and ambitious plan, it has the potential to create a more equitable and sustainable economy."

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts that interest payments on the national debt will reach $870 billion this year, exceeding military spending. By 2051, interest on the debt will surpass Social Security and Medicare spending. The large and growing interest burden puts pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low, which will erode the dollar's purchasing power and lead to inflation. The author warns that this will result in a major economic meltdown, widespread civil unrest, and new restrictions on liberty. The CBO report also notes that the national debt is expected to exceed 106.4% of GDP by 2028."

This implies that the US economy is outperforming, which could lead to higher interest rates. The author speculates that the gold rally may be driven by a combination of Chinese and official sector buying, possibly due to uncertainty over US debt manageability. However, they also mention algorithmic trading as a possible factor in the market's behavior. No specific inflation rate or CPI data is mentioned, but the article implies that rising interest rates could impact the economy."

2024-04-04 13:54:37,Gold Is on the Rise and Reaches All-Time High,"Here is the relevant information about gold and silver prices:

**Gold Price**

* Gold bullion rose $1.17 (or 4.91%) to close at $24.96 on March 31, 2024.
* Silver has lagged behind gold mainly because central banks and sovereigns are not buying silver.

**Silver Price**

* Silver is expected to be drawn upward in tandem with gold due to its continuing alignment with gold's monetary value.
* The combination of a potentially dwindling free float of silver, steady demand from traditional sectors, and escalating requirements from the burgeoning solar energy industry will likely impact silver prices.
* Three drivers are expected to contribute to a higher silver price: 1) silver maintaining its monetary value as gold prices go higher from central bank and sovereign buying, 2) silver's correlation to the reflation trade, and 3) the massive consumption of silver for photovoltaic panels due to the new growth phase for U.S. electricity demand.

**Central Banks and Sovereigns**

* Central banks and sovereigns are buying gold, which is driving up its price.
* Silver has not broken its correlation with gold despite central banks and sovereigns not buying silver.

**Reflation Trade**

* Global central banks (ex-Bank of Japan) are now entering a synchronized easing cycle, which is likely to benefit the reflation trade.
* Commodities like copper—and, by extension, silver due to their similar economic correlation—may likely perform well as high beta plays of this reflation trade.

**Solar Energy**

* The explosive growth in solar power generation is expected to drive up demand for silver.
* U.S. electricity demand is on the brink of a significant growth phase, driven by AI-related use and other electrification strategies.

Overall, the information suggests that gold prices are rising due to central bank and sovereign buying, while silver prices are expected to follow suit as it maintains its correlation with gold's monetary value. The reflation trade and solar energy demand are also expected to contribute to higher silver prices."

The author argues that the country has been infiltrated by communists, radical leftists, and other enemies who seek to destroy traditional American values and institutions.

The article highlights several key issues, including:

1. **Economic collapse**: The author believes that the massive national debt and out-of-control spending will lead to economic catastrophe.
2. **Energy crisis**: The Biden administration's efforts to restrict energy production and exports will lead to a shortage of electricity, fossil fuels, and heat, causing widespread suffering.
3. **Immigration crisis**: The influx of illegal aliens from unfriendly countries will lead to chaos and violence in America.
4. **Corruption of institutions**: The author argues that every government institution has been corrupted by the infiltration of communists and other enemies of America.
5. **Loss of individual freedoms**: The Biden administration's efforts to impose a digital currency, restrict energy production, and control people's lives will lead to a loss of individual freedoms.

The article also highlights the role of key figures in the Democratic Party, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Chuck Schumer, who are accused of promoting communist ideology and undermining American values.

The author concludes that America is on the brink of a hot civil war between those who support communism and tyranny (the Democrats) and those who support freedom and liberty (conservatives and independents). The article ends with a call to action for patriots to rise up and defend their country against these enemies-from-within and foreign enemies supported by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations.

Overall, the article is a dire warning about the state of America and the need for patriots to take action to preserve freedom and liberty."

The author, who has read David Webb's book ""The Great Taking,"" presents a comprehensive overview of the alleged plan, which includes:

1.  **Financial Collapse**: The author believes that the current debt growth is unsustainable and will lead to a massive financial collapse.
2.  **Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)**: The author claims that CBDCs are being introduced as a means to control people's finances and impose a new form of slavery.
3.  **The Great Reset**: The author believes that the ""Great Reset"" is an anti-human plan to introduce a techno-feudalistic system, built upon fear, scarcity, surveillance, and threats of violence for non-compliance.
4.  **Debt as a Tool of Conquest**: The author argues that debt will be used as a powerful weapon of conquest, allowing the ruling elite to take control of people's property and businesses.

The author also presents some arguments against the plan, including:

1.  **False Hope**: The author believes that non-violent means may not be enough to defeat the power-hungry individuals behind this plan.
2.  **Losing Control**: The author suggests that the ruling elite are losing control, resulting in an acceleration of their plans and mistakes on their part.

The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of awakening people from their ""normalcy stupor"" and resisting the alleged plan through non-violent means.

**Key Points:**

*   The author believes that a financial collapse is imminent due to unsustainable debt growth.
*   Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is being introduced as a means to control people's finances and impose a new form of slavery.
*   The ""Great Reset"" is an anti-human plan to introduce a techno-feudalistic system, built upon fear, scarcity, surveillance, and threats of violence for non-compliance.
*   Debt will be used as a powerful weapon of conquest, allowing the ruling elite to take control of people's property and businesses.

**Critical Thinking:**

While the article presents some compelling arguments, it is essential to approach this topic with a critical eye. Some points to consider:

1.  **Lack of concrete evidence**: The author relies heavily on David Webb's book as the primary source of information.
2.  **Conspiracy theory**: The article presents a conspiracy theory that may not be supported by empirical evidence.
3.  **Overemphasis on fear**: The article focuses primarily on the negative aspects of the alleged plan, which may create unnecessary fear and anxiety.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Seek multiple sources**: Verify information through reputable sources to ensure accuracy.
2.  **Evaluate evidence critically**: Consider the strength of evidence presented in support of the conspiracy theory.
3.  **Focus on solutions**: Instead of dwelling on the negative aspects, explore potential solutions and ways to prepare for any potential financial collapse.

By approaching this topic with a critical eye and considering multiple perspectives, individuals can make informed decisions about their financial security and well-being."

2024-04-08 06:30:00,What Is Driving Gold To All-Time Highs?,"Here is a summary of the article's relevant content on inflation:

The article discusses how high inflation is contributing to gold's recent rise. US year-over-year inflation increased at a 2.5% rate in February, causing traders to slightly dial back their expectations for Federal Funds Rate cuts this year. The Bank of America's commodities strategist Michael Widmer notes that the market is interpreting the Fed as willing to accommodate higher inflation as it cuts rates. Additionally, sharp surges in commodity prices, crude oil, and U.S. wholesale gasoline prices are likely indications of higher future inflation rates.

The article also mentions that the stagnating and declining production of gold from mines around the world is supporting the price of gold. The US Geological Survey's estimate that all known gold reserves could be depleted in just 17 years further supports this trend.

Overall, the article suggests that high inflation and economic uncertainty are driving up the price of gold, making it a hedge against rising prices and a safe-haven asset for investors."

He notes that persistent inflationary pressures may continue, driven by factors such as fiscal spending, remilitarization, and restructuring of global trade. Dimon also highlights the potential for quantitative tightening to drain liquidity from the system, exacerbating inflation risks.

2024-04-09 07:20:00,Traders' Doubts Fed Can Hit Inflation Goal Underscore CPI Risks,"Here is a summary of the article's key points related to INFLATION, within the 150-word limit:

The US Treasury market is anticipating a strong inflation reading in this week's CPI release. Despite expectations that consumer-price gains will ease, economists forecast headline annual inflation above 3%. Surging oil and commodity prices, as well as supply disruptions, are contributing to rising costs. As a result, two-year breakeven rates have climbed to around 30bps under February's CPI. If the actual inflation rate comes in at 2.85%, it may indicate that the Fed will not meet its target, casting doubt on their ability to deliver six rate cuts by the end of next year. This suggests that inflation risks are tilted to the upside, with potential implications for interest rates and monetary policy."
2024-04-09 07:45:00,US Small-Business Optimism Slides To 11-Year Low As Bidenomics Fails,"Here is a summary of the article's key points related to INFLATION, within the 150-word limit:

US inflation remains a significant concern as small businesses' confidence plummets to its lowest level in over a decade. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) reported a decline in its small-business optimism index to 88.5, with 25% of business owners citing inflation as their largest issue. This represents a 2-point increase from February and highlights the impact of increased costs for inputs and labor. Additionally, the proportion of businesses increasing their average selling prices rose by 7 points compared to the previous month. Rising gasoline prices, inching closer to $4 a gallon, have likely contributed to the souring mood. The NFIB's report is a major concern, as small firms are the economic engine of the economy and their hiring plans in March were the weakest since May 2020."
2024-04-09 08:10:54,Futures Flat In Cautious Trade Ahead Of CPI As Gold Roars To New Record High,"Here is a summary of the article's key points related to INFLATION:

US inflation is expected to show some further easing of price pressures in tomorrow's CPI print, but may surprise to the upside after the recent surge in oil prices. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the core gauge, which excludes food and energy costs, to be up 3.7% from a year earlier - above the Fed's 2% target. Concerns are for hotter prints in the future, reflecting the ongoing surge in gold and copper prices. The US 5yr inflation swap hit 2.57% by yesterday's close, marking its highest level since October. Market pricing suggests fewer rate cuts this year, with just two US rate cuts priced this year, down from three previously."
2024-04-09 08:25:00,"In The Next Several Weeks, We Could See $300 Billion Of Liquidity Leaving The System","Here is a summary of the article's relevant content on inflation:

The article discusses the potential for a significant contraction in liquidity, which could lead to a larger drawdown in the stock market. The authors estimate that over $300 billion of liquidity could leave the system in the next few weeks due to tax deadlines and quantitative tightening (QT). This could have implications for inflation, as reduced liquidity can lead to higher interest rates and increased borrowing costs. However, the article does not provide specific forecasts or numerical values on inflation rates. The authors mention that the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasuries has moved from 3.78% to 4.40%, but do not explicitly link this to inflation expectations."

Dollar Tree has increased prices to $7 across thousands of stores nationwide. CEO Rick Dreiling stated that the company will expand its multi-price assortment by over 300 items at price points ranging from $1.50 to $7. This move is attributed to ""persistent inflationary pressures"" and ""macroeconomic headwinds"". The article also mentions the closure of 99 Cents Only stores due to rising levels of shrink, persistent inflationary pressures, and other macroeconomic headwinds. Economists are concerned about the trend of bargain store closures, which they attribute to inflation. No specific inflation rate or CPI data is mentioned in the article. However, it suggests that inflation is having a significant impact on retailers, leading them to raise prices and close stores."

The article mentions inflation as a factor contributing to rising spot prices for gold, which have increased by over 13% YTD. The author notes that this rise in gold prices is linked to ""persistent inflation"" and concerns about the US fiscal situation. Additionally, the article states that Costco's aggressive pricing of its gold bars, selling at around $2,400 (2% above the spot price), suggests a low-profit business. However, there are no specific inflation rate forecasts or numerical values provided in the article related to US inflation. The focus is on the impact of inflation on gold prices and investor sentiment rather than direct economic indicators of inflation."

US inflation worries are back in focus due to soaring commodity prices and persistently high inflation. The market is pricing in rate cuts this year, but some investors are nervous about stretched valuations ahead of earnings season. JPMorgan expects a cooler CPI print to be a boon for risk assets, while acknowledging it's harder for inflation to slow given the strong labor market and higher commodity prices. Inflation expectations have been strengthening in the US and Europe, with breakevens and swap rates creeping higher.

Key points:

* Soaring commodity prices are causing inflation worries
* Market is pricing in rate cuts this year
* JPMorgan expects a cooler CPI print to be positive for risk assets
* Inflation expectations are rising in the US and Europe"
2024-04-10 07:32:31,"CPI Preview: The First ""Miss"" Of 2024?","Here is a summary of the article's key points related to INFLATION:

The upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report is expected to be a crucial indicator for inflation. A hot number would indicate rising inflation, which could lead to a ""risk off"" market reaction and potentially rule out a Federal Reserve rate cut in June or 2024. The article suggests that three consecutive months of core CPI coming in hotter than expectations may already be pricing in a more hawkish Fed stance. If the CPI print is red-hot, it would likely confirm this narrative, leading to a collapse in risk assets if rate cuts are taken off the table."

The US CPI print will be heavily in focus today after the last two prints came in strongly. Economists forecast that consumer prices rose 0.3% in March on a monthly basis, which would mark a step down from the previous two months. However, if the number comes in hot, it could put a question mark on whether the Fed will cut interest rates at all this summer and potentially delay rate cuts until September. The market is expecting stocks to move 2% either way on a surprise inflation number."
2024-04-10 08:15:00,Inflation Has Become A Bigger Risk For Stretched Gold Prices,"Here is a summary of the article's key points related to INFLATION:

The author notes that inflation continues to be biased higher. The current real fed funds rate is 2.3%, which is above the sweet spot for gold returns (between -2% and +2%). This suggests that gold is more sensitive to inflation, making it vulnerable to a selloff if today's inflation data comes in softer than expected. However, the author expects any dips in gold to be short-lived, as real yields are unlikely to deviate far from their sweet spot in the medium term.

Key points:

* Inflation continues to be biased higher
* Real fed funds rate is 2.3%, above the sweet spot for gold returns
* Gold is more sensitive to inflation and vulnerable to a selloff if inflation data comes in softer than expected"

The article discusses California's Assembly Bill 205 (AB 205), which aims to shift utility rate-setting from usage-based charges to income-based fixed fees. This change would see higher-income customers paying more for energy, while low-income customers pay less. The legislation also requires utilities to reduce rates for electricity usage and invest in infrastructure for wildfire prevention and renewable energy. However, questions have arisen about the potential impact on energy conservation incentives and the feasibility of implementing this new rate-setting model by July 2024. There is no mention of specific inflation rates or forecasts, but the article suggests that the legislation may lead to increased revenue for utilities and potentially higher prices for high-income customers."

The US CPI print came in hotter than expected, triggering a market rout and reversing expectations for Fed rate cuts. The swaps market initially priced in 65 basis points of Fed rate cuts by year-end, but now expects less than two 25 basis-point moves for all of 2024. State Street Global Advisors' prediction of an aggressive half-point Fed rate cut by June was also dashed. The strong inflation reading led to a shift in expectations, with the first full quarter-point rate cut now expected in November instead of September."

The article mentions that hotter consumer prices in the US may complicate matters for the Federal Reserve. Implied interest rate swaps show less than two cuts are being priced in for the year, down from 7 in early January. This suggests that inflation expectations are still high, and interest rates may remain higher for longer.

The author argues that gold and silver are severely undervalued due to the decline in purchasing power of fiat currencies, particularly the US dollar. Since 1971, the value of the dollar has crashed by 98.5% in real terms, while gold's price has increased from $35 to $2,300. Adjusting for inflation using Shadow Government Statistics' calculation, the gold price equivalent of the 1980 high of $850 would be $29,200 today. The author also notes that gold and silver have not kept pace with money supply or inflation, making them attractive investments for long-term wealth preservation. In contrast to stocks, bonds, and property, which are likely to decline in real terms, gold has outperformed major asset classes since 2000, with a compound annual return of 9.2%. The author believes that the current secular bull market in gold and silver will reach unprecedented heights."

US CPI came in hot, prompting doubts about a June Fed rate cut. The dollar and 10-year treasury yields rallied, but gold surprisingly ignored the inflation data and instead dropped $30 before bouncing back. This suggests that the gold buyer has real conviction and is keen to hit the bid on any dips. The article notes that gold's resilience in the face of strong inflation data is unusual, as it typically reacts negatively to such news. However, the rally remains resilient, with the path of least resistance being higher. No specific inflation rate or forecast is mentioned, but the article implies that the strong inflation data has cast doubts on a potential Fed rate cut."

US inflation has returned, with core CPI and overall CPI exhibiting significant annualized increases in March. This marks the worst inflation in a year for core CPI and since November 2022 for overall CPI. The Federal Reserve's hopes to significantly decrease interest rates have been dashed, and investors now expect only two rate cuts this year, down from as high as six at the beginning of the year. President Biden has also predicted a rate cut by the end of the year, despite stubbornly high inflation. Analysts predict a surge in bitcoin's post-halving dollar exchange rate, with Bitfinex forecasting a 160% increase targeting a range of $150,000 to $169,000. The return of inflation is driven by persistent inflation in core services, despite slight declines in durable goods prices and relatively stable (but high) food prices."

The US has experienced two significant inflationary breakouts in modern history: one during Powell's 2020/21 policy and another potentially imminent. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has raised interest rates to their highest level in 4 decades to combat inflation. However, the market is now betting on a second wave of inflation, with Goldman Sachs' new GS1970 Inflation Comeback basket (GSXU1970) indicating that traders expect a return to the high-inflation era of the 1970s. This suggests that inflation may be more resilient than expected, with rates potentially rising as high as 15% if history repeats itself."

* The US approaching a ""Minsky Moment"" with $1 trillion in debt issued every 100 days
* Interest on US debt set to surpass Social Security spending and become the single largest government outlay before the end of 2024 ($1.6 trillion)
* BofA CIO Michael Hartnett's report noting that investors are hedging against the risk of Fed rate cuts as CPI accelerates
* A divergence between gold prices and 10Y real rates, suggesting a potential economic downturn

Additionally, UBS' trading desk notes that ""gold futures gapped up $10 as they traded through Thursday's high on what felt like stop losses being triggered;0.5moz of futures volume were behind the move.""

The article also mentions forecasts for gold prices, including BofA commodities strategist Michael Widmer predicting a rally to US$3,000/oz by 2025 and UBS predicting that the price of gold could double from here.

Overall, the article suggests that inflation concerns are rising, with investors hedging against potential economic downturns and gold prices surging as a result."

The US price cap on Russian oil has been ineffective, with Urals grade oil selling for $75 a barrel, far above the $60 cap. This has led to ""dissonance"" between the attestation required by western companies and the actual prices paid. The Biden administration claims the cap is still having its intended effect, but data shows that at least 23% of Russian oil shipments have insurance provided by members of the International Group of P&I Clubs, requiring attestation for cargoes that clearly cost more than $60. This has resulted in traders fabricating data to comply with the cap. The article suggests that the price cap is not reducing Russia's revenue from oil sales and may even be increasing it."

Here are the key points discussed:

**The Safe Haven Narrative**

* The idea that gold is a safe haven asset is gaining traction, especially among investors who are concerned about the stability of the US dollar.
* This narrative doesn't require catastrophic predictions or doomsday scenarios; it's simply about being prepared for potential economic shocks and preserving wealth.
* Gold can appreciate in value even if there isn't an immediate crisis, as its price can rise due to a long-term trend of increasing demand or decreasing supply.

**The Inflation Hedge vs. Safe Haven**

* The inflation hedge narrative is not entirely accurate, as gold's price doesn't always correlate perfectly with inflation.
* However, the safe haven narrative is stronger because it's based on human psychology and behavior, rather than just economic data.
* Gold can appreciate in value even if there isn't an immediate crisis, as its price can rise due to a long-term trend of increasing demand or decreasing supply.

**The Role of Central Banks**

* Central banks are unlikely to return to a gold standard anytime soon, but they do hold gold as a reserve asset and recognize its monetary value.
* The premium that the market sets for gold's monetary use above its commodity uses is evidence of its continued importance in the global financial system.

**Gold vs. Bitcoin**

* The competition between gold and Bitcoin is becoming increasingly intense, with both assets vying for attention from investors.
* However, gold still has a significant advantage due to its established track record, liquidity, and monetary value.

**Conclusion**

* Gold's price of $2,300 per ounce reflects its continued importance as a financial asset, even if it's not being used as a medium of exchange or a unit of account.
* The safe haven narrative is gaining traction, and gold can appreciate in value even without an immediate crisis.
* Ultimately, gold remains a valuable asset for investors who want to preserve wealth and protect themselves from potential economic shocks."

The article discusses inflation and its impact on various economic indicators. According to the University of Michigan's consumer survey for April, inflation expectations on the 1-year and 5-10 year horizons came in higher than expected, suggesting that price inflation will remain elevated for several months more. The headline number for March consumer prices rose from 3.2% to 3.5%, beating estimates of 3.4%. Core inflation was flat at 3.8%, while supercore inflation (inflation in core services excluding housing) rose to 4.8% year-over-year. This suggests that consumers are spending more, and price inflation is accelerating. The article also notes that CPI has now spent 10 of the past 12 months above 3%, which is a full 50% higher than the Fed's long-run target range of 2%."

Fund managers are heavily betting on further price increases, holding bullish long positions equivalent to 99 million barrels, the highest level in over four years. Low inventories, strong consumption, and elevated hurricane risk to US refineries are expected to contribute to upward pressure on prices. The forecast is for an ""extremely active"" hurricane season in 2024, which could disrupt refinery processing and further drive up prices."

The US economy faces an ""Urban Doop Loop"" triggered by Commercial Real Estate (CRE) vacancies, which could lead to a broader economic meltdown in a still inflationary environment. According to Moody's Analytics, there are more dormant office towers in the US than at any point since 1979. The Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle is expected to endure, suggesting that challenges are approaching, possibly after the presidential election. The high amount of debt extended and modified instead of refinanced has helped mitigate a potential default wave, but stresses are mounting in the office segment. The percentage of fully paid-off tower loans at maturity dropped below 60%, while modifications will likely persist due to uneconomical refinancing costs. This trend raises concerns about the sustainability of CRE market conditions."

The report notes that demand for electric vehicles has dipped as governments reduce subsidies and soften goals to phase out petrol and diesel cars. In the UK, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak delayed the prohibition of new petrol and diesel sales from 2030 to 2035, further impacting EV sales.

The White House announced plans to triple tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum from 7.5% to 22.5%, citing China's ""policy-driven overcapacity"" as a threat to the US steel industry. However, experts warn that higher tariffs can spark inflation and drive negative supply shocks. A senior administration official claimed that these actions will not increase inflation, but basic economics suggests otherwise. The article also notes that inflation is reaccelerating, contrary to expectations of returning to sub-2% levels as per Fed Powell's comfort zone. The Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act has failed to bring inflation under control. The move is seen as a political stunt ahead of the elections in key battleground states."
2024-04-17 07:45:00,Peter Schiff: The Data Looks Grim For The Dollar,"Here is a summary of the article's key points related to INFLATION in the US:

* The latest CPI report showed a 0.4% increase from last month, with year-over-year inflation at 3.5%, far above the Fed's 2% target.
* Despite this, the media and policymakers are still suggesting that interest rates should be cut, rather than hiked to combat rising inflation.
* The author argues that the rising gold price is a clear signal that interest rates are too low and need to be increased sharply, by at least 200 basis points.
* The author believes that if the Fed continues its inflationary policy, it will lead to disaster and worsen the coming crisis."
2024-04-17 08:11:18,Futures Rebound After 3 Day Rout As Rates Drop From 2024 Highs,"Here's a summary of the key points from the article:

**Global Markets**

* Global markets experienced a selloff on both sides of the Atlantic due to concerns about higher-for-longer interest rates and inflation.
* The STOXX 600 fell by 1.53%, its worst performance in 9 months, while the S&P 500 fell by 0.21%.
* US high yield spreads widened for the fourth session in a row, the longest such run since January.

**Fed and Interest Rates**

* Fed Vice Chair Jefferson stated that if incoming data suggest inflation is more persistent than expected, it will be appropriate to hold in place the current restrictive stance of policy for longer.
* Fed Chair Powell echoed these comments, saying that it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve confidence in the path of inflation.
* As a result, investors priced in only 40bps of cuts by year-end, the lowest this has been so far in this cycle.

**ECB and European Markets**

* ECB President Lagarde confirmed that the ECB is moving closer towards a rate cut, but noted that they need to pay attention to changes in exchange rates.
* Investors slightly dialled back the chance of a June cut, which fell from 90% to 87%.
* Sovereign bonds sold off across Europe, with yields on 10yr bunds, OATs, and BTPs all experiencing fresh losses.

**Energy Prices**

* Natural gas prices rose another +6.53% to €33.45/MWh, well off the recent lows of €25.80/MWh on April 3.
* Oil prices saw some stabilisation, with Brent Crude down a marginal -0.09% to $90.02 yesterday.

**Equities**

* Equities experienced a fresh selloff on both sides of the Atlantic due to concerns about higher-for-longer interest rates and inflation.
* The S&P 500 only fell by 0.21%, but this was still a broad decline, with banks underperforming within the index.

**Data Releases**

* Japan's exports grew +7.3% y/y in March, while imports fell -4.9% y/y.
* US industrial production was in line with expectations, showing +0.4% growth in March.
* The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model for Q1 is pointing to an annualised growth rate of 2.9%, up a tenth relative to the previous day.

**IMF World Economic Outlook**

* The IMF upgraded their global growth forecast for 2024 by a tenth relative to January, and now see growth of +3.2% this year.
* They also upgraded their US growth forecast to +2.7%, while downgrading the Euro Area to +0.8%."

The US government's massive debt issuance has led to rising interest rates, with 90-day T-bills increasing from 0.5% to over 5%. This means the government's annual interest bill will skyrocket, potentially exceeding $2 trillion in the next few years. The Federal Reserve is expected to step in and ""fix"" this problem by expanding the money supply and slashing interest rates, despite rising inflation numbers. In fact, Fed Chairman has all but ruled out further interest rate increases, suggesting that inflation may be tolerated as a lesser evil compared to government insolvency. This sets the stage for more inflation, which can be prepared for and potentially benefited from."

US inflation persists, with prices rising 3.5% between March 2023 and March 2024, exceeding the Federal Reserve's goal of 2%. This follows three years of price increases. The Biden administration's massive deficits are offsetting the Fed's restrictive policies, contributing to higher inflation.

2024-04-19 08:20:00,Economic Warning From The NFIB,"Here is a summary of the article's key points related to INFLATION, particularly US inflation:

The NFIB small business confidence survey declined to its lowest level in 11 years, indicating a recessionary economy. Higher interest rates and tighter lending standards are impeding business growth for small businesses, making access to capital more difficult. As a result, small business owners are cutting back on capital expenditures (CapEx), which will eventually translate into slower private investment and economic growth. The correlation between small business CapEx plans and economic growth suggests caution, despite optimistic headlines about an ""economic reflation."" Rising concerns about the demand side of the equation, including labor costs and sales, also indicate a weakening economy."

The article discusses the impact of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East on inflation. The threat of war has led to a surge in oil prices, which could contribute to higher gas prices and inflation. The US Treasury's $2-trillion deficit and 50% over-budget status for 2024 also increases the risk of monetary inflation. Gold is seen as a hedge against geopolitical risk and inflation, with its price rising 17.8% year-to-date compared to the S&P 500's 5.7%. The article suggests that Bitcoin may be a better hedge against monetary inflation due to its supply inelasticity and scarcity, which will increase after the upcoming halving event."
2024-04-19 17:27:39,Why gold is shrugging off rates AND inflation,"This conversation appears to be between two individuals discussing various topics related to sound money, gold, and Bitcoin. Here's a summary of their discussion:

**Sound Money Movement**

The first speaker mentions seeing a growing movement towards sound money, where individuals are re-adopting gold standards and seeking to protect themselves from government control over the monetary system.

**Monetary Metals**

The second speaker discusses his work at Monetary Metals, which aims to monetize gold as a yield-bearing asset. He explains that gold is currently not being used as collateral or for financing production due to people's perception of it as a commodity rather than a financial asset.

**Removing Barriers to Sound Money**

Both speakers agree that removing barriers and regulations surrounding sound money can help innovation in the space. They mention the 28% collectibles rate on gold at the federal level, which makes it difficult for individuals to use gold as money.

**Legislation and State-Level Action**

The second speaker mentions legislation being introduced or passed at the state level to protect citizens' rights to use sound money. For example, Congressman Alex Mooney is reintroducing a bill to eliminate the incorrect treatment of gold and silver as collectibles on the federal level.

**Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)**

Both speakers express concerns about CBDCs, which they see as a threat to individual freedom and privacy. They argue that CBDCs could be used by governments to control people's financial transactions and suppress dissenting voices.

**Innovation in Sound Money**

The conversation highlights the growing innovation in sound money, including the development of smaller gold pieces for use as money and second-layer solutions for Bitcoin.

Overall, this conversation emphasizes the importance of protecting individual freedom and privacy through the adoption of sound money and the removal of government control over the monetary system."
2024-04-19 18:00:00,The World's Economic Myths Are Hitting Their Limits,"Here is a summary of the article's relevant content on inflation:

No relevant content related to inflation was found in the article. However, there are some indirect mentions of economic indicators and potential issues that could impact inflation in the US and China.

The article does mention that the rate of growth in the US was only 3.3% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to 47% one year ago. It also notes that Tesla is laying off 10% of its staff due to high prices of EVs and lack of charging infrastructure.

Additionally, the article mentions a forecast by the Solar Energy Industries Association and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie indicating that US solar panel installations by homeowners are expected to fall by 13% in 2024. This could potentially impact inflation if it leads to reduced economic activity.

However, these points are not directly related to inflation rates or forecasts, but rather to broader economic indicators and potential issues that could impact the economy."

The article highlights the US housing crisis, which is exacerbating inflationary pressures. Despite the Biden Administration's claims that ""inflation is going down"", surveys show that 62% of homeowners and half of all renters have struggled to make payments in the past year. The average yearly cost of a family home rental is $25,000, surpassing the common 30% rent rule. This has led to a shortage of affordable housing, with at least 7.2 million homes unaffordable for extremely low-income renters. General inflation is also contributing to the crisis, with building costs skyrocketing due to increased demand and supply chain issues. To alleviate the market conditions, state-imposed moratoriums on corporate home purchases and foreign purchases are suggested, as well as direct removal of illegal migrants."

The article also mentions that Treasury yields ended the week higher, but not before plunging overnight on geopolitical chaos. The 2Y Yield remains at 5.00%, a key level to watch.

The FED's Jerome Powell admitted that recent data show a lack of further progress on inflation, which has tempered the FED's intentions for rate cuts. The US CPI YoY change is not mentioned in the article, but it is implied that inflation remains a concern.

The ECB is expected to cut rates in June, despite the FED's reluctance to ease monetary policy. The ECB's decision is driven by concerns about economic stability and confidence in the eurozone ahead of the European Parliament election.

Inflation in Europe is still a concern, with services CPI figures tempering the ECB's intentions for rate cuts. However, the ECB believes that a cut would be appropriate to maintain policy restrictive enough to avoid derailing the disinflation process.

The article also mentions the impact of energy prices on inflation, particularly natural gas prices, which have increased due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Overall, the article suggests that inflation remains a concern in both the US and Europe, with central banks taking steps to address it through monetary policy."

The article discusses the potential end of the ""yen carry trade"" due to Japan's interest rate hikes. However, it notes that even with higher rates, inflation remains a concern globally. The author states that ""rampant inflation"" is causing the dollar to lose value, despite its relative strength against other currencies. The article also mentions that if the BoJ starts dumping US Treasurys, yields could rise, leading to a vicious cycle of strengthening dollar and weakening yen. This could lead to a global margin call and economic collapse.

Key points:

* Rampant inflation causing dollar to lose value
* Yen carry trade becoming riskier due to interest rate hikes in Japan
* Potential for rising US Treasury yields if BoJ dumps bonds
* Global margin call and economic collapse possible if yen carry trade unwinds"

The core PCE deflator is expected to come in at +0.30% vs. +0.26% last month, dropping the YoY rate to 2.7%. This would be within a whisker of rounding up to 2.8%, a level that both Chair Powell and Vice Chair Jefferson suggested was pencilled in by the Fed staff.

The article also mentions that higher-than-expected interest rates amid persistent inflation are perceived as the biggest threat to financial stability among market participants and observers, according to the Fed's semiannual Financial Stability Report published Friday.

For example, California will face a combined federal-state rate of 59%.

The correlation between Core PCE and headline consumer price inflation is clear, with CPI potentially heading back above 4% sooner than expected.

The US personal consumption data (PCE) release today is expected to show a hotter-than-expected reading, which may signal that US rates will remain higher for longer. The consensus expects headline PCE and core PCE to both rise +0.3% MoM. This follows Thursday's weaker GDP figures, which showed an annualized rate of +1.6%, the slowest growth since Q2 2022, and a core PCE surprise on the upside at +3.7%.

US inflation is proving ""sticky"" and adding to longer-term upwards pressure on yields. The core-PCE price index has been higher-than-expected, indicating upside risks to the US PCE release today. Most of the fall in core inflation has been driven by the acyclical component, which is highly correlated to China's PPI. If China responds with broader stimulus, it could boost inflation pressures in the US, where price growth is becoming embedded. The article suggests that US inflation may be more stubborn than expected due to global factors, particularly China's economic recovery."

The average cost of gas at the pump across the US was $3.66 as of Thursday, up from $3.10 in mid-January. Stagflation concerns are growing, with recent upticks in consumer price inflation driven by services, housing, and fuel. Experts warn that if Ukraine targets Russia's crude export ports, global oil prices would tick up, driving up inflation and cost-of-living pressures in the US.

This could result in an explosion in inflation-linked asset prices and potentially even hyperinflation (""Project Zimbabwe""). Kupperman expects the bond market to have an ""aneurism"" as it refuses to fund the Treasury's spending levels, leading to a short-term decline in asset prices followed by a surge in inflation.

US inflation expectations rose to 3.2% in April, according to the UMich sentiment survey, the highest level since November 2023.

Japan's core CPI is around 2% and has been decelerating in recent months. The Tokyo CPI was 1.7% excluding one-off effects. While inflation may accelerate again due to FX weakness and high wage growth, the starting point of inflation is different from post-COVID hiking cycles of other central banks. Deutsche Bank notes that yen weakness leads to huge capital gains on foreign bonds and equities for Japan's government pension fund (GPIF). The bank concludes that there isn't an inflation problem in Japan, and negative real rates are beneficial for the country's consolidated government balance sheet. A shift in BoJ inflation forecasts to well above 2% would be a clear signal of a change in reaction function."

2024-04-28 22:11:00,How Soros' Latest Agitprop Exposed The Hypocrisy Of The Right,"This is a lengthy and complex article that explores the intersection of politics, ideology, and social movements in the United States. Here's a summary of the main points:

**George Soros' influence on American politics**

The author argues that George Soros, a billionaire philanthropist and investor, has significant influence over American politics through his network of organizations and individuals. The author claims that Soros is using this influence to undermine civil liberties, particularly free speech and assembly, by promoting a narrative that pro-Palestinian protests are inherently violent and antisemitic.

**The manipulation of the Israel/Palestine conflict**

The author suggests that Soros is funding both sides of the Israel/Palestine conflict in order to create a divide-and-conquer strategy. This would allow him to manipulate public opinion and policy decisions to further his own interests, which are aligned with globalism and the suppression of civil liberties.

**False flag operations and media manipulation**

The author presents evidence that pro-Israel groups have been involved in false flag operations, such as sending agitators to protests to provoke violence. The author also suggests that mainstream media outlets have been complicit in promoting a narrative that pro-Palestinian protests are violent and antisemitic.

**The erosion of civil liberties**

The author argues that the suppression of free speech and assembly is a key goal of Soros' influence over American politics. By creating a climate of fear and intimidation, Soros and his allies aim to silence dissenting voices and maintain control over public opinion.

**The corruption of both parties**

The author suggests that Soros' influence has corrupted both major parties in the United States, with Democrats and Republicans alike being influenced by his network of organizations and individuals. This has led to a false dichotomy between the two parties, with neither truly representing the interests of American citizens.

**Conclusion**

The article concludes that George Soros' influence over American politics is a significant threat to civil liberties and democratic values. By manipulating public opinion and policy decisions, Soros aims to create a globalist agenda that suppresses dissenting voices and maintains control over public opinion.

Some potential criticisms of this article include:

* The author's reliance on conspiracy theories and unverifiable sources
* The lack of concrete evidence to support the claims made about Soros' influence
* The oversimplification of complex issues, such as the Israel/Palestine conflict
* The failure to acknowledge the legitimate concerns and grievances of pro-Palestinian activists

Overall, this article presents a provocative and thought-provoking analysis of the intersection of politics, ideology, and social movements in the United States. However, it should be approached with caution and critically evaluated for its methodology and evidence."

The yen's decline has sparked concerns about inflation in Japan. However, Deutsche Bank argues that yen weakness is not a significant problem for Japan, citing booming tourism and exporter competitiveness. The bank notes that core CPI is around 2% and has been decelerating in recent months. While inflation may accelerate again due to FX weakness and high wage growth, the starting point of inflation is different from other countries. The article mentions that negative real rates are beneficial for Japan's consolidated government balance sheet, creating fiscal space and generating asset gains. However, some analysts suggest that a shift in BoJ inflation forecasts to above 2% would be a clear signal of a change in reaction function. Overall, the article suggests that inflation is not a major concern in Japan at this time."

Peter Schiff warns that once it surpasses 5%, it will be a breaking point for markets and the economy.

The article suggests that bond traders will continue to sell bonds, driving yields up, making it difficult for the Fed to cut rates and instead forcing them to fight inflation head-on."

US inflation data was mentioned as being ""net net worrying"" last week, but the March PCE inflation print came in line with expectations at +0.3% month-on-month and +2.7% year-on-year. The core print was also in line with consensus at +0.3% month-on-month and +2.8% year-on-year. This allowed markets to breathe a slight sigh of relief.

The article notes that the Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that policymakers were likely to keep borrowing costs high for longer than previously anticipated, pointing to the lack of further progress on bringing inflation down. The US 10-year yields fell four basis points to 4.62% ahead of today's announcement by the Treasury of its funding needs for the coming quarter.

The article also mentions that European equities advanced last week, with the STOXX 600 up +1.74%, and that the FTSE 100 hit another record high after gaining +3.09%. However, this is not directly related to inflation.

Overall, the article suggests that inflation remains a concern for markets, but the recent data has been in line with expectations."
