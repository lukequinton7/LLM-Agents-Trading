This documentary is very well made.

Whenever revelatory or self-evident truths about prevailing official narratives begin to make the lies collapse in on themselves, we always see the cultists-du-jour cornered like dangerous animals, ready to lash out for one last stand…Climate lockdowns could be right around the corner - perhaps the finalfusing of so called “climate emergency” with “health crisis”- cementing in the minds of the masses that these are one and the same.

This film is packed with useful information, historical data, and sane, brave, talking heads who have been demonised for standing firm in their outspokenness against the climate cult.

These two parts are absolutely spot-on:

It’s clear - it’s now acult completely divorced from science…

But the apparently unstoppableclimate scaredoes not just represent anattack on science. It is starting toshape for us a new kind of society. Environmentalists like toposeas anti-establishment. But their demands are well-received andpiously echoedby King Charles, the archbishop of Canterbury, the BBC, the UN, the EU, by heads of government…The World Bank, and World Economic Forum. In fact, by theentire state-funded ruling establishment.

What normally happens in an emergency, is that all normal forms of openness and democracy have to be suppressed. Because, how else to deal with an emergency? So, we are facing a situation, not unlike lockdowns, where basically, all normal forms of behavior, normal forms of social communication, and normal forms of democracy are essentially ruled out.

Activists are even calling, for any skepticism to be criminalized. In certain jobs and professions, it is now dangerous to express dissent on climate. It's no surprise that people, who are more skeptical, will think twice, before voicing their concerns because they might risk their careers. They might risk their business. They might risk being sacked. If you're a professional of any kind, in science, or law, or medicine. If you belong to a professional association, or you are in a university, you can be fired, for saying what you believe.

The consequence is a censorious authoritarian regime, that has to controlevery move, every word, everything you want to do. Because, everything you do, is a potential riskto the survival of mankind.

I also encourage readers to peruse the work of the CO2 Coalition, and their superb paper -Challenging “Net Zero” with Science -which is summarisedhere.

2024-03-30 09:17:37,Larry Fink is Not Your Friend,https://web.archive.org/web/20240331133044/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-03-30/dear-india-larry-fink-not-your-friend,"""India's love for gold has done little for Larry Fink and Blackrock""

Authored byGoldFixZH Edit

Good morning. I’d like to address the Indian community of potential investors as well as Americans who see these.

Larry Fink, the other day had an interview onCNBC, a conversation about India and its capital markets.

He was extolling the virtues of American capital markets and saying that India's propensity to save in assets like gold were hindering its economic growth.

Now there are merits to this concept. The US capital market has been a great thing in helping leverage innovation and ingenuity towards economic growth and progress for all humanity. But all things can get overdone, especially when capital doesn’t get allocated based on merit.

And upon being overdone, abused capital markets, like anything not taken in moderation, cause great strife for those of us not in the cadre of elitists who carry politicians like loose change in their pockets.

And certainly not the way they were framed by Mr. Fink.

He was marketing on CNBC to Indians to open up India to more Western financialization and his products.

That in and of itself is not a bad thing.

But he's doing it at a time when the U.S. way of doing things, specifically the leverage and financialization, which he surreptitiously marketed to listeners as “the multiplier effect” is unwinding in the West and leaving destroyed bridges both domestically and European in its wake.

Leverage grants, in healthy doses, (and accompanied by robust trust in those utilizing such leverage), the ability for a healthy economy to grow.

It can also easily be abused and then become a vehicle for bubble creation, poor risk management, and what I call white-collar welfare, more commonly known as corporate socialism.

BlackRock is one of those companies that, when making loans that went bad, or failed to properly manage its own portfolio risk, asked the Fed to bail it out. The fed of course obliged them, rather than letting the poorly run companies die they vacuumed up their losing trades represented as bonds and ETF portfolios at exorbitant values.

Now, these central banks, having implemented QE to the delight of the world's blackrocks, are taking major portfolio losses. Those losses are going to suck money from infrastructure development and social safety nets, at a time when we can not afford to cut back on either and are, in fact expanding them.

Which means, more printing. Which means more inflation. Which means, more crime, poverty, and lowered standards of living. All to bailout the Blackrocks of the world who are moving on to the next town to sell their products.

So when a man like Larry Fink tells you a pet rock hurts capital markets by just sitting there, when people like he were at ground zero for the greatest wealth confiscation in a generation...

A salesman who is a capitalist when he makes money and a socialist when he loses money.

A man who's desperate to sell more product to an opening market as the one he has operated in for decades is now literally crumbling under his “multiplier effect”

Gold is a barometer of trust in the people running things, and from where we sit, that trust is starting to run low. All the sales pitches in the world will not make it come back.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;

2024-03-30 16:55:00,"""Long Troubled"" CarePoint New Jersey Hospitals To Undergo Financial Restructuring",https://web.archive.org/web/20240331133044/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/long-troubled-carepoint-new-jersey-hospitals-undergo-financial-restructuring,"It looks like high interest rate market shocks and the commercial real estate dumpster fire have only just begun. The latest example of volatility comes from New Jersey hospital operator CarePoint Health.

The operator owns three hospitals, including the 261-bed Bayonne Medical Center, as well as Hoboken University Medical Center and Christ Hospital in Jersey City, according toBloomberg/Yahoo Finance.

Michigan-basedInsighthas stepped in to try and help financially stabilize the network and then rebrand under theInsightname.

Dr. Achintya Moulick, CarePoint’s chief executive officer said last week: “Throughout these past challenging months, CarePoint Health has remained resolute and focused on its mission of providing excellent patient-centered care to the people of Hudson County, and our collaboration with the Insight team has been extraordinarily helpful.”

Moulickcontinued: “Ensuring that our system’s safety net hospitals receive the investment they need to operate sustainably both now and well into the future remains our top priority, and we are exploring various options to meet that goal.”

The report notes that hospitals continue to face high costs for staffing and supplies, impacting even renowned institutions. The financial strain is particularly acute for facilities like CarePoint, which serve a larger proportion of lower-income patients and consequently receive lower reimbursements from government programs compared to private insurers.

The challenges at CarePoint serve as a prime example,Yahoo writes. The New Jersey Department of Health has provided almost $8.4 million in support since mid-February to assist the hospital system with payroll needs and to appoint a chief restructuring officer to aid in its financial recovery.

Insight’s Chief Strategy Officer Atif Bawahab added: “We’ve been in this situation before and we do have a strong sense of optimism for these hospitals to continue to stay open. But at the same time, we do have to make changes, and those changes will take some time.”

Insight acquired Chicago's oldest hospital, Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, from bankruptcy in 2021, preventing its closure. This move by Insight, known for its focus on neurosurgery, orthopedics, and sports medicine, was followed by the purchase of a closed rural hospital in Iowa.

Concerned by CarePoint's financial situation, the New Jersey Department of Health appointed a monitor in January and recently required CarePoint's hospitals to develop emergency plans for potential closures or service halts. CarePoint reported a $68 million loss last year, and several vendors have sued for unpaid bills.

CarePoint has faced financial difficulties for some time. Attempts to sell its Jersey City and Hoboken hospitals to RWJ Barnabas Health fell through in 2019.

2024-03-30 17:30:00,America's Ongoing Death-By-A-Thousand-Cuts,https://web.archive.org/web/20240331133044/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/americas-ongoing-death-thousand-cuts,"Authored by James Howard Kunstler via Kunstler.com,

“A modern nuc can fit in the trunk of a compact car. When millions of people can walk across our border with impunity what do you think the chances are we would catch something that size?”

- Sam Faddis, Retired CIA

Who was not impressed seeing the sudden and total collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge after getting its pylon bonked by the container shipDalia few hours before the dawn’s early light in Baltimore harbor?In America’s ongoing death-of-a-thousand-cuts, that one literally severed a major artery, but it may take a while to know how badly the wounded colossus known as the USA is bleeding out.

""Joe Biden” emerged from his crypt pronto to state that the federal government would pony-up the cost of building the bridge back better, meant to reassure the public, you’d suppose. But perhaps the real reason was to obviate an otherwise requisite investigation of the crash by ship-owner Grace Ocean’s insurance company — since legal wrangling over responsibility would add more years to the already years-long estimated bridge replacement time-frame.And Gawd knows what else they might discover about how the darn thing came to pass. . . rumors of a Ukrainian captain at theDali’shelm. . . stuff that the ruling intel blob might not want to getout there,especially given the still-murky role of the joint USA-UK black-op blobs in the Moscow Crocus Theater Massacre just a week earlier.

The Crocus op, you understand, was probably the worst clusterfuckqua Three Stooges blob operational procedure in memory, since four of the six surviving Tajiki shooters were nabbed in a car enroute to the Ukraine border (where they would’ve been whacked into silence, since they failed to martyr themselves at the scene-of-the-crime), and by now had surely sung their hearts out to persuasive interrogators of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) — the take-away being that President VV Putin has got to be mighty pissed-off and itching for revenge. Was the FSK Bridge take-down the first repayment for that, lots of people inside and outside Blob Central were probably wondering?

You’d also have to wonder, qua the bridge disaster itself, about the implied reverberations through the insurance industry.Consider that the insurance industry is a major cog in the machinery of finance and banking, since insurance company reserves are traditionally allocated in supposedly safe sovereign treasury bonds. Liquidations anyone?Maritime insurance was already groaning under the burden of all that monkey-business in the Red Sea, thanks to Houthi rocket and drone attacks on the shipping of Western Civ. Are the banks quaking harder now? Many across Western Civ were already trembling before the FSK Bridge job.

While the awesome spectacle of the bridge collapse traumatized the country, it also brought to mind the fantastic flow of ten-thousand illegal border crossings a day, stage-managed by the “Joe Biden” Homeland Security team.Did you kind of wonder how many in that 10K-a-day flow might be the same species of Central Asian mutts who volunteered to slaughter over 150 (so far) Russian concert-goers?Nobody is checking who they are, you realize. They just step on US soil, get issued smartphones, loaded debit cards, walking-around cash money, airplane and bus tickets and,voila, there they are in your home town tomorrow, looking for something to occupy themselves. Thanks a bunch, Alejandro Mayorkas!

Are you wondering what sort of mayhem they might be capable of unleashing any place from Bangor to Burbank in the weeks and months ahead?(And, while you’re at it, think about all the food processing plant fires, train wrecks, and other mysterious tribulations around the country the past couple of years.) Consider that this very week alone, following the FSK Bridge disaster, absolutely nothing has been done by our government to stem that flow of countless potential saboteurs into the country. The news media isn’t even talking about it (of course).

The prospects might look a bit unnerving, wouldn’t you agree? Things catching fire, blowing up, and falling down here, there, and everywhere. . . more of those thousand cuts adding up.Just maybe, the dazed-and-confused (possibly hypnotized) American public, a.k.a., the “voters,” might put together that “Joe Biden” and the Party of Chaos that owns him, are actually responsible for the on-going take-down of our country.After a certain point — now apparently passed — sheer incompetence is no longer a plausible explanation for what you are seeing.

Oh, one other thing, look out for on-the-ground economic reverberations from the FSK Bridge disaster. For instance, Baltimore is the USA’s top port for importing and exporting automobiles. Also, earth-moving and large farm equipment, fertilizer, lumber, coal, and steel. Other arrangements must be made, for years ahead, considering the trucking links. It’s especially an interruption for trucking between the mid-Atlantic / New England states and much of Dixieland. It will affect the transport of fruits and vegetables to the Washington-Boston corridor.Things are going to cost more and we are already in an inflationary trouble-zone. How will this thunder elsewhere through an economy which, despite the japes of “Joe Biden’s” statisticians, is actively disintegrating?The fluttering wings of this black swan already throw a chill on spring’s incoming zephyrs.

2024-03-30 17:47:40,"MSNBC Diversity Goblin Inverts Reality, Invokes 1984 in Anti-Trump Segment",https://web.archive.org/web/20240331133044/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-03-30/msnbc-diversitytm-goblin-inverts-reality-clumsily-invokes-orwells-1984-anti-trump,"Originally published viaArmageddon Prose:

In a bout of apparent record-breaking shamelessness/lack of self-awareness/a combination thereof, MSNBC Diversity™ turtle Avi Velshi devoted a whole “Banned Book Club” segment — a recurring one on his show in which he plays the role of subversive rebel discussing literature allegedly banned by the “far-right” or whatever — to George Orwell’s1984, without a hint of irony, given that he works for literal state media at the closest thing to the real-world Ministry of Truth outside of North Korea.

Related:Deep State MSNBC Goon Calls For New PATRIOT Act Against 'Domestic Terrorists'

To start, he inverts reality with the premise that Donald Trump is Big Brother, the figurehead of the Inner Party, and then devotes the rest of the segment painfully trying to fit that square peg into a round hole.

I have more respect for Orwell’s work and for the intelligence of theArmageddon Proseaudience to reach so far as to compare Trump to the protagonist anti-hero Winston Smith of the novel — he’s not that character, who is, at any rate, deeply flawed and arguably not worthy of admiration or imitation — but he’scertainlynot Big Brother in this little melodrama of life imitating art.

For one thing, the movement Trump ostensibly represents, the insurrectionist “far-right” Deplorable faction or whatever it might be called (it has many names and is loosely defined), is not the political faction in control of the government. In fact,the exact inverseis true; the full force of the Deep State, which the corporate media now acknowledges exists, is aimed squarely at this faction. The narrative propagated here is very confused; political movements don’t run “insurrections” when they are the ones in charge.

Related:Breaking Down the ‘Deep State Is Awesome’ Corporate Media Rebrand

In a meta bit of irony, what the Diversity™ Turtle is doing here is, in fact, in keeping with the ethos of the Ministry of Truth that he works for.

“Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.”-George Orwell, 1984

“The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. These contradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from from ordinary hypocrisy: they are deliberate exercises in doublethink”-George Orwell, 1984

The corporate state, aided and abetted by its media appendages like MSNBC — even though the entire theoretical value of the Fifth Estate is to serve as an outside, adversarial check on state power — is the entity, not Donald Trump, that abuses governmental power to censor and abuse political opponents on an industrial scale.

“TheDisinformation Governance Board— a small group created to work on a complicated problem — has become a big headache…

The Senate confirmed Alejandro Mayorkas as DHS secretary on Feb. 2, 2021. In his confirmation hearing, held just two weeks after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, he promised to take on domestic violent extremism, calling it ‘one of the greatest challenges that theDepartment of Homeland Securityconfronts.’”

“Disinformation Governance Board,” “Department of Homeland Security”: these are Inner Party Newspeak monikers that might as well have been ripped straight from the pages of1984.

It is the Velshi’s own network, not Trump or MAGA, that polices what literature the public is permitted to read and what it is not, that cartoonishly slanders its political opponents in the most hyperbolic terms, that broadcasts the Two Minutes Hate depicted in the novel.

“The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic.”-George Orwell, 1984

The analogies between the corporate state and its media outlets and the Inner Party and Ministry of Truth, respectively, could go on ad nauseam. One need only basic reading comprehension skills and a copy of1984to discover this essential truth.

The purpose of this Diversity™ Turtle’s nonsense is not just to throw red-meat propaganda to the rabid, dwindling neoliberal base that consumes MSNBC — which becomesprogressivelymore fanatical and insular over time — but to sow enough confusion into the broader population that the truth becomes too muddled and confused to sort through.

To that end, furthermore, effective propaganda is not a one-off thing; it’s a grueling, nonstop campaign to beat a narrative into the target’s head, over and over and over, until repetition substitutes for a compelling argument. People are subconsciously wired to assume the thing they’ve heard 100 times is, by virtue of its pervasiveness, truer than the thing they heard once.

This is why you will note that same narrative, packaged in virtually the same language verbatim — like that Trump is literally Hitler — parroted over and over and over again in controlled media until it’s cemented in the zeitgeist.

According to the White House:

""NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by theConstitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31, 2024, as Transgender Day of Visibility. I call upon all Americans to join us in lifting up the lives and voices of transgender people throughout our Nation and to work toward eliminating violence and discrimination based on gender identity,"" the statement read.

And where Easter is typically held the first Sunday after the full moon occurs on or after the spring equinox, while ""Transgender Day of Visibility"" is on the same date each year, many have taken offense to the day's proximity to the Christian holiday.

They hate us and our Christianity.

Declaring EASTER to be'Transgender Day of Visibility'Translation:They Hate YouThey Hate Our ChildrenThey Hate Christians .....They Hate America !!!We the People see you 🤛🏼

As for the White House's Easter egg design submission...

""The Submission must not include any questionable content, religious symbols, overtly religious themes,"" a flyer with instructions from the White House stated.

But, of course, the White House is fine with this...

Former President Trump wasn't thrilled with the woke activism coming from the White House:

Putting aside whatever views one may have on transgenderism, why would you overshadow one of the holiest Christian days of the year to promote another ideology/movement of any kind?Aren’t there already other days on the calendar acknowledging/celebrating transgenderism?Why…https://t.co/HZmgQawYtL

The radicals in the White House might have overplayed their hand in their crusade against Christianity, aseven the most left-leaning centralists are appalled by Biden's new declaration.

This seems to be a miscalculated move as blowback nears.

2024-03-30 18:10:00,Judge Rebukes DOJ Arguments Against Release Of Jan. 6 Defendant,https://web.archive.org/web/20240331133044/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/judge-rebukes-doj-arguments-against-release-jan-6-defendant#comment-stream,"Authored by Chase Smith via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

A Jan. 6 defendant seeking to be released from prison was granted in part by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia this week.

The order, signed by U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden on March 26, will grant (pdf) the release of Kevin Seefried, a defendant convicted for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol breach, pending the appeal of his conviction.

This decision comes despite stark warnings from the Justice Department regarding the implications of such a move.

Mr. Seefried received a three-year prison sentence for obstructing an official proceeding among other charges, facing a potential maximum sentence of 23 years.

After his conviction, he appealed and requested release pending appeal,a request that gained new relevance when the Supreme Court decided to review a related case, Fischer v. United States, which could impact many Jan. 6 defendants.

The high Court’s decision on this case may influence the outcome of Mr. Seefried’s conviction, suggesting it could be vacated depending on the justices’ ruling.

The decision to release Mr. Seefried is grounded in the ongoing legal debate over the application of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c), the obstruction of an official proceeding statute, beyond the context of “evidence impairment.”

“Seefried’s current motion is déjà vu all over again,” Judge McFadden wrote.

This legal question is currently under review by the Supreme Court in a related case, Fischer v. United States, which directly challenges the scope of § 1512(c) and its application to the Jan. 6 defendants.

Judge McFadden, in his memorandum order, outlined that the release is premised on two conditions mandated by 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b): a defendant is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the community if released, and that the appeal raises a substantial question likely to result in a significantly lesser sentence or reversal.

Judge McFadden found that Mr. Seefried met both conditions, noting a lack of evidence to suggest Mr. Seefried would flee or pose a danger, and that the Supreme Court’s review of Fischer represents a substantial question of law that could materially affect Mr. Seefried’s conviction.

Judge McFadden noted the argument of the Justice Department that, in their belief, he now knew the “day-to-day reality of confinement in prison” and was therefore “more likely” to flee than return to prison.

Judge McFadden also noted U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves’s argument of 2024 being an election year involving “what will likely be another fiercely contested presidential election” and if released, the Court “would be releasing defendant into the same political maelstrom that led him to commit his crimes in the first place.”

Judge McFadden said those arguments were “unavailing.”

“The riot on January 6th was the culmination of a unique—indeed, never-before-seen—confluence of events,” Judge McFadden wrote. “The Government provides the Court no evidence suggesting that any of the events that led to that riot are reasonably likely to recur. Nor does it point to any evidence that Seefried would participate in another riot if they did.”

Furthermore, the decision reflects on the procedural aspects and standards for release pending appeal, challenging the Justice Department’s arguments against Mr. Seefried’s release.

Judge McFadden wrote he should be released on the one-year anniversary that he first surrendered himself to serve time, which is “on or before” May 31.

2024-03-30 18:40:00,Payment Processor Stripe Backs Off Dr. Malone After Legal Threat,https://web.archive.org/web/20240331133044/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/payment-processor-stripe-backs-dr-malone-after-legal-threat#comment-stream,"Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Stripe, the only payment processor Substack writers can use, has backed off a demand that Dr. Robert Malone link his bank account, according to the law firm Dr. Malone retained.

Stripe earlier in March asked Dr. Malone, who hasan EpochTV show, to “link the primary bank account for your business to your Stripe account,”which would enable Stripe to review the account’s “current account balance and transactions, as well as historical transactions,”according to emails reviewed by The Epoch Times.

The request was part of “a routine credit review” of Dr. Malone’s Substack, one email stated.

Stripe said that if the bank account was not linked, then it might block Dr. Malone from being paid.

The request “which deviated from Stripe’s standard operating procedures, would have compelled Dr. Malone to provide extensive financial information from his business banking activities, including transactions and account balances spanning the entire history of his business bank account,” Dhillon Law Group, which Dr. Malone hired to represent him in the matter, said in a statement.

After the legal firm reached out to Stripe, the company rescinded the demand,the law firm said.

“Financial service providers must tread carefully when requesting client data. It is critical to uphold the delicate balance between regulatory requirements and an individual’s right to financial privacy,” Mark Meuser, an attorney with the group, said in a statement. “We are satisfied with Stripe’s decision to withdraw its request, allowing Dr. Malone to continue his valuable work without unnecessary intrusion into his business affairs.”

Stripe has not responded to requests for comment. A Stripe spokesperson toldThe Federalist, “Stripe may, in certain instances, request users to link their bank account to assess businesses’ liquidity as part of the underwriting process, but also allows businesses to submit a form with relevant information in lieu of linking their bank account.”

That alternative was not presented to Dr. Malone, according to his lawyers.

Dr. Malone saidretaining lawyers was expensive but a move he felt he had to make after neither Stripe nor Substack provided any options other than linking his account.

“It was a hard and costly decision to justify this level of cost and risk,but the risk of losing a business that had been developed over years of careful, daily customer service was too high to not take this seriously,” he wroteon his Substack.

The result was the disclosure that, instead of linking his account, Dr. Malone could provide certain information on a form. The form requested information on which services Dr. Malone is selling through Stripe, and whether Dr. Malone accepts payments from customers before the customers receive the services, according to a screenshot of the document.

“In my opinion,it is very unfortunate that Stripe and Substack are pursuing these policies, which are absolutely contrary to the principles of support of free speech upon which Substack was founded. Stripe has apparently modified those web-based resources in which they has [sic] previously indicated that this policy was being implemented in response to Federal US Government pressure to delete any reference to Federal US Government actions prompting these policies,” Dr. Malone wrote.

Dr. Malone was referring to a recent U.S. House of Representatives report thatdetailedhow the U.S. government is conducting surveillance of financial providers, although neither Stripe nor Substack were mentioned in the report.

Substack responded in an automatic message to an inquiry, stating, “If you’re a journalist reaching out with a press request, a member of our communications team will be in touch.” No Substack employees ever responded to the inquiry.

“In this case, we were able to obtain prompt revision of the Stripe/Substack action by spending considerable funds to obtain highly qualified legal representation,” Dr. Malone said. “But what of the average author who is either caught unaware by such policies or who cannot justify such legal costs? This appears to be a new normal, weaponization of finance and financial transactions to restrict and control free speech.”

2024-03-30 19:15:00,Gen-Z American YouTuber Kidnapped In Haiti,https://web.archive.org/web/20240331133044/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/gen-z-american-youtuber-kidnapped-haiti#comment-stream,"A YouTube and Twitch star known as""YourFellowArab""was reportedly kidnapped by a ruthless Haitian gang. The Gen-Zer attempted to interview gang leader Jimmy 'Barbecue' Cherizier earlier this month amid theCaribbean nation's descent into civil war.

Local media outletHaiti24reports Addison Pierre Maalouf traveled from his home in Atlanta to interview Barbecue, the leader of the G9 Family and Allies, abbreviated as ""G9"" or ""FRG9"", a coalition of over a dozen Haitian gangs based in Port-au-Prince.

But on March 14, the YouTuber was kidnapped by a group of armed men from the ""400 Mawozo"" gang.

The incident took place when he was returning from Cap-Haïtien, accompanied by his Haitian colleague, Sacra Sean. Adisson Pierre Maalouf went to Delmas 6 to do an interview with Jimmy Cerisier, aka ""Barbecue,"" a spokesperson for Viv Ansanm.

The outlet continued:

According to information, the kidnappers, acting under the orders of the fearsome gang leader ""Lanmò 100 jou"", member of the ""Viv Ansanm"" coalition, demanded an exorbitant ransom of $600,000 for the journalist's release. Despite the payment of an initial tranche of $40,000, the kidnappers demanded a much larger sum for his complete release.

Addison makes videos about his experiences with gangsters all over the world. In one recent video, he lived with the Mexican cartel for days. He's hunted pirates in the Red Sea and toured the favelas in Rio de Janeiro.

Earlier this month, the US Embassy in Port-au-Prince urged all American citizens still in the country to ""leave as soon as possible"" while other embassies restricted services. The US State Department placed the nation on the ""Do not travel"" list for Americans.

Another Twitch streamer,Lalem, said on X, ""Tried keeping it [kidnapping] private for 2 weeks, but it's getting out everywhere now. Yes Arab has been kidnapped in Haiti, and we're working on getting him out. Love ya'll, he'll be out soon.""

Here are some of the YouTuber's last posts on X:

Going on another one of those trips 🤫If I die, thanks for watching what I’ve put out. If I live, all glory to God.

My taxi just got in an accident in the middle of the Dominican while I was asleep.Everything good, just another sign that God is watching over 🙏🏻pic.twitter.com/NeQAQNryqY

Dominican Republicans are by far the worst drivers in the entire world.Worse than Indians, worse than Asians, worst in the world 🇩🇴

Imagine all the shit I’ve done that should’ve killed me & I die to a car accident 😂I’d be the biggest pussy of all time. Light scratches keep moving.

Youngsters will do anything for those clicks...

U.S. cases of tuberculosis, a deadly infectious disease that typically strikes the lungs, have soared to their highest level in a decade,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with the largest relative increase among children.

After 27 years of declining tuberculosis rates in the United States, cases of the disease started to climb again in 2020—and they’ve continued to rise every year since, the CDC said in aMarch 28 report.

In 2023, tuberculosis case counts jumped by 1,295 from the prior year to 9,615, the agency said. This represents an increase of 16 percent and is the highest level since 2013.

While the CDC expected cases to rise,the extent of the increase came as somewhat of a surprise to the agency.

Dr. Philip LoBue, director of the CDC’s Division of Tuberculosis Elimination, told The Associated Press that the 2023 case count was “a little more” than expected.

Tuberculosis incidences increased in every age group in 2023 compared to the year prior, but for reasons unknown children aged 5–14 experienced the largest relative increase—42 percent.

The vast majority—76 percent—of tuberculosis cases in the United States in 2023 were in non-U.S.-born persons.

Among 9,573 tuberculosis cases in persons for whom birth origin was known, 7,259 occurred among those who were born outside the United States, the CDC said. This represents an 18 percent increase compared to 2022.

Tuberculosis, which is caused by a bacteria that typically attacks the lungs, is one of the deadliest infectious diseases in the world.

Nearly 4,400 people globally die each day from tuberculosis, which is spread through the air when someone is infected with the disease sneezes or coughs.

The United States has one of the lowest rates of tuberculosis in the world, but the CDC said in its report that the uptick in cases means that capacity should be strengthened in public health programs to carry out “critical disease control and prevention strategies.”

As was the case in 2022, California reported the highest number of tuberculosis cases in 2023, with 2,113 infections.

Alaska reported the highest infection rate, at 10.6 per 100,000 people.

An estimated 85 percent of the people counted in 2023 were infected at least a year or two earlier and had what’s known as latent tuberculosis.This is when the bacteria enters the body and hibernates in the lungs or other parts of the body, and then becomes reactivated.

Health experts estimate as many as 13 million Americans have latent tuberculosis. People with latent tuberculosis don’t feel sick or have any symptoms, nor can they spread the bacteria to others.

The CDC says that, in order to prevent transmission and reduce fatalities, the disease must be detected quickly and treatment must be initated promptly.

Last November, California health officialssaid thatat least 10 cases of tuberculosis were linked to a casino in Contra Costa County.

“TB can live inside someone for years without showing signs of its presence,” Dr. Meera Sreenivasan said of the disease, according to an earlier report from The Epoch Times.

“That is why it’s important to take a test, even if you do not feel sick. TB can cause serious illness, but it is treatable and curable with medicine, especially when caught early,” he added.

In anotherwidely reportedincident, an outbreak of tuberculosis cases at a migrant shelter on Cape Cod was the subject of an alleged coverup.

Tuberculosiscan be categorizedinto different types based on its stage (active versus latent) and the part of the body it affects (lungs or outside the lungs), with the two main categories being pulmonary and extrapulmonary.

Pulmonary tuberculosis is an infection involving the lungs, though this form of the disease can also spread to other organs.

Extrapulmonary tuberculosis originates in organs outside the lungs and never enters the lungs. This type often arises from the spread of infection through the bloodstream or directly from other organs. Unlike the type that involves the lungs,extrapulmonary tuberculosis is generally not contagious.

While latent tuberculosis is asymptomatic, people with the active form of the disease typically have symptoms that include chills, fever, profuse night sweats, weight loss, general malaise, loss of appetite, weakness, and fatigue.

Pulmonary tuberculosis also often involves difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent cough lasting over three weeks, swollen glands, and sore throat.

US debt is rising by $1 trillion every 3 months... and US interest expense is rising by $100 billion every 4 months.https://t.co/D2Nkf1WkP2

It didn't take long for this original observation to make its way to our favorite Wall Street strategist, BofA CIO Michael Hartnett, who in his latest Flow Show note dedicated his entire ""Biggest Picture"" segment to - you guessed it - the quantum leap higher in interest expense, which also Hartnett correctly notes is a ""big motivation"" for Powell to cut rates to ""constrain the surge in interest costs"" which he amusingly calls ""Interest Cost Control"" policy, borrowing another term we have sporadically used on this website.

As the 2024 election heats up, now is the time for campaigns to invest wisely.Questions abound: Do you invest in cable news advertising? Door-to-door canvassing? Social media? Something else?

For answers, I look back to the past. In 2000, I oversaw the South Carolina Republican Party’s history-making effort to post real-time presidential primary results online. The election night vote-counting for the epic Bush vs. McCain battle played out on screens across the world – not just in the South Carolina GOP’s vote tabulation center. On that night, the ground shifted beneath our feet.

Over more than two decades of working on Senator Lindsey Graham’s campaigns, first as his finance director and then as his campaign manager for multiple elections, I watched digital operations transform from a backwater oddity to the beating heart of modern campaigns. To outsiders, this revolution seemed obvious, given the meteoric rise of social media, data collection, and mobile devices. However,for an industry steeped in “retail politics” that values handshakes, parades, and stump speeches, embracing the Internet’s intangible nature was a massive culture shock.

Many candidates didn’t understand the social media platforms that can decide elections, and many still don’t. But the digitization of politics is now undeniable, with digital ad spending alone expected to increase byabout 30%in 2024. Billions of political dollars are now spent on digital ads without even taking into account the organic reach of a given candidate.

The tide turned when digital proved it could raise money.In the early 2000s, campaigns dabbled with websites and a few email donations.Digital was seen as a minor complement to traditional fundraising, not a replacement. Today, large grassroots-fueled campaigns often generate a majority of their funding from small-dollar donors. In fact, we raised a whopping 84% of Senator Graham’s record-breaking $110 million in 2020 from generous digital and direct mail donors. Again, we felt the ground shift beneath our feet.

But fundraising is only the tip of the iceberg. The Obama campaign’s pioneering use of technology in 2008 opened the floodgates, reaching more voters, organizing more efficiently, and raising more money thanks to an unmatched digital operation. Fast forward to 2024, and digital is intertwined with every aspect of a political campaign.

Want to recruit volunteers or distribute yard signs? Utilize your website and social media. Need to map out the most effective door-knocking routes? There’s an app for that. Want to encourage donations during a debate? Send out a text. Looking to target voters on social media and streaming TV? Digital advertising has it covered.“Retail politics” still happens in person, but campaigns are now powered by data and analytics. Digital rules behind the scenes.

The central role of digital highlights one of its most critical values: Real-time metrics. Digital is the canary in the coal mine, detecting a message’s effectiveness long before polls or pundits reflect it. If a strategy shows early success, data quantifies and scales it. If you’re falling behind the metrics, your campaign is doomed. We saw this real-time impact in 2020 when Senator Graham raised over $5 million in only 24 hours due, in part, to standing up for then-Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett. On that day, the ground again shifted beneath our feet.

In 2024 and beyond, the digital team can no longer be siloed off.It must be fully integrated into every aspect of a winning campaign, so digital should be part of every strategic decision through constant collaboration. Future campaigns will be won or lost based on which candidates have digital in their DNA – and invest in it. Leaders who fail to embrace this truth do so at their own peril.

2024-03-30 21:35:00,Black Mayors Hold National Meeting On Crime - Discussion Closed To The Public,https://web.archive.org/web/20240331133044/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/black-mayors-hold-national-meeting-rising-crime-discussion-closed-public,"The ""Black Mayors' Coalition on Crime"" gathered this week in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss the dangers of crime across the US, as well as apparent solutions to the growing threat.  The question is, was the meeting really about stopping crime, or, was it all about maintaining optics and making the public believe crime is going down when it's not?

It's difficult to say because public and media access to the event was strictly limited.  In many states private meetings between public officials related to policy are illegal.  However, in Tennessee the regulations are a bit more lax in terms of what constitutes a ""meeting subject to law.""

The Tennessee Open Meetings Act defines a “meeting” as “the convening of a governing body of a public body for which a quorum is required to make a decision or to deliberate toward a decision.” A “governing body” is “any public body [consisting] of two or more members, with the authority to make decisions for or recommendations to a public body on policy or administration.”

In other words, a quorum is required, which means Tennessee was very carefully chosen by the Black Mayor's Coalition (the vast majority of them Democrats) because it allowed them more legal room to hold closed door meetings.  But why not include the press and the public in this discourse?

Perhaps because the event is in itself an admission that crime is rising; a reality which Democrat representatives have tried to deny for the past few years.  Another reason may be because the solutions being discussed are not something the voting population would agree with.

In the interview below the Mayor of St. Louis,Tishaura Jones, mentions that gas stations and convenience stores attract a high rate of crime and asks how the business owners can be 'held accountable' for this, rather than how they can be protected from it?

“We have a lot of violence around convenience stores and gas stations...So how can we hold those business owners accountable and also bring down crime? Some of the things are already doing, we’re finding other mayors are doing as well.”

In other words, how can these mayors blame businesses for the crime rate instead of taking responsibility as elected representatives?

There are the obvious ironies to mention here, including the fact that many of these mayors supported far-left measures to defund police departments, only to quietly remove those measures a few years later.  Then there's the plethora of statistical tricks used by city politicians to hide real crime data.

This includes greatly reduced prosecution and conviction rates; in many Democrat controlled cities the conviction rate is less than 5 out of every 100 arrests.  From 2018 to 2023, conviction ratesdropped over 58%, and convictions sharply declined specifically from 2020 onward.  From 2011 to 2021 prison populations dropped over 22%, despite the fact that criminal activityincreased over the same period.

The less prosecutions, the less convictions, the lower the crime stats.  It's that simple.  Democrats have also taken advantage of a change in the FBI criminal reporting policies which was conveniently initiated in 2020.  Because of this change, numerous US cities will not be reporting full numbers to the FBI until 2025.  This is why the FBI recently reported a ""drop"" in violent crime nationally - Because theydon't have complete statistics.

Then of course there's the disproportionate number of crimes committed by minorities in these same cities.  Black on black crime rates in places like St. Louis are stunning.Studies from 2022show that 92% of homicide suspects and 86% of victims in St. Louis and St. Louis County were black.  Around 84% of them were repeat offenders.  Blacks make up 43% of the population in that region.

Leftist mayors have long suggested that public perception of crime deviates from the reality of crime; yet, here they are holding closed-door meetings to discuss the growing crime problem in their own towns.  Perhaps the issue is not public perception mismatching reality,  maybe the issue is political spin mismatching reality.  The populace deals with these crimes on a daily basis; it's going to be hard to gaslight people into thinking criminal activity isn't a problem.

2024-03-30 22:10:00,Behind Massive Mail-In Ballot Push Is A Little-Noticed Executive Order,https://web.archive.org/web/20240331133044/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/behind-massive-mail-ballot-push-little-noticed-executive-order,"Authored by Kevin Stocklin via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

A federal effort to register voters using the government’s vast reach, including throughout the U.S. prison system, is raising concerns from criticswho have said it won’t benefit Democrats and Republicans equally.

Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson wrote to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on March 6 alleging that agencies under the attorney general’s charge are “attempting to register people to vote, including potentially ineligible felons, and to co-opt state and local officials into accomplishing this goal.”

The allegation relates to President Joe Biden’sExecutive Order 14019, which states, “The head of each agency shall evaluate ways in which the agency can, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, promote voter registration and voter participation.”

Among other things, this order has forced U.S. Marshals to modify more than 900 contracts with prisons and jails to provide voter registration documents and facilitate mail-in voting for inmates, Mr. Watson wrote.

“We have worked extremely hard to restore the confidence of Mississippi voters in our election process,” Mr. Watson told The Epoch Times. “To have the Biden administration and the DOJ purposefully undermine these efforts and jeopardize the integrity of Mississippi’s elections is unacceptable.”

The secretary of state is the chief election officer in Mississippi.

The work by the Department of Justice to register voters in prisons, critics say, is just the tip of the iceberg.

Other agencies, including the Department of Education, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, are also carrying out campaigns to sign up new voters.

On Feb. 26, Vice President Kamala Harris lauded a federal plan to use work-study grants to pay students to register voters.

In addition, President Biden’s executive order directed federal agencies to select “approved, nonpartisan third-party organizations and state officials to provide voter registration services on agency premises.”

President Biden’s executive order wascalled“visionary“ by Ceridwen Cherry, a former staff attorney on the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Voting Rights Project, who said, ”In a democracy, governments at all levels should be doing everything they can to help eligible people register to vote.”

However, critics say elections are under the purview of states, not the federal government.

“The reason it’s such a big problem is that, with the president, it’s only one political party that’s in power,” Stewart Whitson, legal director of the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA), a conservative think-tank, told The Epoch Times.

“If you allow the president to be the one to decide where all these massive resources are channeled, that’s problematic,” he said, adding that this is why the Founders gave election authority to states and not to the federal executive.

The plan has been called “Bidenbucks” by some of its detractors, referencing the injection into state election programs of $400 million in 2020 from Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, dubbed “Zuckerbucks.”

“This is Zuckerbucks on steroids because instead of $400 million, it’s unlimited funding and resources and the reach of the federal government and all its offices located across the country,” Mr. Whitson said.

Previous efforts to federalize elections through Congress have failed.

In 2022, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) attempted to eradicate the legislative filibuster in order to passH.R. 5746, the “Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act,” which would have given the federal government authority over parts of state election systems, expanded voting by mail, and eliminated security protocols such as requiring voter identification.

Democrats claimed the bill was necessary to fight “voter suppression” by state governments.

President Biden’s executive orderincludesthe directive for federal agencies to find ways to distribute “vote-by-mail ballot application forms” as well as assist applicants in completing the application “in a manner consistent with all relevant State laws.”

In 2020,nearly 45 percentof voters used mail-in-ballots.

Since the president signed EO 14019, a number of attempts have been made to obtain information about how federal agencies will implement it, particularly which private organizations it has selected to work out of federal offices alongside government officials.

Federal departments refused to release this information, and requests were followed up with FOIA filings and subsequently by lawsuits; however, the Biden administration continues to defy the requests.

In July 2021, the FGA filed a FOIA request regarding President Biden’s Voting Access plan. The group sought information about what federal agencies were doing to implement the plan, as well as records from planning and strategy meetings among President Biden’s staff, federal agencies, and the architects of EO 14019.

“These documents, in any other context, would be handed over much more quickly,” Mr. Whitson said. “So this indicates to us that there’s something there the Biden administration really does not care to share, because they’ve withheld it for nearly three years now.”

The America First Legal foundation, another plaintiff in a FOIA suit,characterizedEO 14019 as “the president’s unprecedented effort to deploy federal agencies in support of partisan voting operations and fortify politically aligned private organizations working to circumvent state election integrity laws.”

More than two years later, court battles over the information requests are ongoing. The administration has brought in White House counsel and the Department of Justice to fight the requests.

Prominent among the many federal agencies carrying out the executive order is the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which announced in 2022 that federal health centers across the nation now have the discretion to participate in activities—including voter registration—that are outside the scope of core department activities.

“Such voter registration activities may include making available voter registration materials to patients, encouraging patients to register to vote, assisting patients with completing registration forms, sending completed forms to the election authorities, providing voter registration materials in waiting rooms, and allowing private, non-partisan organizations to conduct on-site voter registration,” the HHSwebsitesays.

The Department of Housing and Urban Developmentinstructedmore than 3,000 public housing authorities managing some 1.2 million public housing units across the country to run voter registration drives in those units.

The Department of Education sent aletterto universities, directing them to use Federal Work Study funds “to support voter registration activities.”

The letter states, “If a student is employed directly by a post-secondary institution, the institution may compensate a student for [Federal Work Study] employment involving voter registration activities that take place on or off-campus.”

The Department of Education has been particularly active in turning out likely Democrat voters, according to Scott Walter, president of the Capital Research Center.

“Every college campus is massively dependent on Department of Education largesse, from Pell grants to every other kind of aid,” Mr. Walter told The Epoch Times.

“The Department of Education in 2022 was threatening campuses that you better be registering students or you could lose your federal funds.”

The Department of Agriculture issued letters to state agencies administering the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Women’s Infants and Children’s low-income food program, instructing them to carry out voter registration activities with federal funds.

2024-03-31 00:16:56,Weaponizing The Economy,https://web.archive.org/web/20240401112021/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-03-31/weaponizing-economy,"The main event of last week was likely the""black swan event""that occurred under the spring ""wormy moon"" when the Singapore-flagged vessel Dali destroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. Aside from the drama it brings for those who were on the bridge at the time of the collapse, this event willonce again test the supply chains, which have already suffered from the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea and the drought in the Panama Canal. Baltimore is one of the 9th largest US ports, one of the major ones on the East Coast, and the top US roll-on-roll-off port. Baltimore handled 52.3 million tons of foreign cargo valued at approximately $80.8 billion, ranking ninth in the US for both metrics in 2023. Additionally, the port set a record with 1.1 million 20-foot equivalent unit containers. It alsohandled the most cars and light trucks in the US for the 13th consecutive year, totalling 847,158 vehicles, along with 1.3 million tons of roll-on/roll-off farm and construction machinery. The port was thesecond busiest for coal exports, with eight dry bulk terminals exporting 22 million tonnes of coal, as well as small amounts of other metals and minerals. Other top export commodities includedliquefied natural gas, wastepaper, and ferrous scrap.Cove Point, the LNG terminal, typically exports about 500,000 tonnes per month. Baltimore is alsothe largest American port by volume for handling farm and construction machinery and agricultural products, with imports totalling 3 million tons last year, including sugar, salt, gypsum, fertilizers, and forest products.

Indeed, the port of Baltimore holds ageographic advantageover other larger ports on the East Coast—it is more inland and closer to the Midwest. This proximity is evident in the extensive train lines stretching from the port of Detroit (autos) and Chicago (farm equipment) to Baltimore.

The disruption caused by the ""black swan event"" is expected to particularlyaffect US automotive supply chains, as Mazda Motor, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru of America, Mitsubishi Motors of North America, and Volkswagen Group have significant exposure to the port of Baltimore.

Investors will recall that theauto sector played a pivotal role in driving the ""immaculate disinflation"" narrativein 2023. However, with automakers in Detroit still grappling with significant increases in labour costs following the UAW strikes last year, the US imports approximately a fifth of the cars it consumes. Thedisruption to the auto trade will impede the progress of ""car disinflation.""Despite strides made in disinflation over the past year, new cars and car parts and equipment remain approximately 20% more expensive than before the pandemic.

Thus, while central banks spread ""Forward Confusion"" regarding the path of inflation in the coming months, historically, there has beena 6-month lag between the evolution of the NY Fed Global Supply Chain Pressure Index and the year-over-year change in US CPI.

With rising geopolitical tensions and an outright war between Russia and NATO, the recent weeks have also witnessed a sharp rebound in oil prices, which have just reached a fresh 4-month high. The wave of drone strikes on Russian crude-processing facilities began in January, reflecting Ukraine's full intention to cripple the fuel supply that funds Moscow's war machine.

These drone strikes, some deep within the country's territory, have led to a surge in ""unplanned Russian refinery maintenance."" As a consequence,Russian diesel exports have been declining for weeksfollowing the drone attacks on Russian refineries that began in January.

India, previously benefiting from purchasing discounted Russian crude oil in Rupees and Rubles due to the war in Ukraine, halted acceptance of Russian crude delivered by Sovcomflot-operated tankers last week.Tightened US sanctionsenforcementdisrupted India's significant oil trade with Russia, prompting refiners to seek costlier alternatives, notably from the US. About 1.5 million barrels of Urals crude were shipped so far on Sovcomflot vessels in March, down from 4.4 million barrels in January and 4.7 million barrels in February.

For Europe, the recent escalations in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine have resulted in theEuropean gas price appearing to form a double-bottomaround the EUR25.0 per megawatt-hour level. For investors, aside from being another headwind for the European economy, which has already entered theinflationary bustphase of the business cycle regardless of the ECB rhetoric, it will lead toa weaker EURover time. This depreciation will be inflationary and will also pose additional challenges for those in charge in Brussels and Frankfurt ahead of the European parliamentary elections in June.

As the war in Ukraine rages on,Russia has gained significant momentum, outproducing NATO allies in weaponry due to stalled US funding. Withextra-legal attacks on energy chokepoints becoming normalized, there's a risk of inadvertent escalation, potentially leading to outright war between NATO and Russia.Few investors are prepared for such escalationswhile in the meantime Ukrainians has been targeting Russian refineries and possibly starting a war of terror as the recent events in Moscow indicate. In this context,the weaponization of crude oil could trigger a major financial shock globally, akin to the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis. Moving to the Middle East, Iran's preparations for an 'oil war' add to these risks, as adversaries in the region may weaponize energy.

The key question isno more if butwhen Iran and Russia will employ oil as an economic weaponagainst the West and spread social unrest in the US ahead of the November Presidential election.

The history books remind investors thatthe 1973 oil embargo reshaped the global energy market, geopolitics, and the economy, with inflation soaring to 12% after a brief celebration over lower rates. Recent events in Moscow highlight the vulnerability of major oil producers like Saudi Arabia. With the risk of a 1970s-style stagflation explosion looming, today's economic landscape mirrors that of the 1970s-1980s. Whilefiscal measures and high-net-worth spending have delayed recession, they've also heightened the certainty of inflation in a multipolar world. A geopolitical oil shock, adding to the inflationary pressures of War, could catalyse another global financial crisis akin to the 2008 recession triggered by an oil shock.

The good news, compared to previous periods of weaponized oil, is thatUS crude production is now exceeding 13.0 million barrels per day.

The bad news is that radical climate change warriors in the White House have depleted the SPR and hindered the ability to expand refining capacity. Additionally,recent M&A activity in the US shale patch has resulted in stricter capital expenditure policies. Despite expectations for US oil production to continue increasing while OPEC+ reduces its own, pipeline-implied US L48 crude production has declined by nearly 0.4mb/d since December, reaching 12.6mb/d, with a 160kb/d week-on-week drop according to Genscape data (14DMA). Furthermore, the 3-month moving average of US crude production growth has slowed to 550kb/d YoY, withweakness observed in the Gulf of Mexico.

Therefore, a perfect storm of higher crude prices continues to brew as the world's refineries have become major targets. With all eyes on the Middle East, investors should consider the longer-term perspective.BRICS and their newly joined members accounted for 14.2% and 25.4% of total oil output in 2023, respectively. This suggests that in the emerging bipolar world, outside the US, which is self-sufficient in its oil consumption,its allies may increasingly rely on united BRICS members for their energy supply.

Share of World Crude Oil Exports in 2023.

Not only has supply driven oil prices higher, but alsoChina's January-February activity data exceeded market expectations. Industrial production growth edged up during this period, contrary to market expectations of a slowdown.

Among energy commodities, it's not just oil that has been rising recently. After a pullback lasting roughly four months,the price of uranium futures appears to have hit a bottom and remains significantly above last year's average levels. Investors are turning their attention to uranium's future, driven by an increasing supply shortage and higher demand as nations seek nuclear energy solutions to combat climate change. This interest is underscored bysupply warnings from Canada's Cameco and Kazakhstan's Kazatomprom, the leading producers responsible for half of the worldwide uranium supply. Kazatomprom forecasts a significant supply deficit, escalating from 21 million pounds in 2030 to 147 million pounds by 2040.

Outside of oil and uranium, the Russia/Ukraine/NATO war has underscored the urgent need forgreater food and energy security among the US, Europe, and Asia.Russia is the second/third largest producer of natural gas and oil, while Ukraine ranks fourth/fifth in maize and wheat production. The pandemic, war, and deglobalization have all contributed tohigher inflation and bond yields. However, they have also served as catalysts for economic growth in the US, Europe, and Asia. Governments are investing in defense spending, imposing tech restrictions, and enhancing domestic supply chains to ensure the security of food, energy, and technology supply chains in the 2020s.

This is not to mention thecocoa supply-driven hyperinflationthat emerged just in time for Easter. The cocoa market has been suffering from poor harvests due to adverse weather conditions and crop diseases across West Africa, the world's top cocoa-growing region. In addition to the weather challenges, countries like Ghana, the world's second-largest cocoa grower, are poised tolose access to a key funding facilitydue to a crisis in its cocoa crop, leaving it without enough beans to secure financing.

Similar to food and energy,semiconductors—essential components of modern technology, particularly artificial intelligence—have become a major focus of economic protectionism.In August 2022, the US passed the CHIPS Act to boost domestic chip production and expanded restrictions on chip exports to China in October 2023. Major semiconductor producers such as Taiwan, the US, Japan, South Korea, and China have historically relied heavily on each other for different types of chips, with China being a significant importer. In 2021, South Korea exported $90 billion worth of chips to China, Taiwan exported $52 billion, the US exported $13 billion, and Japan $12 billion.Tech and semiconductors have now become tools of geopolitical policy, with technology being considered a national security sector for advanced economies.

Investors should bear in mind thatEurope has a long history of conflict, with the Russia/Ukraine NATO war being just one of many, marking the 487thmilitary conflict in Europe over the past 2000 years. With Europe's increasing dependence on China and the US for security, as well as on Russia for energy,capital outflows are likely to accelerate once again in the coming months as geopolitical tensions on the ground worsen.

The decision of the European Union to seize the profits from frozen Russian assets and to use them to finance the war economy to support Ukraine shows that once again incompetent politicians are taking decisions which are opening a new pandora box and willthreaten the stability of the European financial systemoutside the challenges created by the current conflict.

2024-03-31 07:00:00,Destruction Of American-Made M1 Abrams Tanks Is A Sign Of Ukrainian Desperation,https://web.archive.org/web/20240331133044/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/destruction-american-made-m1-abrams-tanks-sign-ukrainian-desperation,"Authored by Mike Fredenburg via The Epoch Times,

Thirty-one M1 Abrams tanks were delivered to Ukraine inSeptember/October of 2023only to effectively disappear from the news for about four months.Now with the reported destruction of thefourth M1 Abrams tankin a span of 12 days, they are back in the news. And the fact they are back in the news is a sign of how desperate things are for Ukraine.

There are a number of plausible reasons that Ukraine did not deploy the Abrams and theirfreshly trained crewsto the frontlines until justrecently, and none of them are mutually exclusive.

First, while a properly supported M1 Abrams is very effective, it is highly maintenance intensive and guzzles gas. So, before they could be used at all effectively, the proper support infrastructure and logistics needed to be in place. Also, by the time the Abrams could be properly supported by Ukraine, it was facing heavily fortified lines that included tank traps, trenches, tank-killing drones, massed artillery fires, and minefields that have proved devastating to Ukraine’s other tanks. And withthe failure of Ukraine’s counteroffensive, it made sense to keep the gas-hungry/maintenance-intensive Abrams in reserve for defensive operations when Russia inevitably began its own offensive operations.

All of the above reasons are legitimate, butarguably the biggest reason may be that it was believed by Ukraine and the Biden administration that the propaganda value Russia would reap from their destruction was far greater than any value they would bring to Ukraine in uselessly throwing them against the fierce anddevastatingly effective defensesof theSurovikin Line.

That Russia recognized the propaganda value of destroying Western “wonder weapons” is demonstrated by itscreation of tank-killer groups (TKGs)whose focus is destroying and/or capturing any modern armor provided to Kyiv by the United States and its NATO allies.

To encourage the TKGs, Russian businesses and officials reportedly offeredcash bounties for the destruction of Western military equipmentin Ukraine. Aleksandr Osipov, the governor of Russia’s Zabaikalsky Region, reportedly signed an order in January 2023 promising local soldiers 3 million rubles ($37,000) for capturing an operational Leopard 2 tank, or 1 million rubles ($12,000) for destroying one. Fores, a Russian chemical manufacturing company, issued a press release stating that “Fores will pay 5 million rubles[$70,700 U.S.] for the first trophy. The payment for every next one [Leopard 2 or Abrams] … will be 500,000 rubles [$7,070 U.S.].”

With Russians paying special attention to the Abrams, it is not hard to imagine that Ukraine and the Biden administration quickly agreed that rushing the “game-changing” Abrams into lethal environs to become propaganda fodder was not the favored course of action.

However, with the devastating losses in men and materiel suffered by Ukraine, Ukraine is running low on everything,including ammunition, men, morale—and tanks. And with Russia having shifted from conservation of forces operations to limited offensive operations, denying fodder for Russia propaganda has taken a back seat to battlefield realities, and Ukraine is desperately throwing everything it has into defensive operations to slow down Russian advances. And that everything includes the 31 Abrams.

How the Abrams were destroyed illustrates why the Ukraine-Russian battlefield is arguably the most hostile environment for tanks ever.According to unverified reports from Russian media, the first Abrams was destroyed when it came under attack by units of the Samara 15th Motorized Rifle Brigade after being spotted by a reconnaissance drone. First it was struck by a kamikaze drone and then finished off by grenade launchers. Thesecond Abrams was put out of actionby Russia’s Army Group Center, which successfully used two first-person-view unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The third Abrams was lost in battleto a T-72B3 main battle tankthat used its powerful gun-fired anti-tank missile, something Abrams do not have, to take out the Abrams with a single shot. The fourth Abrams tank looks like it wasdestroyed by artillery.

The use of the gun-fired anti-tank missiles such asthe 9M119M Refleks, which is standard on advanced T-72 tanks, including the T-72B3 and thehighly cost-effective T-90M, allows Russian tanks to outrange Abrams and get in the first shot.This capability illustrates the fact that modernized T-72 tanks, when properly employed and supported, are a threat to even the most advanced of Western tanks.

As was to be expected, the destruction of the M1 Abrams tanks has beentrumpeted by Russian mediaand social media. But given that bothChallengerandLeopard 2tanks have been destroyed in the last few months, and that Ukrainianmorale is already low, losing the Abrams at this stage of the war probably had less impact than if they had been destroyed shortly after arriving in Ukraine.

Still, havingthree M1 Abrams tanks destroyedin just over a week, and thefourth destroyedwithin a 12-day span, did provide a boost for Russian morale that Ukraine and the United States would dearly love to have avoided.

2024-03-31 07:35:00,Concern Over Food & Water Supply Grows Among Europeans,https://web.archive.org/web/20240331133044/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/concern-over-food-water-supply-grows-among-europeans#comment-stream,"Spain’s northeastCatalonia region is currently suffering its worst drought on record.

And, as Statista's Anna Fleck reports, it’s not just Spain afflicted with this problem: TheEU Commission’s Joint Research Center sounded the alarm earlier this year over how prolonged drought eventshave affected Europe for more than two years already and northern Africa for as many as six, which is“causing water shortages and hampering vegetation growth.”

Food and water supplies were not considered a particular issue among Europeans for a long time. But new data illustrates how that is starting to change.

According to asurveyby Statista’s Consumer Insights, as many as one in four respondents in France said that food and water security was one of the biggest challenges their country faced in 2023.

The proportion was similarly high in the United Kingdom (24 percent), Spain (24 percent) and Italy (23 percent).

In all four polled countries supply security has become a more widespread concern with each passing year.

2024-03-31 08:10:00,Globalists Claim Mass Immigration Helps The US Economy – Here's Why That's A Lie,https://web.archive.org/web/20240331133044/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/globalists-claim-mass-immigration-helps-us-economy-heres-why-thats-li#comment-stream,"Authored by Brandon Smith via Alt-Market.us,

I have said it many times in the past but I think it bears repeating once again:If you want to understand why world events happen the way they do, you must understand the goals and influence of globalist institutions.You must accept the fact that these people create most of the national and international disasters you and I have to deal with on a regular basis and oftentimes they create these disasters deliberately.

Yes, I know, there are plenty of skeptics out there that think all geopolitics and crisis events are random or a product of bureaucratic stupidity; and those people are wrong.They have no idea what they’re talking about because they’re basing this conclusion on assumptions rather than facts and research. Make no mistake, there’s a good reason why it feels like the whole world has gone crazy all at once.

The primary purpose of the globalists is to erase national borders and homogenize all countries and cultures under one economic and governmental system. They have openly admitted to this plan on numerous occasions. One of the most revealing quotes on the agenda comes from Clinton Administration Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbot, who statedin Time magazinethat:

“In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single, global authority… National sovereignty wasn’t such a great idea after all.”

He adds in the same article a lesser known quote:

“…The free world formed multilateral financial institutions that depend on member states’ willingness to give up a degree of sovereignty. The International Monetary Fund can virtually dictate fiscal policies, even including how much tax a government should levy on its citizens. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade regulates how much duty a nation can charge on imports. These organizations can be seen as the protoministries of trade, finance and development for a united world.”

The people who push for this agenda are generally members of a number of globalist organizations, from the Council on Foreign Relations to the Tavistock Institute to the World Economic Forum to the IMF or World Bank, not to mention the Bank for International Settlements and the Council For Inclusive Capitalism. However, these think-tank groups are only part of the bigger picture. They are supported by some of the largest banking and investment corporations in the world, including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, HSBC, Vanguard, Blackrock, etc.

If you want to know why mass illegal immigration is a growing crisis at this time and why the current government has been actively trying to enforce an open border police in the US,simply look into the financial aspects of pro-illegal immigration lobbying groups and think tanks pushing open borders messaging into the mainstream.You will find many of these banks and investment funds connected to them in one way or another.

For example,the list of companiesbacking the Governor of New York’s plan to subsidize illegal aliens entering the state is very revealing.If they’re allowed to continue offering incentives to illegals then those people will continue trying to come to the US; this isn’t complicated. The conspiracy is out in the open.

For the first few years of Joe Biden’s presidency, he and his cohorts attempted to deny there was any mass illegal migration problem at all. However, when media coverage (mostly independent) began to expose the enormous caravans of illegals overwhelming border towns like El Paso, Texas, he was forced to acknowledge that the crisis was in fact a crisis.

But, if you thought that forcing Biden to admit to the migrant disaster was going to force him to do something about it, you were sorely mistaken. The reason mass immigration exists right now is exactly because the Biden Administration and globalist institutions are offering free handouts to “asylum seekers.” All they have to do to stop the rising tide of illegals is to stop offering them free stuff. Clearly, the political elites have no intention of doing this.

Instead, government officials, think-tanks and the media have decided that since they’re now pressed to admit that mass immigration and open borders are real, they’re going to spin the crisis as if it’s actually a good thing for America.

In a narrative similar to the one used by EU officials to justify their support of the invasion of Islamic fundamentalists from 2014 onward, American elites claim that western nations are “desperate for a younger population” which can fill the “needs of the labor market.” They claim than mass migrations into the west are “good for the economy.”

This was also the primary message of a World Economic Forumconference on migration and laborheld in March.The globalist organization discussed how open borders and mass immigration could be framed as a “positive” in terms of economic advantages.And the talking points derived from WEF events always find their way into the corporate media. The main takeaway? Protectionism (of national borders) is bad and countries that engage in it will be at an economic disadvantage.

Since last month there’s been a hailstorm of establishment media articles and news reports suggesting that mass immigration will boost GDP and make America stronger. These assertions are all built ona single linefrom a single report from the Congressional Budget Office which states:

“In our projections, the deficit is also smaller than it was last year because economic output is greater, partly as a result of more people working. The labor force in 2033(EDITOR’S NOTE: Do they mean 2023?)is larger by 5.2 million people, mostly because of higher net immigration. As a result of those changes in the labor force, we estimate that, from 2023 to 2034, GDP will be greater by about $7 trillion and revenues will be greater by about $1 trillion than they would have been otherwise. We are continuing to assess the implications of immigration for revenues and spending.”

Bloomberg recentlypublished an articleboasting that this line from the CBO report shows that the rising fears among Americans over illegal immigration are unfounded. They question why the migrant crisis is a top issue going into the 2024 elections and cite a number of major banking institutions that have adjusted their US fiscal outlook into the positive because of the CBO’s data point and higher immigration. Bloomberg quotes the HSBC:

“Immigration is not just a highly charged social and political issue, it is also a big macroeconomic one,” Janet Henry, global chief economist at HSBC Holdings Plc, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. No advanced economy is benefiting from immigration quite like the U.S., and “the impact of migration has been an important part of the U.S. growth story over the past two years.”

Firstly, let’s clarify something in terms of the CBO’s theory – The US deficit has fallen in direct correlation to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. It’s more expensive to borrow for everyone, including the government, which makes it more expensive to spend. Because of far higher interest payments the US is now addingover $1 Trillion every 100 daysto the national debt. That’s unprecedented.

Any spending cuts can be directly attributed to higher interest rates, NOT immigration. The CBO mentions this fact very quickly in the same report, without elaborating on why they think immigrants add value. But let’s consider the GDP claim for a moment; why would the CBO expect higher immigration to add $7 trillion to the GDP in the next ten years?

They say it’s about more people working, but what about more people taking welfare and other subsidies? Neither the CBO (nor the media) make any distinction between legal migrants and illegal migrants when it comes to economic effects.

Legal migrants usually have careers, business plans, skill sets and their own money coming into the US. Most illegals have nothing – Little education, no substantial skill sets, no money and no plan other than to get free handouts wherever possible. We have seen the proof of this in places like New York and Washington DC, where a tiny percentage of migrants bused into the cities have absolutely crushed their welfare infrastructure.

It’s estimated that the net lifetime cost of each illegal immigrant for the American taxpayeris over $68,000. While some illegals do end up paying taxes, their overall cost is far higher than the amount they pay in.

The jobs market has been inflated by trillions in Federal Reserve stimulus and most of the jobs created are low wage retail and service positions that will disappear in a couple years anyway. The CBO notes in the same report that unemployment is set to increase in 2024, but the media overlooked that little tidbit of information.

Migrants are not needed to keep the labor market going.In fact, as jobs numbers inevitably plummet due to higher interest rates illegals will only add to jobless levels and poverty levels in the US, further dragging the economy down.

Not to mention, the American housing market has suffered an oppressive spike in prices, with home costs and rents in many places doubling. This is caused in part by the millions of migrants entering the country each year looking for housing and getting help from US government programs to secure that housing. Get rid of the illegals and I guarantee rent costs will go down quickly.

Almost all of the projected GDP gain from illegal immigrants comes from their wages which go into their pockets (the same wages they send back to their families in their home countries). There is no direct GDP gain from illegals in terms of benefits to the overall economy.That said, the CBO may also be accounting for another factor which many Americans are unaware of – Government spending being added to GDP.

As I’ve noted in the past, a large portion of GDP calculated by state governments and the federal government comes from spending. The more the government spends the higher GDP climbs. It doesn’t matter if that money was wasted, it is still counted as rising economic activity.

So, if the US is adding 2-3 million illegals per year to the population and the government is spending thousands in tax dollars per year on each illegal through various subsidies, that will amount to billions per year in extra GDP. And the more they allow illegals to enter the country unchecked the more GDP can grow exponentially. Is that good for the economy? No. It’s going to destroy the economy and we are already seeing the effects, but the government and the media can spin it to look like it’s a positive.

The head of the CBO is a Republican but he’s also a former member of the IMF, so it’s not surprising he would paint mass immigration as a positive.The globalists want to end national sovereignty and the fastest way to do that is to create open border conditions, kill domestic economies, erase western culture and then swoop in with a “global solution” after the dust settles.This is the plan; to destabilize the US economic system, not save it. And, illegal immigrants are a useful tool for that end game.

The paralyzed millennial was recently seen using what he described as ""The Force"" to move a computer cursor around the screen to play Civilization VI with his mind. This is further evidence that the 'trans-humanism' movement - the merger of humans and machines - is accelerating development, fundamentally improving human lives, or at least that's what the billionaires are pitching.

EditorTim Hinchliffeof the tech blogThe Sociableposted a creepy quote from a new report commissioned by the UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory and conducted by RAND Europe and Frazer Nash Consulting that read:

""An 'internet of bodies' may also ultimately lead to an 'internet of brains', i.e. human brains connected to the internet to facilitate direct brain-to-brain communication and enable access to online data networks.""

RAND describes a future of the Internet of Bodies ecosystem that may morph into the Internet of Brains, i.e., a network of brain-to-brain connectivity. This technology could find itself in the marketplace between 2035 and 2050.

""Trans-humanism implies the adoption of considerably advanced technologies by 2050, including brain-to-brain communication and genetic enhancement, and thus depends on resolving the various scientific and engineering barriers currently characterizing the field,"" the report said.

According to the report, the technological applications for this new brain network include:

Wearable devices and implantsfor tracking and analyzing physiological and environmental data (e.g. biochips and implantable sensors). These technologies aim to achieve real-time continuous monitoring of physiological data to understand human health conditions and performance.

Sensory augmentation technologiessuch as hearing and retinal implants designed to improve or augment sensory activities, particularly vision and hearing. Smart prosthetics are a related category, including exoskeletons, i.e. whole-body robotic suits that enhance end users' physical capabilities and improve their mobility, strength, endurance and other abilities.

Brain-computer or brain-brain interfacesthat establish direct communications between human brains and/or computer devices.

The latest example of transhumanism is Neuralink's brain chip...

2024-03-31 09:00:00,From Enlightenment To Ignorance: Society's Dangerous Embrace Of Stupidity,https://web.archive.org/web/20240331133044/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/enlightenment-ignorance-societys-dangerous-embrace-stupidity#comment-stream,"Authored by Anthony Esolen via American Greatness,

What would be the state of a society in which a will to stupidity were united with a will to power?

When I first decided to study and teach literature as my life’s vocation, I foresaw the work ahead of me—to learn as much as I could about English letters. Was I still unread in the Victorian novel? That would have to change. Had I a blank area in early American? It would have to be filled. The idea, though, was not simply to cover this and check off that. It was to gain a broad view of the whole, to see the relations of one area to another, to hear Melville in conversation with Milton, to set Jay Gatsby off against Tom Jones, to hear the American strains of confidence and rule-breaking in Walt Whitman, and the no less American strains of reserve and fence-setting in Robert Frost.

But to study English literature is to open yourself to the literature of other nations, because English authors were never reading only English. You cannot have Chaucer without the three great Florentines: Dante, Petrarch, and, especially, Boccaccio. You cannot have the English romantics without the German romantics. If you want to best appreciate what is characteristic of Tudor and Stuart drama, with its boisterous violation of the “unities” of space and time as it whisks you from Rome to Alexandria and back, or lets pass sixteen years as Time himself comes on stage to tell you of it, you should become acquainted with the near contemporary drama of Racine and Corneille just across the water, with its classical concentration of action within a single day.

This, of course, is the work of a lifetime. I continue to learn languages and read literature I have never encountered before. But to call most of it “work” is to mistake its nature. It would be as if a self-described lover of art should drag himself from bed and mutter to his valet, “Dear me, I suppose Imustgo to the Sistine today. Paintings and paintings, nothing but paintings. Michelangelo, you know. Creation of man all the way to the what’s-it, with devils and bankers going one way and angels and decent sorts going the other. Molesworth, whereisyour mind wandering? Kindly hold the mirror so I can see myself.”

Yet that, as I see now, is the aim of our schools: to produce spoiled, self-satisfied graduates with the stolidity but not the innocence (and usually not the income) of an upper-class twit—a Bertie Wooster, if Bertie were sullen, debauched, and always in a state of political water-boiling. That is not the same asignorance.I do not read Sanskrit, so I am largely ignorant of Sanskrit poetry. Had I more years ahead of me than I do, I might learn Sanskrit. I know something of the language, and I am piqued by the theology of Shankara, the greatest of commentators on the Rig-Vega. But I don’t have the years. Meanwhile, I have a Russian Bible that will provide my next re-introduction to the word of God, because when you know a language as poorly as I know Russian, you have to take things very slowly, and when you do that, you often see things that ease and fluency often miss, and these things can be small objects of wonder. It is like having to cross the woods afoot rather than driving along a road that cuts it in half. You might hear the ovenbird that way.

No, ignorance is one thing; we’re all going to be ignorant of most of the things there are to know. It used to be that a titan in mathematics, a Leonhard Euler, could be expert in all the areas of that subject; those days are gone. The topologist may be ignorant of Milton; that depends on his reading. But he is certainly going to be ignorant of most of the other branches of mathematics, simply because he has not got the time for them.Ignorance is one thing.Stupidityis another.

Bystupidity,I do not mean mere dullness or sluggishness in the organ of understanding. I mean what the etymology suggests. You arestupidwhen you gape. The emperor Frederick II was called “Stupor Mundi,” “The Wonder of the World,” and to bestupefiedstill, in English, might suggest that you are overcome with astonishment. Butstupidityhas come to denote a gaping that is as far removed from wonder as possible.You arestupidwhen you gape indifferently at something excellent that you have the power to understand but without understanding it and without caring to,when you are unmoved by a beauty that you have the power to apprehend but you make sure you will not apprehend, when you shut the eyes of your soul against the goodness they might otherwise see.

Suppose you are trying to introduce a savage to a system of writing. He isignorantof what the scratches and squiggles are supposed to say. Once you show him that they do speak, he should be interested, and if he has a lively mind, he will be like Sequoyah, who brought writing to the Cherokees.But if he has decided beforehand that nothing you have to show him is worth his time, he will be resolutelystupid:gaping on the thing and thinking that it is mere chicanery or foolishness or whatnot.

That sort of stupidity is what our schools are about.They do not teach young people about the glory of Melville, if they teach Melville at all, but about how Melville does or does not fit into some gridwork of identity politics, so that the work of art and intelligence itself,Moby-Dick, is left on the shore like a beached whale, dead and stinking, while onlookers in their stupidity hold their noses and pass by.

Nor is Melville an exceptional case. Consider what Milton thought the most beautiful thing in all of creation: the human form, male or female, as expressed most powerfully in the human face. Now consider how far we have gone to deny that such beauty, male or female in its characteristic manifestations, even exists. Suppose I say that ballet dancing or certain kinds of gymnastics most beautifully conform to the willowy beauty of the female body, while such things as weightlifting and football do not. I do not know which will cause me to be reviled more: my sense that the latter is awkward or my sense that the former is graceful and lovely. In this matter, I am requiredto be stupid andto gape in indifferenceat the one and the other.

It is the same with marriage and family life. Suppose I see a large family at a reunion. There are three or four generations, about fifty or sixty people in all. That’s by no means a lot, or at least it wasn’t when I was a boy, not when I had twenty-eight aunts and uncles and thirty-nine first cousins, and neighbor children had the like. I should be struck by the sheer human vitality. But if my first thought is that there are too many, that the women must have been pregnant too often, and that birth control would have solved the problem,I amstupid.I am like a savage who would rather dig under bark for grubs than learn how to plant seeds.

Now suppose that thiswill to stupidityis both the engine and the object of political power. When Sequoyah completed his syllabary of the Cherokee language, it took his people only a couple of years to see what a great gift he had given them. But if I were to say that Americans should learn to honor the religion without which their nation would never have been born and to be grateful for the gifts it conferred, even if they do not themselves believe in its teachings, I might as well hang a sign around my neck, inviting everyone,especially teachers, politicians, professional entertainers, and journalists,to spit on me and to make my name a byword from coast to coast. You must bestupidto be safe.

Readers may think of similar cases. Stupidity, apparently, is no obstacle to success in Google’s AI department; it is the royal road.Stupidity sells; stupidity is all the rage.Only someonestupidbefore the beauty of man and woman could suppose that a lopping-off here and a pin-the-tail there could turn one into the other, but dare to call out the stupidity, even in private, and you risk your career.I am not to honor my country; I am to bestupidbefore the contributions it has made to the world. I am not to be enthralled by the wonder of the cell and its intricate design:stupiditymust reduce it to random jelly, asstupidityreduces the miraculous human being in the womb, with all its latent powers unfolding, to a wart, a tumor, or a parasite.

Hear, O America, the powers that be, the powers that be are united, and you must bestupidwith all your heart and soul and mind and strength, or else.

2024-03-31 09:20:00,"""Capitalism Has Failed""",https://web.archive.org/web/20240331133044/https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/capitalism-has-failed#comment-stream,"Authored by Jeff Thomas via International Man,

Today, more than at any time previously, Westerners are justifying a move toward collectivist thinking with the phrase, “Capitalism has failed.”

In response to this, conservative thinkers offer a knee-jerk reaction that collectivism has also had a dismal record of performance. Neither group tends to gain any ground with the other group, but over time, the West is moving inexorably in the collectivist direction.

As I see it, liberals are putting forward what appears on the surface to be a legitimate criticism, and conservatives are countering it with the apology that,yes, capitalism is failing, but collectivism is worse.

Unfortunately, what we’re seeing here is not classical logic, as Aristotle would have endorsed, but emotionalism that ignores the principles of logic.

If we’re to follow the rules of logical discussion, we begin with the statement that capitalism has failed and, instead of treating it as a given, we examine whether the statement is correct.Onlyifit proves correct can we build further suppositions upon it.

Whenever I’m confronted with this now oft-stated comment, my first question to the person offering it is, “Have you ever lived in a capitalist country?” That is, “Have you ever lived in a country in which, during your lifetime, a free-market system dominated?”

Most people seem initially confused by this question, as they’re residents of either a European country or a North American country and operate under the assumption that the system in which they live is a capitalist one.

So, let’s examine that assumption.

A capitalist, or “free market,” system is one in which the prices of goods and services are determined by consumers and the open market, in which the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government, price-setting monopoly, or other authority.

Today, none of the major (larger) countries in what was once referred to as the “free world” bear any resemblance to this definition. Each of these countries is rife with laws, regulations, and a plethora of regulatory bodies whose very purpose is to restrict the freedom of voluntary commerce. Every year, more laws are passed to restrict free enterprise even more.

Equally as bad is the fact that, in these same countries, large corporations have become so powerful that, by contributing equally to the campaigns of each major political party, they’re able to demand rewards following the elections, that not only guarantee them funds from the public coffers, but protect them against any possible prosecution as a result of this form of bribery.

There’s a word for this form of governance, and it’s fascism.

Many people today, if asked to describe fascism, would refer to Mussolini, black boots, and tyranny. They would state with confidence that they, themselves, do not live under fascism. But, in fact, fascism is, by definition, a state in which joint rule by business and state exists. (Mussolini himself stated that fascism would better be called corporatism, for this reason.)

In recognizing the traditional definition of fascism, there can be no doubt that fascism is the driving force behind the economies of North America and Europe.

In addition,the concept of any government taking by force from some individuals the fruits of their labour and bestowing it upon others is by no means free-market. It is a socialist concept. And, in any country where roughly half of the population are the recipients of such largesse, that country has, unquestionably, settled deeply into a socialist condition.

However, this is by no means a new idea. As Socrates asked Adeimantus:

Do not their leaders deprive the rich of their estates and distribute them among the people; at the same time taking care to preserve the larger part for themselves?

So, which is it?Are we saying here that these countries are socialist or fascist?

Well, in truth, socialism, fascism, and, indeed, communism are all forms of collectivism. They all come under the same umbrella.

So, what we’re witnessing is liberals, rightfully criticising the evils of fascism, but failing to understand it for what it is—a form of collectivism. Conservatives, on the other hand, do their best to continue to operate under their countries’ socialist laws, regulations, and regulatory bodies, whist continuing to imagine that a remnant of capitalism remains.

And so we return to the question, “Have you ever lived in a country in which, during your lifetime, a free-market system dominated?”

Such countriesdo exist. It should be pointed out, however, that even they tend to move slowly toward collectivism over time. (After all, it’s in collectivism that they gain their power.) However, some countries are “newer,” just as the US was in the early nineteenth century and, like the US, the governments have not yet had enough time to sufficiently degrade the economies that have been entrusted to them.

In addition,some citizenries are feistier than others and/or are less easy to convince that, by allowing themselves to be dominated by their governments, they’ll actually be better off.

Whatever the reasons, there are most certainly countries that are far more free-market than the countries discussed above.

But, what does this tell us of the future? What can be done to turn these great powers back to a more free-market system? Well, the bad news is that that’s unlikely in the extreme. To be sure, we, from time to time, have inspired orators, such as Nigel Farage or Ron Paul, who remind us what we “should” do to put these countries back on track, so that they serve the people of the country, rather than its leaders. But, historically, such orators haveneversucceeded in reversing the trend one iota.

History tells us that political leaders, in their pursuit of collectivism, never reverse the trend. They insteadride it all the way to the bottom, then bail out, if they can.

However, it is ever true that, in some locations in the world, there have always been free-market societies. Over time, they deteriorate under the hands of their leaders and, as they do, others spring up.

The choice of the reader is to look upon the world as his oyster—to assess whether he is more or less content with the country he’s in and confident that it will continue to be a good place in which to live, work, invest, and prosper, or, if not, to consider diversifying, or even moving entirely, to a more rewarding, more capitalist jurisdiction.

In a series of short videos on TikTok, Moreno bragged about receiving 'stacks of cash' from American taxpayers and urged other illegal aliens to take advantage of all the free money progressives were handing out. He has thanked ""Papa Biden"" for the free cash.

""I didn't cross the Rio Grande to work like a slave,"" Moreno said in a TikTok video in Spanish, adding, ""I came to the US to mark my territory.""

""You're hurt because I make more than you without much work while you work like slaves, understand?"" he said in another video, noting, ""That's the difference between you and me. I'm always going to make lots of money without much work, and you're always going to be exploited and miserable and insignificant.""

Moreno even encouraged other illegal aliens toinvade American homes under squatting laws: ""I learned that there is a law that says if a house is not inhabited, then we can take it ... and here in the United States, terrain deformation also applies, and I think that will be my next business: invade abandoned houses.""

Thanks to President Biden'sdisastrous open southern borders, Moreno crossed into the country illegally in early 2022 through Eagle Pass, Texas. He skipped out on his initial check-in with ICE.

In a statement on Friday, The Epoch Times quoted ICE officials who said Moreno was caught in the suburban Columbus area of Gahanna.

""Leonel Moreno is an unlawfully present citizen of Venezuela, who illegally entered the country April 23, 2022.

""Moreno was placed into the ATD [Alternatives to Detention] program by Border Patrol and was told to report to Enforcement and Removal Operations office within 60 days of arriving at his destination.""

""Moreno did not report as required. On March 29, 2024, Moreno was arrested in Gahanna, Ohio, by officers with ERO Detroit's Columbus office and is currently detained pending further immigration proceedings.""

Most Americans are open to legal immigration and importing some of the best and brightest to further the progress of this nation. However, the Biden administration and alliedtaxpayer-funded NGOsare importing some of the dumbest criminals the world has to offer ahead of the elections.

2024-03-31 13:46:09,LGBTQ+++ Propaganda: The Tranny Visibility Day Easter Coup (TOTAL VICTORY),https://web.archive.org/web/20240401112021/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-03-31/lgbtqtm-propaganda-tranny-visibility-day-easter-coup-total-victory,"Originally published viaArmageddon Prose:

Nip/tucking the latest corporate LGBTQ propaganda fisted from on high upon the American public.

You might have mistakenly assumed today is the day the Lord’s Only Chosen Son Is Risen.

You would be incorrect in that assumption.

It might be Easter somewhere in Africa or Latin America where the LGBTQ++™ conquistadors have yet to gain a foothold, but, in the United States, Easter Sunday is now actually something called “Transgender Day of Visibility,” per presidential decree.

“My Administration is working to stop the bullying and harassment of transgender children and their families.  The Department of Justice has taken action to push back against extreme and un-American State laws targeting transgender youth and their families and the Department of Justice is partnering with law enforcement and community groups to combat hate and violence.  My Administration is also providing dedicated emergency mental health support through our nationwide suicide and crisis lifeline — any LGBTQI+ young person in need can call “988” and press “3” to speak with a counselor trained to support them.  We are making public services more accessible for transgender Americans, including with more inclusive passports and easier access to Social Security benefits.  There is much more to do.  I continue to call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act, to codify civil rights protections for all LGBTQI+ Americans.

Today, we send a message to all transgender Americans:  You are loved.  You are heard.  You are understood.  You belong.  You are America, and my entire Administration and I have your back.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States,do hereby proclaim March 31, 2024, as Transgender Day of Visibility.”

On this day of false assumptions — you know what they say about assuming — you might have assumed remote, largely conservative (if due to nothing else than geographic isolation) Alaska to be immune from the ravages of Social Justice™.

You would have, once more, assumed incorrectly.

“An Alaskan woman had her Planet Fitness membership revoked after she took a photo of a ‘man with a penis’ at one of the gym’s women’s locker roomsearlier this week.

The incident occurred at the Fairbanks location.

A woman recorded herself speaking about the ordeal when she saida person identifying as ‘queer LBG’ was shaving in the female locker room.

Planet Fitness confirmed to Fox News Digital that the woman violated policy regarding taking photos and/or videos in the locker room, resulting in the loss of her membership.

‘As the home of the Judgement Free Zone,Planet Fitness is committed to creating an inclusive environment,’Planet Fitness chief corporate affairs officer McCall Gosselin said in a statement to Fox News Digital.”

Imagine the shock of this domestic terrorist woman upon entering a ladies’ room, only to find a fully grown “queer LGB” shaving his whiskers in the mirror!

No word on whether his masculine loins were exposed to the open air or not (reporting does not specify). Some men prefer to air-dry.

In any case, it lends new meaning to the “penis-showing game.”

Frankly, Planet Fitness has always been a fake gym for retards, so it should have gone out of business years ago. But if it takes a tranny grooming himself and then the woman who complains about it getting her membership suspended for her efforts to drive it into the ditch, so be it.

“Never look a gift-horse in the mouth,” my Midwestern Irish-Catholic grandmammy used to say as she cashed her meager Social Security check each month. (She was always a Miller High Life kind of lady, by the way. The Life and Virginia Slims go together like peanut butter and jelly, she used to say.)

“Planet Fitness critics are saying ‘go woke, go broke,’ calling on the top fitness chain to receive the ‘Bud Light’ treatmentafter an uproar over its transgender locker room policy created a social media stir.

The chain saw a $400 million dive in valuationfrom $5.3 billion to $4.9 billion just days after revoking an Alaska woman's membership for snapping photos of a transgender woman, who was biologically male, shaving in the women's locker room.”

Alicensed clinical social workerwho “counsels troubled pre-teens” into getting on the gender spectrum train-ride to ruin has requested from the surgeons/butchers who perform “gender-affirming care” that they sculpt genitalia that “looks like flowers or abstract sculpture”:

https://twitter.com/genspect/status/1770637625143050571

“I simply can’t tell where one gender ends and another begins.

Medical interventions allow some of us to change our primary and secondary sex characteristics. We have phalloplasty that creates a penis and a scrotum and testicles. We have vaginoplasty that creates a vagina and a vulva…

But it’s clear that cisgender bodies are still the reference point*. But will technology give us options that are artistic and creative?...

Do we have to stick to penis & vagina norms? Can we have genitalia that looks like flowers or abstract sculpture? Can we have multiple? Can they be interchangeable?”

A bit more on this gentleman and his “work,” or what passes for it, viaReduxx:

“Jacobs, who counsels troubled pre-teens, has described himself as a ‘kinky, BDSM sexworker’ and says he works with ‘adolescents to the elderly.’He also wrote an essay for the 2020 book Sex, Sexuality, and Trans Identities in which he connects BDSM fetish practices to those who claim a transgender status.

In ‘Hormones and Handcuffs: The Intersection of Transgender Identities, BDSM, and Polyamory,’Jacobs notes that those who identify as transgender ‘seem almost predisposed’ to participate in sadomasochistic fetish subcultures. He explains this by placing blame on ‘sexual hostility’ towards trans-identified individuals, stating that in his view, ‘our bodies are often devalued.’…

Age play, Jacobs explains, ‘involves fetishization of an age differential through ‘mommy/child,’ ‘daddy/son,’ or ‘teacher/student’ personae.’ Suggested accessories for the sexual re-enactment of ‘traumatic experiences that occurred during one’s youth’ are cribs for infants, diapers, and crayons.

The self-described ‘kink therapist’ also describes forced feminization, a sadomasochistic fetish ‘for many trans women prior to coming out.’ Depictions of this activity ‘are easily found on the internet,’ Jacobs advises.”

There have been no banking crisis events, No Govt shutdown fears,no surprise war escalations. And yet Gold moves… But it is not alone.""

Xi doesn't just fire the bazooka. He is the bazooka...

Authored byGoldFixZH Edit

Our suspicion is,someone is about to announce policy change. Either Japan, China, or Europe. NOT THE US at least initially; With Japan and China being the most likely.

But Japan just changed policy and while that still can (and will) affect the market, it is a known-unknown. So that leaves China.

The best candidate for acceleration we all know can no doubt be the coming BRICS summit if this is China buying. Or even more so, some western announcement regarding Gold and currency re-valuation. But this is different.

Please keep in mind the following statement we’ve made on social-media semi-humorously several times before reading on:

""There are no more shorts in Gold, only longs waiting to buy.""

We think when a situation such as above exists, and you have made up your mind strategically to buy something, the only things remaining between you and action are reasons to wait (like data or news) or similarly, catalysts to buy. in short: Timing of action is next.

So… we can spot one catalyst for the acceleration coming out of China not discussed much (ZH excepted) yet. The back-burnered China stimulus “Bazooka”.

For the past months China has been watched closely by western banks for a bazooka of stimulus to get things going there. Banks have set the table for that talking about Copper as being in short supply as well. But they stopped talking “Bazooka” a few months ago.

And no bazooka has come. Until maybe now.  Goldman Sachs published a very dry policy brief report entitled:China: PBOC reportedly ordered to inject liquidity to the economy

Here’s that report’s bottom line (emphasis ours):

Offshore media reported today (March 28th) that President Xi ordered the PBOC to inject liquidity into the economy via buying central government bonds (CGB),... “the People’s Bank of China should gradually increase the trading of treasury bonds in its open market operations”.

Though the exact quote didn’t seem to point to a direct order for PBOC to buy CGB in the secondary market,some investors2interpreted this news as a green light for rapid PBOC balance sheet expansion.This would guide long-term CGB yields down further, as investors would price out the impact of supply shocks.

ZeroHedge also noted this and did a write up of the GS analysis titledDid China Just Quietly Start QE?

Questions have been swirling about what is behind the recent surge in gold (and general spike across all commodity prices). This may be the answer.Todaythe SCMPreported that it is ""just a matter of time before China’s central bank pulls out a controversial monetary policy tool that it has not used in more than two decades"" adding that President Xiordered the PBOC to inject liquidity into the economy via buying central government bonds (CGB),

The previously cited report went on to describe that this indirect QE served a double duty of soaking up the increased issuance by the Government as well as encouraging stability in the CGB markets which would lend support to stocks presumably. Long story short, they will buy their own bonds if this report is accurate simultaneously weakening the Yuan and lowering their Bond yields. That money has to go somewhere right?

If the US Fed is not easing in June, an increasing probability, then why are stocks, Gold, and even the dollar rallying? We believe someone is again sniffing out a type of Bazooka in China.

It could be China buying gold in anticipation of a monetary easing. It could be Western banks buying in anticipation of this happening. Not sure yet.

But someone has decided they cannot wait for a dip in gold right now; even with a strong dollar.

The signs of this are apparent:There has been no data suggesting the Fed would ease. There have been no unmanaged banking crisis events, No Govt shutdown fears, no surprise war escalations. And yet Gold moves… But it is not alone.

But it’s not just gold rallying. It's stocks as well

During this time Stocks and Gold have made repeated new All Time Highs with the dollar remaining strong and getting stronger.1

Bitcoin has also recovered nicely from a spate of futures-related selling to challenge once again its own ATH.

We noted Gold’s behavior started re-exhibiting that of a big buyer again roundabout on Feb 12th, but weren’t sure. Here are all the key markets watched from that day forward.

Gold buying. gets away from whoever was buying it, or they went to market…

Silver, alternately participating, then getting hammered as Gold keeps rising…

The Dollar: Having no appreciable negative effect on commodities while holding its own…

Copper: Got the message early with Gold, but backing off recently…

Stocks, Just chugging along, not a worry in the world…

Bitcoin, no real correlation and doing its own thing, but not contradicting things either…

Oil: Someone is buying it, and while US Driving season is a factor, and the Russian factor looms large, The world does not use as much RBOB as it used to…

Someone is no longer willing to wait to buy Gold, Stocks, or even Dollars.

This next sentence by Goldman describes the *effects* of a QE event.

""This would guide long-term CGB yields down further…similar to the experience of 2007.""

This is The PBOC buying its own Government’s long term Bonds in 2007…

Here’s What Happened Last Time China did indirect QE…

This time, China’s potential effect economically is a lot bigger, as is their appetite for Gold and commodities.

We know one thing for sure. When bond yields drop, as they did in 2009 by our own QE, investors look for alternatives to Bonds. And it always means the intended target is stocks. To the extent China’s government does not dissuade commodity investment, it also means Gold, Oil, and Silver. They do need to grow their capital/financial markets now.

2024-03-31 19:50:00,Minnesota Law School Drops Exclusion Of Whites And Males From Diversity Scholarship,https://web.archive.org/web/20240401112021/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/minnesota-law-school-drops-exclusion-whites-and-males-diversity-scholarship#comment-stream,"Authored by Jonathan Turley,

There is a curious resolution of a civil right complaint against University of Minnesota Law School over a diversity fellowship sponsored by the law firm of Jones Day. Despite being created by a law firm and administered by a law school, the fellowship violated federal law in excluding white and male applicants.The law school finally threw in the towel, but there remains an uncertainty over whether the school is engaging in a subterfuge by opening up the scholarship while retaining its original purpose.

The Jones Day Diversity Fellowship launched in December 2022 to extend full tuition for three years at the law school. The scholarship also allows the recipient to work as a summer associate at Jones Day, one of the most sought-after firms for summer employment.The firm website maintains that “We aggressively pursue hiring, retaining, and developing lawyers from historically underrepresented groups and backgrounds.”

Variousconservative siteshave slammed the diversity fellowship, which was the subject of acivil rights complaint by Adam Kissel.

The September 2023 complaint to the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is now closed following a settlement to drop any “preference based on race or sex.”

The question is what difference the settlement will make in actual awards.

Law schools have been accused of “gaming the system” on admissions criteria for years to circumvent federal law and governing cases on the use of race or gender. Those concerns only increased after the Supreme Court categorically rejected the use of race in admissions inStudents for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard CollegeandStudents for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. University of North Carolina.

Critics are still unclear on how Jones Day and Minnesota Law School will achieve its diversity goals without applying such a preference, even if the applications are not limiting on the basis of race.

The university maintains that it will not impose threshold exclusions of whites and males but will select applicants “based on their commitment to enhancing diversity and inclusion” and “whose life experiences bring unique, extraordinary, or other fresh perspective to campus, including first generation college graduate and students from socioeconomically challenged backgrounds.'”

This is a recurring complaint for Minnesota.It came under fire last May when the Office of Undergraduate Students created a paid internship program applicationto only non-White applicants.

The question going forward is whether there is a viable basis to challenge the program on an “as applied” theory. If whites males continue to be excluded, the challengers could return to allege that nothing changed beyond the language.

And while stocks just refuse to back down, we turn to the latest must read Weekly Rundown Report from Goldman, in which we read that ""single stock short flow has increased for 7 consecutive weeks"" and""saw the largest net selling since early January, driven entirely by short sales as long flows were fairly muted.""with ""7 of 11 US sectors were net sold on the week""even as Macro Products – index and ETF combined – were net bought for a 2nd straight week (4 of the last 5), driven by long buys outpacing short sales ~3 to 1. And so yet another bear trap sprung - as hedge fund short single names for 13 of the past 14 days - expect the meltup to continue until all bears have been steamrolled ahead of the November elections.

2024-03-31 21:00:00,"PBS Segment Claims Trump Wants To ""Purge"" Gay People From America",https://web.archive.org/web/20240401112021/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/pbs-segment-claims-trump-wants-purge-gay-people-america#comment-stream,"Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news,

In a ludicrousparanoid segment onPBS NewsHourthis week, the network’s White House correspondent Laura Barron-Lopez claimed that Donald Trump is not only planning to roll back “civil rights,” but also to “purge” LGBT people from the country.

Barron-Lopez and anchor William Brangham made the assertions while discussing Trump’s real criticism of transgender surgery and hormone therapy being carried out on children, and biological men competing in women’s sports.

“On the campaign trail, Trump has been talking about what he plans to do if elected in November, and thatincludes rolling back the rights of millions of LGBTQ people.It’s part of a wider playbook to undo many modern civil rights advances for minority groups,” Brangham asserted.

He then introduced Barron-Lopez, whoclaimed Trump “plans quick action if elected,” against LGBT people.

She then suggested that Trump and “roughly 100 right-wing organisations led by the Heritage Foundation,” have a secret plan to wipe out LGBTQ people… or something.

What does the dastardly plan consist of? Eliminating DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) from government mandates and banning federal funding for teaching Critical Race Theory.

OK, those things are not civil rights. If anything they are in direct opposition to civil rights because they discriminate based on skin colour.

Barron-Lopez, who is also a CNN political analyst, then complained that Trump will “rescind health-care protections for transgender people and urge Congress to define gender as male and female, fixed at birth.”

Without any actual explanation or evidence she further asserted that“this plan also is trying to stop any and all acknowledgement of an acceptance of gender identity and LGBTQ people, period.”

The correspondent then quoted Professor Thomas Zimmer at Georgetown, “who studies authoritarian regimes,” noting “Trump wasn’t necessarily able to institute this in 2017, when he first took office, because he didn’t have the amount of loyalists that he plans on having across the board. And with these new loyalists, Zimmer said, he can advance a white Christian evangelical ideal of American society.”

VT of Zimmer was then played where he stated “It is opposed to egalitarian democracy because it fundamentally does not agree that all people are equal or deserve to be treated as equal citizens. Only those who belong to the “true people,” to real America, deserve that. And so everyone else needs to either be purged from the nation or, at the very least, accept their sort of lesser place in society.”

Barron-Lopez then stated “Professor Zimmer added that that type of purging he’s talking about takes roots in the McCarthyism of the early 1950s, where they essentially tried to sweep away anyone across American society that would deviate from perceived norms.”

On the campaign trail, Donald Trump has been talking about what he plans to do if elected in November. That includes rolling back LGBTQ rights.The proposal is part of a wider playbook to undo many modern civil rights advances for minority groups.@lbarronlopezreports.pic.twitter.com/VvzgddCZn2

So they’re saying essentially because he believes there are two sexes, that means Trump wants to root out and “eliminate”sweep away” all LGBTQ people.

What a juicy slice of leftist kookery that was.

What are “LGBTQ rights” and how are they different from the rights we all have?

Modern ""teachings"" of race and racism teach bias toward certain races, which is a particular ideology, which again, doesn't belong as part of a primary or secondary public school curriculum. This is not hard.

More fear mongering.That's all the left does.

Not defining gender as male and female has muddied medical research and messaging. If people want to take on a different identity in their own time, no one is stopping them.

What rights would be rolled back?

2024-03-31 21:32:57,"""Turkish People Demanded Change"": Erdogan Suffers Shocking Defeat In Country's Municipal Elections",https://web.archive.org/web/20240401112021/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/turkish-people-demanded-change-erdogan-suffers-shocking-defeat-countrys-municipal-elections#comment-stream,"In a historic upset, Turks dealt President Tayyip Erdogan and his party their biggest electoral blow yet in Saturday's nationwide local vote that reasserted the opposition as a political force and reinforced Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu as the president's chief rival amid raging inflation and the highest borrowing costs since the president swept to power more than two decades ago.

With most of the votes counted, Imamoglu declared victory in the Istanbul mayoral race after leading by 10 percentage points while his Republican People's Party (CHP) retained Ankara and gained 15 other mayoral seats in cities nationwide.

According to Reuters,it marked the worst defeat for Erdogan and his AK Party (AKP) in their more than two decades in power, and could signal a change in the country's divided political landscape.Erdogan called the March 31 election outcome a ""turning point"" in a post-midnight address, and in a rare moment of public humility said the election results were not in line with his expectations, and vowed pledged self-criticism over the election results as he added that he still has 4 more years to fix his mistakes, while predicting that the positive results of the economic plan would become apparent in the second half of the year.

Erdogan and the AKP fared worse than opinion polls predicted due to soaring inflation, dissatisfied Islamist voters and, in Istanbul, Imamoglu's appeal beyond the CHP's secular base, analysts said.

""Those who do not understand the nation's message will eventually lose,"" Imamoglu, 53, told thousands of jubilant supporters late on Sunday, some of them chanting for Erdogan to resign.

""Tonight, 16 million Istanbul citizens sent a message to both our rivals and the president,""said the former businessman, who entered politics in 2008 and is now widely touted as a likely presidential challenger.

Erdogan, who in the 1990s was also mayor of his hometown Istanbul, had campaigned hard ahead of the municipal elections, which analysts described as a gauge of both his support and the opposition's durability.

Addressing crowds gathered at AKP headquarters in Ankara, the capital, Erdogan said his alliance had ""lost altitude"" across the nation and will take steps to address the message from voters.

""If we made a mistake, we will fix it"" in the years ahead, he said. ""If we have anything missing, we will complete it.""

Elsewhere in Ankara, thousands more supporters had earlier waved Turkish and party flags for a speech by reelected CHP Mayor Mansur Yavas, who trounced his AKP challenger in another disappointment for Erdogan.

According to 92.92% of ballot boxes opened in Istanbul, Europe's largest city and the country's economic engine, Imamoglu had 50.92% support compared with 40.05% for AKP challenger Murat Kurum, a former minister in Erdogan's national government. Polls had predicted a tight contest in Istanbul and possible CHP losses across the country.

Yet partial official results reported by state-run Anadolu Agency showed AKP and its main ally giving up mayoralties in 19 key municipalities including big cities Bursa and Balikesir in the industrialised northwest, possibly reflecting strains on wage earners.

In an even more shocking result, and a first in 35 years, the CHP led nationwide by almost 1% of the votes the results showed.

AKP was set to win mayor’s seat in 23 cities, down from 39 in 2019. CHP is leading the race in 36 provinces, compared with 21 in the last election, TRT reported.

At stake in Istanbul is control of a city of almost 16 million people with a $6.6 billion annual budget. Social aid payments from municipal budgets are critical to voters hit by Turkey’s cost-of-living crisis. How those funds are allocated are decided at municipal councils, making dominance there is just as important as winning the mayor’s seat.

Mert Arslanalp, assistant professor of political science at Istanbul's Bogazici University, said it wasErdogan's ""severest election defeat"" since coming to national power in 2002.

""Imamoglu demonstrated he could reach across the deep socio-political divisions that define Turkey's opposition electorate even without their institutional support,"" he said. ""This makes him the most politically competitive rival to Erdogan's regime.""

In 2019, Imamoglu had dealt Erdogan a sharp electoral blow when he first won Istanbul, ending 25 years of rule in the city by AKP and its Islamist predecessors, including Erdogan's own run as its mayor in the 1990s. CHP also won Ankara that year.The president struck back in 2023 by securing reelection and a parliamentary majority with his nationalist allies, despite a years-long cost-of-living crisis.

Analysts said the economic strains, including nearly 70% inflation and a slowdown in growth brought on by an aggressive monetary-tightening regime, moved voters to punish AKP this time.

""The economy was the decisive factor,"" said Hakan Akbas, a senior adviser at the Albright Stonebridge Group. ""Turkish people  demanded change and Imamoglu is now the default nemesis to President Erdogan.""

Erdogan said ending the second election cycle in less than a year will itself bring a reprive for the economy.

In front of the Istanbul Municipality building, flag-waving supporters said they wanted to see Imamoglu challenge Erdogan for the presidency in the future.

""We are very happy. I love him so much. We would like to see him as president,"" said Esra, a housewife.

Then again, Erdogan is not known for willingly parting with power and there is a case to be made that Imamoglu's days as Erdogan's challenger may be numbered: even after his second Istanbul victory in a row, Imamoglu has another battle to fight. He is accused of insulting members of the Supreme Election Council, which could result in his being banned from political office.

Rising popular support for the Islamist New Welfare Party, which took an even more hardline stance than Erdogan against Israel over the Gaza conflict, also sapped AKP support. The party took Sanliurfa from an AKP incumbant in the southeast.Imamoglu was reelected despite the collapse of the opposition alliance that failed to topple Erdogan last year.

The main pro-Kurdish party, which backed Imamoglu in 2019, fielded its own candidate under the DEM banner in Istanbul this time. But many Kurds put aside party loyalty and voted for him again, the results suggest.

In the mainly Kurdish southeast, DEM reaffirmed its strength, winning 10 provinces. Following previous elections, the state has replaced pro-Kurdish mayors with state-appointed ""trustees"" following previous elections over alleged militant ties.

Violence erupted earlier in the day, including one incident in the southeast in clashes by groups armed with guns, sticks and stones, killing one and wounding 11. In another, one neighbourhood official, or ""muhtar"", candidate was killed and four people were wounded in a fight, Anadolu reported.

Several others were hurt in other incidents while one person was shot dead and two were wounded overnight ahead of the vote in Bursa, the Demiroren news agency reported.

It was too early to observe a market reaction, but according to former Goldman and IIF strategist Robin Brooks, the market won't like the election result in Turkey, as it was ""hoping for an end to election-related stimulus and a return to orthodoxy. This result sends the opposite signal.Markets will see this as keeping Turkey in perpetual election mode. More pump-priming. More devaluation...""

""The opportunities are over,"" said Mayor Mike Johnson's political director Andres Carrera, who also serves as the city's Newcomer Communications Liaison, in an exchange with newly arrived migrants.

""New York gives you more. Chicago gives you more.So I suggest you go there where there is longer-term shelter. There are also more job opportunities there,"" Carrera continues in the video obtained by9News.

A top official in Denver was just caught on tape begging illegals to leave the city:Denver Newcomer Liaison: ""Any city. We can take you to the Canadian border, wherever.""He promises them that there are better stuff awaiting them in Chicago and NY.Denver is a self-designated…pic.twitter.com/NjsnmlTEHe

""We have received too many migrants and that is why we ran out of resources,"" Carrara tells a crowed inside Denver's primary migrant shelter.

""We are not going to block you if you want to say here,"" he continues. ""If you stay here you are going to suffer even more and I don’t want to see this.""

To facilitate their departure, Denver is offering topay for migrants' onward bus fareto a destination of their choice, whichother 'sanctuary cities' have decried,9Newsreports.

The migrants Carrera is seen speaking to on video arrived in Denver on March 26 on a bus organized by Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, according to a city spokesperson.

Abbott has bragged about flooding Denver and other so-called “sanctuary cities” with migrants who have crossed the U.S. border with Mexico.

Denver has implementedstrict limitson how long newly arrived migrants are allowed in city shelters;two weeks for individuals and six weeks for families with children.

""You don’t have to walk anywhere, we can buy you a free ticket,"" Carrera tells the group, which shows children milling around him as he speaks with their parents. ""You can go to any city. We can take you up to the Canadian border, wherever!""

A city spokesperson later said that Denver won't buy bus tickets to Canadian cities, but willhelp Migrants get to US cities near the Canadian border if they ask.

Wrapping up his remarks, Carrera asks the crowd ""Okay, who wants to travel to different cities where there is more work?""

""Who wants to stay in Denver?"" he then asked.

""Todos,"" a migrant replies - everyone.

2024-03-31 22:10:00,PBOC's Yuan Flip-Flop Sows Confusion Among Traders,https://web.archive.org/web/20240401112021/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/pbocs-yuan-flip-flop-sows-confusion-among-traders#comment-stream,"By John Liu and Zheng Wu, Bloomberg Markets Live reporters and analysts

1. The use of a familiar tool to stabilize the yuan sowed confusion and touched off a debate among investors.The People’s Bank of China stepped in to halt a drop in the currency last week by strengthening the fixing, and traders said state-owned banks then proceeded to dumped dollars onshore.

The move helped to stabilize the foreign-exchange market but it also left traders wondering about the People’s Bank of China’s intentions.Investors were baffled because the yuan’s earlier selloff had been triggered by a weaker-than-expected reference rate.

Authorities have allayed fears of a steep decline in the currency for now. The yuan is trading near the weak end of the band allowed by the reference rate, and state banks are selling an undisclosed amount of dollars to prop up the Chinese currency.

But the PBOC’s mixed signals have unsettled the market and the yuan may become even more volatile if policymakers relax their grip on it again.

2. Xi Jinping’s remarks on monetary tools generated a buzz but they’re unlikely to signal a move toward quantitative easing.The Chinese leader was quoted in a newly published book as saying the central bank should increase the buying and selling of government bonds,fueling speculation that Beijing was planning to embark on aggressive monetary easing.

A closer examination of the context in which the comments were made suggests otherwise. Xi was probably expressing a view on how the PBOC can fine-tune its market operations, not ramp up purchases of government bonds to flood the economy with liquidity, according to Bloomberg Economics.

There is still room for the PBOC to ease policy by lowering interest rates or the required reserve ratio. On the whole, the central bank is likely to exhaust all conventional tools before resorting to QE, and any move to trade government bonds will probably be part of efforts to better manage the sovereign yield curve.

3. Xiaomi’s stock surged 12% in the US on Thursday after the Chinese smartphone and appliance maker launched its first electric vehicle. With aggressive pricing, pre-orders for the SU7 models topped 50,000 within 27 minutes of their debut.

Xiaomi’s ambitious EV bet arrives at a challenging time. Carmakers from Tesla Inc. to BYD Co. are engaging in a price war as sales growth slows, with the former recently cutting production at its plant in China.  To make matters worse, trade tensions are compounding the pressure on the highly competitive sector. China’s EV exports to the European Union slumped in the first two month of the year amid a probe by Brussels into unfair subsidies.

""It is the ruling of the court is that all the rioting participation cases will be released on their own recognizance,"" Acosta ordered, noting that they will only remain jailedif there's a federal immigration hold blocking their release.

The arrests were made by the Texas Department of Public Safety in connection with aMarch 21 stampede of asylum-seeking migrants— mostly men from Venezuela — who torn down razor wire along the Rio Grande and rushed the border fence at Border Safety Initiative Marker No. 36 in the Riverside area of El Paso's Lower Valley.

Some migrants face charges of assault of a public servant for knocking down National Guard troops before order was regained. The migrants had sought to surrender themselves to U.S. Border Patrol in bids for asylum.

It was unclear if Acosta's decision applied only to the ""riot participation"" charge, or the assault and criminal mischief charges related to the border incident.

It is unknown how many migrants were booked on the charge of ""riot participation,"" a Class B misdemeanor - though Acosta referred to ""hundreds of arrestees,"" who he says are entitled to individual detention hearings within 48 hours.

The DA's office requested a continuance to have the hearings at a later date, however Acosta rejected the request.

""So if the DA’s office is telling me that they are not ready to go, what we’re going to do is we’re going to release all these individuals on their own recognizance,"" Acosta said at the hearing.

Meanwhile on Sunday, two other migrants - including a Colombian man, had separate hearings on criminal mischief chargesfor allegedly cutting border fencing. After being jailed with a $2,000 bond each, Magistrate Judge Antonio Aunalso released themon personal recognizance bonds, however both men have immigration holds.

Last week,Texas sent 700 National Guard soldiers to El Paso, including 200 with the Texas Tactical Border Force, to reinforce the border.

As theEl Paso Timesnotes further, 'Operation Lone Star video shows troops boarding a transport plane and on the border with riot shields moving migrants back so crews could replace rolls of damaged razor wire along the banks of the Rio Grande.'

2024-03-31 23:20:00,Did The COVID Psyop Fail?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240401112021/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/did-covid-psyop-fail#comment-stream,"Authored by Todd Hayen via Off-Guardian.org,

As you all know,I have not been one to believe that the tides are turning.But lots of people think they are. They cite many victories, in court, in the streets, with family and friends.

The fact that the agenda has not sent out a second wave of horror and fear propaganda is also rather telling to these folks.Where is the next pandemic? What happened to Covid’s diabolic never-ending run of mutations, what happened to Monkey Pox? What happened to Disease X?

Yes, all this could still happen, but it seems there have been more false starts—starts that didn’t go anywhere. But if so, you would think they wouldn’t have put them out there just to not have them continue. It’s been rather weird, like an electrical storm you see on the horizon with its threatening lightning strikes, but it never gets close enough to warrant closing the cellar door.

How about CBDCs? And the Digital IDs? You hear a lot about these, but nothing that is concretely happening to implement them. Is it happening in other places? Australia? Germany? The UK? Of course, a lot is said about it, on YouTube, and in alt media. Lots of talking heads, but how imminent is it? Actually, I won’t dwell on this, I have no doubt all of this is coming, but has the dragon been wounded? Even a little bit? Has this march into oblivion been slowed down?

Maybe there is no wounding of the general juggernaut of world rule by the schmucks who are claiming power.Although even that sacrosanct organization may have suffered from shell damage. Wasn’t DAVOS not all that they expected this past year? Hasn’t there been some pretty obvious whiplash from some leaders in their little club? How about the UN and the “sustainable development” circus? How is that going?

Anyway, I digress. Although the health of the world agenda, including all of these projects I mention, are all part of it, Covid, and pandemics in general, are the specific topics of this article.

I don’t buy any of this talk of victory for a New York minute.This is like cancer, you can’t claim victory until it is ALL gone, every last scrap of it.Remissions are nice, but if you’ve still got cancer in your body somewhere, it is only a time-out. I feel that this is similar. Even if one cell survived, it would start multiplying again and wouldn’t stop until it was big and gnarly and spitting out all the garbage this monster has been known to spit out. So, I don’t buy it…but…

Is it possible that at least one battle was won? Maybe,but just because they have pulled the troops back doesn’t mean they didn’t still take the city and got essentially what they stormed in for. I may still say that is a possibility. I mean, what did they want as a consequence of their Covid campaign? Did they want 100% compliance, with billions of sheep bowing down to them? Did they want everyone locked up in their own little cage, ala 1984, each of us in a squalid apartment with just a giant TV in the middle of it so Big Brother could blab at us all day long? If that is true, then indeed the psyop failed, because they didn’t get that—at least not yet.

But what if they got this: a toxic injection placed in billions of people worldwide that will kill untold millions over the course of about 20 years?Not only that, but the injection will render another untold millions sterile. Do the math here: how many people would need to be sterilized over 20 years to reduce the population worldwide by 1 billion? 2 billion? What other havoc could such a death jab wreak? What untold horrors are yet to overcome us? Your guess is as good as mine. Think zombies here, think soulless ghouls, think humans with no empathy, think lost humanity.

And that’s just the physical consequences.What about the psychological success they have had with the Covid campaign?Sure, many participants have shot them the bird regarding more boosters, and have ignored more threats of losing jobs over vaccine resistance. Sure, the courts have ruled in Canada that the illustrious leader here performed a no-no with his reckless enactment of the Emergency Act, and as a result, lawsuits are flowing into the courts. Does all this mean that no one fell for the psychological operation? That no one was mentally affected by the lockdowns, the masks, the closure of schools, churches, and other institutions? Does it mean that we have all recovered from the trauma of those three years, and mentally and emotionally we are just back to square one—all normal again?

If anyone reading this knows anything about hypnosis, they probably understand what hypnotic suggestion is all about.It is real, folks. What has been altered subliminally in our unconscious minds could be quite formidable.We are being programmed for better performance in future projects the agenda has in store for us. Most of the shrews reading this are safe from this brainwashing (hopefully) because we closed our eyes during the deadly meteor storm perpetrated by the fear-mongering agenda (watch The Day of the Triffids to understand that reference!)But those out there who got caught up in it and drank the delayed-reaction Kool-Aid—are all like sleeper spies from the Cold War, soon to be re-activated at some future date to continue complying with TPTB’s bidding.

Here I go again. I am supposed to be entertaining the possibility that the Covid psyop failed, not suggesting evidence to prove its great success. Sorry. Well, maybe it didn’t go as well as they wanted it to go. It does seem there was a lot more gas in the tank and that they could have pushed it a bit further than they did. They were doing pretty well, but they just fizzled out. Maybe they did expect more people to get vaxxed, maybe that was a disappointment.They sure looked like they were going for the whole enchilada with all their “you’ve GOT to get vaccinated!!” hoopla.Maybe they got too much pushback from us shrews. So many angry shrews showed up pretty quickly. And the shrews that were already on the scene, who were not surprised with all these shenanigans to begin with, just got louder and louder. Sure, not many sheep flipped, but some did. Their booster campaign is floundering (in my opinion, only because they turned the heat down, or off entirely).

So maybe they did get nicked a bit. Maybe a few arrows penetrated the armour, and they backed off a step or two. Maybe we did surprise the bastards with our resolve, tenacity, wit, and refusal to play the game.

But then again, maybe not.

2024-04-01 02:00:00,Why Is NATO And The Kiev Regime Terrified Of Russia's 'Zircon' Hypersonic Missile?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240401112021/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/why-nato-and-kiev-regime-terrified-russias-zircon-hypersonic-missile#comment-stream,"Authored by Drago Bosnic via infobrics.org,

Even beforethe horrendous Crocus City Hall terrorist attack, the Russian military'slong-range strike capabilitieswere sending shivers down the spines of NATO aggressors and their Neo-Nazi junta puppets.Weapons such as the 3M22 ""Zircon"", a scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missile, have been inducted into service in recent years and arenow also being transferred to land-based platforms, specifically the K300P ""Bastion-P"" coastal defense system. With a 1500 km range (perhaps even more) and Mach 9 speed, the ""Zircon"" is over 3 times faster and its range is at least double that of the P-800 ""Oniks"" supersonic missiles originally used by the aforementioned platform, further enhancingRussia's already unprecedented long-range strike capabilities(to both the Neo-Nazi junta's and NATO's horror, as previously mentioned).

This has become even more noticeable in the aftermath of the Crocus City Hall terrorist attack, as the Russian military is now hunting forthe organizers, both the Kiev regime's intelligence services and their NATO overlords. With such a range (at least 1500 km or possibly even beyond 2000 km),the usage of ""Zircon"" allows Moscow to target any location on the territory of Ukraine. However, it should be noted that the Eurasian giant always had this ability. The difference now is that it can do so much faster and with far less warning time. The usage of air-launched and ground-based hypersonic missile systems such as the 9-A-7660 ""Kinzhal"" and ""Iskander-M""is still very much relevant, as evidenced by thelatest elimination of high-ranking NATO officers(although their deaths will surely be attributed to ""sudden"" skiing accidents).

However, the ""Iskander-M"" can use a massive 700 kg HE warheadthat is best used against frontline targets and higher concentrations of troopsin the rear. Virtually the same goes for much faster ""Kinzhal"" missiles. In addition,these can sometimes be detected by NATO ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) assets, particularly airborne and space-based, giving the Neo-Nazi junta officers and their foreign ""advisers"" just enough time to run away (albeit not much and certainly not always). The launch of an ""Iskander"" can be detected by early warning systems, while ISR can pick up the MiG-31K/I deployment.This information can be relayed to the Kiev regime or any NATO personnel on the ground.On the other hand, detecting a scramjet-powered ""Zircon"" can be a lot more problematic.

Then the numbers come into play:

– Kiev: 3 minutes 30 seconds;

– Lvov: 5 minutes 20 seconds;

– Dnepropetrovsk: 2 minutes 30 seconds;

– Vinnitsa: 3 minutes 40 seconds;

– Kharkov: less than 4 minutes;

– Odessa: less than 1 minute.

Imagine being an officer of the SBU, GUR (Neo-Nazi junta's military intelligence) or some of the NATO occupation forces.You're stationed in a building, living in the illusion that you're safe when the Russian SVR or GRU learns about your location and relays this information to units in Crimea who then fire a ""Zircon"" at that building.This is how much time you'd have before impact.However, let's consider the best-case scenario and imagine that NATO ISR assets detect the missile immediately after launch (which is extremely improbable). This is how much time you'd have to evacuate. Is it possible to run away in time? Certainly, but that doesn't mean it's very likely. On the contrary, the sheer panic resulting from a warning would surely make the evacuation a lot more difficult.The same goes for the ""Kinzhal"" and ""Iskander"" missile launches.

However, the primary reason why the ""Zircon"" is a lot more dangerous for high-value targets (HVTs) in the rear is because it has a much smaller warhead (around 300 kg), meaning that the Russian military is more likely to use it in long-range strikes. Firing an ""Iskander"" or ""Kinzhal"" could cause unacceptable damage to purely civilian infrastructure in the surrounding areas, both due to their larger and more destructive warheads, particularly in the case of ""Kinzhal"",with the speed also giving it massive kinetic energy.That's why these more destructive missile systems are far likelier to be used against purely military targets such aslarge troop concentrationsand important hostile equipment,particularly SAM (surface-to-air missile) systemsandMLRS (multiple launch rocket systems) known to use PGMs(precision-guided munitions), etc.

On the other hand, precisely because of the large-scale deployment of ""Zircon"" missiles,Russia has more options to strike decision-making centers in Ukraine.This explainsthe panic in NATO and the Pentagon, which are now in a dilemma about how to ensure the safety of their occupation forces in Ukraine. I suggest everyone watch closely for news about the ""sudden deaths"" of NATO officers in various ""freak accidents"" in the coming days and weeks. We might soon learn about American, Polish or some other NATO majors, colonels and even generals ""mysteriously"" and ""inexplicably"" dying while skiing in the Alps, falling out of helicopters, choking on croissants while having breakfast or suffocating when their throats swell from hot coffee, etc. Still, the Kiev regime insists there's nothing to worry about,as it can ""shoot down anything"".

Namely,according to their latest claims, they've ""shot down at least two 'Zircon' missiles"". Expectedly, the Neo-Nazi junta insists they've achieved this with ""US-made missile defense systems over Kyiv, on March 25"". I presume we can proceed now that you're done laughing and catching your breath. The report never named any system specifically, but it can be assumed that future claims will attribute the supposed ""kill"" to the atrociously overhyped ""Patriot"" SAM that has beenfailing everywhere for the last 30+ years, even against rather primitive ballistic missiles, but is ""suddenly so successful"" against the latest hypersonic ones.In addition, it's rather interesting how they can ""achieve"" that, but have been absolutely helpless against over 300 P-800 ""Oniks"" missiles.Not a single one has been shot down, despite being 3-4 times slower and less maneuverable than the ""Zircon"".

2024-04-01 02:45:00,27.6 Million People Are Currently In Forced Labor,https://web.archive.org/web/20240401112021/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/276-million-people-are-currently-forced-labor#comment-stream,"27.6 million people were living under the conditions of forced labor around the world on any given day in 2021, according todatapublished in a report on Tuesday by the International Labor Organization (ILO).

As Statista's Anna Fleck reports,this equates to roughly 3.5 people for every 1,000 people worldwide and is an 11 percent increase since 2016,when there were 24.9 million people living in forced labor (3.4 people per 1,000 population). The vast majority of these are thought to have been in privately-imposed forced labor (23.6 million in 2021), rather than state-imposed forced labor (3.9 million in 2021).

The report, titled 'Profits and poverty: The economics of forced labor', reveals the extent to which forced labor is a global issue.At 15.1 million, Asia and the Pacific had by far the highest number of people living in forced laborin 2021, accounting for more than half of the global total. Europe and Central Asia was the region with the second biggest absolute number at 4.1 million people, followed by Africa with 3.8 million, the Americas with 3.6 million and the Arab States with 900,000 people living under these conditions.

When looking at prevalence, a different order emerges:the Arab States were the worst offending group of countriesthat year (5.3 people in forced labor per 1,000 population), followed by Europe and Central Asia (4.4 people per 1,000 population), Asia and the Pacific (3.5 people per 1,000 population), the Americas (3.5 people per 1,000 population) and Africa (2.9 people per 1,000 population).

And theeconomic scale of illegal forced labor profitsis vast.

Forced labor is estimated to generate illegal profits summing to $236 billion in 2024 alone,with exploiters making at average of $9,995 per victim. This is according to a newreportby the International Labor Organization (ILO), released Tuesday. This profit represents the wages that “rightfully belong in the pockets of workers that instead remain in the hands of their exploiters as a result of their coercive practices.” It is even a low estimate, since the ILO does not include further illegal profits made through means such as recruitment fees or the money from avoided taxes. Forced labor is here defined as “work that is both involuntary and under penalty or menace of coercion”.

As Statista's Anna Fleck shows in the following chart,sexual exploitation is the biggest driver of forced labor profits, accounting for some $172.6 billion worldwide in 2024. This breaks down to a significant amount in all regions, at $58.6 billion in Europe and Central Asia, $48.4 billion in Asia and the Pacific, $34.9 billion in the Americas, $16.1 billion in Africa and $14.6 billion in the Arab States.

You will find more infographics atStatista

Despite making up nearly three quarters (73 percent) of the total illegal profits from forced labor, sexual exploitation accounts for only 27 percent of all people in privately imposed forced labor (i.e. not including state-imposed forced labor).Some of the other major areas for illegal forced labor are industry (including mines and quarrying, manufacturing, construction and utilities), the services sector (including but not limited to wholesale and trade, accommodation and food service activities, transport and storage), the agriculture sector (forestry, hunting, cultivation of crops, livestock production and fishing) and domestic work (in third party households).

According to the ILO’s calculations,illegal profits for forced labor have increased by some $64 billion since 2014 worldwide.This is the result of both more people in forced labor (23.7 million in 2024 versus 18.7 million in 2014) as well as more illegal profit being generated per victim.

2024-04-01 03:30:00,Did The US First Catch Wind Of The Crocus Terrorist Attack By Spying On Kiev?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240401112021/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/did-us-first-catch-wind-crocus-terrorist-attack-spying-kiev,"Authored by Andrew Korybko via eestieest.com,

TheNew York Times(NYT) cited unnamed sources on Thursday to report that “The adversarial relationship between Washington and Moscow prevented U.S. officials from sharing any information about the (Crocus terrorist attack) plot beyond what was necessary,out of fear Russian authorities might learn their intelligence sources or methods.” This vindicates President Putin, who the West hithertoclaimed had downplayed terrorist threatsin the run-up toone of the worst attacksin Russian history.

Without actionable intelligence and informed only of the US’ vague warning that large gatherings like concerts could soon be targeted,his security services were unable to stop the plotters,thus meaning that Washington is partially responsible for what happened by withholding specific information about it. Just as scandalously, this bombshell also prompted speculation about the exact sources and methods that America employed to first catch wind of this attack.

While it’s possible that the US learned about this from spying on the radical Telegram channel whose curators reportedly recruited the culprits, such as if the CIA had a mole inside that preacher’s team,the case can compellingly be made that this might have actually been brought to its attention by spying on Kiev.Last spring’s Pentagon leaks confirmed that the US has been spying on Zelensky, which Ukrainian officials toldCNNwas “unsurprising” but still left them “deeply frustrated”.

Those documents also confirmed that the US was spying on Ukraine’s military-intelligence service GUR as well,from whom they learned about a plotto attack the Russian port of Novorossiysk on the first anniversary of thespecialoperationand then ordered them to stand down to avoid provoking Moscow. Seeing as how theWashington Post(WaPo) reported half a year later that the CIA rebuilt the GUR from the ground-up after 2014, it’s obvious that they embedded moles within that institution from the get-go.

They don’t always learn about terrorist plots ahead of time since their infiltration of the GURand other Ukrainian government agencies isn’t total, but they’re still usually able to conclude sometime afterwards that Kiev was responsible whenever a serious attack happens in Russia. Such was the case last May when the NYTreportedthat Kiev was responsible for theKremlin drone attack, in which piece they also reminded their reader that it was behind other attacks up until that point too.

These include the assassinations ofDarya DuginaandVladlen Tatarsky, cross-border terrorist raids into Russia’sBelgorod Region, and theNord Stream II bombing. About that last-mentioned one, the claim of Ukrainian complicity might very well be apreplanned red herringfor deflecting from American involvement after Seymour Hersh served as the conduit for dissident members of the Intelligence Community (IC) to inform the public that their country was the one that ordered that attack.

Nevertheless, what’s important to note in this larger narrative context is thattheWall Street Journalclaimed last summer that the US learned about Ukraine’s plans to blow up that pipeline from Dutch sources and then told Kiev to not to go through with it.Irrespective of whether Ukraine really was involved and despite however the US allegedly obtained the information, not to mention whether that even happened, the point is that IC wanted Americans to know that it told Ukraine to stand down.

WaPothen reported last November that a former senior official from GUR coordinated the Nord Stream II bombing with more senior officials, who supposedly took orders from former Commander-in-Chief Valery Zaluzhny, and all of this purportedly went on behind Zelensky’s back. It’s unimportant whether any of that is true since the significance lies in the fact that IC-connected WaPo introduced this narrative into the global discourse of ostensibly rogue members of the Ukrainian IC plotting such major attacks.

To recap everything that’s been shared thus far by the Mainstream Media:the US spies on Zelensky, the GUR, and other Ukrainian institutions; they’ve learned via these means that Kiev was responsible for prior terrorist attacks; sometimes they catch wind of them ahead of time and order their proxies to stand down; which succeeded in February 2023 when Ukraine then decided not to attack Novorossiysk; but failed in summer 2022 after putatively rogue members of the Ukrainian IC then bombed Nord Stream II.

With this in mind, suspicions that the US withheld possibly actionable intelligence about the then-impending Crocus terrorist attack in order to not reveal their Ukrainian sources and methods make a lot more sense. TheFSB and Security Council chiefsalready suspected Ukrainian involvement, President Putin informed the nation that the terrorists’ contacts in that country had prepared a “window” for them to cross the border, and investigatorsjust discovered evidencethat Kiev paid them via cryptocurrency.

The Deputy Chairman of Turkiye’s ruling party alsorecently saidthat “It is obvious that it is impossible to carry out such a professional action without the support of intelligence of any state.Such events always have sponsors, lobbies that want the (Ukrainian) war to continue.” Seeing as how his country is a NATO member, arms Ukraine, votes against Russia at the UN, and doesn’t recognize Crimea’s reunification, there are no reasons to suspect that he has ulterior motives so his words should be taken seriously.

In the face of these allegations, the US feverishly doubled down on its claim that Ukraine wasn’t responsible, which Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov described as“suspiciously” “obsessive”. His spokeswoman Maria Zakharova had earlier described Bloomberg’s report that Kremlin insiders doubt Ukraine’s involvement, which was arguably an IC-planted narrative deflection, as “the mother of all fakes.” The trend is that the US is desperately trying to convince everyone that Kiev wasn’t responsible.

All of this suggests thatthe US knows that Ukraine was involved but fears what Russia might do once the evidence becomes indisputable.For instance, this could then be shared with the world for justifying the legal transformation of Russia’s special operation into an all-out war, which could precede another offensive. A breakthrough might eventually occur and the government could collapse soon thereafter exactly as theUkrainian Intelligence Committeewarned in late February might happen by this summer.

This insight adds context to the NYT’s bombshell since it might very well have been that the CIA learned about the Crocus plot by spying on its GUR protégés, which this analysishereexplains how they could have orchestrated everything, but then told them to call it off. Just like the GUR reportedly delayed the Nord Stream II bombing, so too does it seem in hindsight like it delayed this bloodbath, only to later carry out both irrespective of whether they were formally approved or done by rogue IC members.

The aforesaid version of events accounts for why the US only passed along vague information to Russia since it assumed that the GUR wouldn’t go through with the Crocus plot, butWashington still wanted to discredit its rival’s government and security services,ergo its embassy’s provocative warning at the time. After the terrorist attack happened and evidence began piling up of Ukraine’s involvement, the US swiftly ran interference for its proxies because it fears the consequences of Russia’s possible military reaction.

It’s unclear what those members of the US IC that spoke to the NYT were thinking when they told that outlet to report that their services withheld details of the then-impending Crocus terrorist attack from Russia in order to not betray their sources and methods, but the larger narrative context within which this pivotal detail entered the global discourse casts more aspersions on Ukraine.It seems increasingly obvious that Kiev was involved, and it’s likely only a matter of time before a smoking gun is found.

2024-04-01 05:00:00,"More Inflation, More Copper Theft",https://web.archive.org/web/20240401112021/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/more-inflation-more-copper-theft,"When unemployment and inflation cause skyrocketing incentives for thieves to steal industrial metals like copper,criminals rush for some of the biggest sources: critical infrastructure.That includes cell towers, water pipes, street lights, andrail lines. These copper heists threaten transportation, communication, municipal services, urban safety, and other essentials of modern life.

The chaos they can cause can cost lives, too— for example, copper heists from railways can cause warning lights, intersection gates, and turnouts that divert trains to other tracks to go offline.

World Bank analystsestimated that pricesfor base metals like copper and tin had peaked last year, and will decline further in 2024. Some reasons they cited included improving supply and decreasing demand due to widespread adoption of green energy initiatives, and a 52% reduction in the coal price in 2023 compared to the previous year. The report noted that high inflation will reduce demand, will it be enough to offset the speed at which fiat currencies are drained of their purchasing power? So far, the answer appears to be no.

If dollar inflation continues sufficiently unabated,the relative price of copper could continue to rise despite other factors. Other unexpected wrenches in the economy, like the recent closure of thePort of Baltimore, could also challenge the World Bank’s predictions.The Port of Baltimore was one of the US’s main exporters of coal,which could cause upward pressure on the global price of energy in an already-inflationary environment, and make metal smelting operations more expensive.

Copper futures dipped in May, after the World Bank released its report, but rose to a higher low in February, and have since been trending upward:

Copper Futures (USD/Lbs), April 2023 – March 2024

And as metal prices soar, so haveincidents of theftthat damage crucial infrastructure and multiply existing economic damage.Freight train accidents and delays, power and cellular blackouts, municipal sewer damage, and flooding and drainage issues from stolen gutters and pipes are just a few of the problems caused by 2024’ssurging copper theftacross America and the world.

Even real estate development projects can go over budget or become severely delayed when thieves snatch copper building materials from construction sites. The problem is so bad that in Los Angeles, a city councilmember declared the city is being “stripped” like an abandoned car:

Also at risk areelectric vehicle charging stations, which have been proliferating around the country. Although they only contain a small amount of copper that can be extracted, meaning very little profit for thieves, their opportunistic mischief requires an expensive fix — especially for EV stations that are repeatedly targeted and need to be continually repaired or replaced.

One other underappreciated danger for copper when prices are skyrocketing due to economic uncertainty:inside jobsby bad apples at copper suppliers and storage facilities,which can lead to thefts on a grand enough scale that they affect the broader metals market. When they do, it helps incentivize further waves of small-time theft that damage infrastructure and victimize businesses that rely on the metal.

Angela Seidler is a PR representative for Europe’s number one copper producer in Germany which was caught in one such scandal. She explained to Bloomberg:

“What we currently know is that some of our recycling suppliers appear to have manipulated details about the raw materials they deliver to us, and they have been working with employees in our sampling department to hide the shortfall.”

And when thieves are desperate, nothing is sacred. Not even statues ofcivil rights leadersor copperheadstones in graveyardsare safe from the temptation of an easy flip when prices are too high for criminals to ignore. And while these sorts of thefts don’t endanger infrastructure,they’re a sign of the times and a unique indicator that the US dollar and economy are in troubled shape.

2024-04-01 05:45:00,"Ranking The World's Most Popular Beers, By Generation",https://web.archive.org/web/20240401112021/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/ranking-worlds-most-popular-beers-generation#comment-stream,"What are the most popular beers by US generation?Visual Capitalist's Marcus Lu has delved into the data based on a consumer survey conducted byYouGovwhich looks at whatMillennials, GenX, and Baby Boomers like to consume the most.

The “popularity” metric represents the % of people who had a positive opinion of that beer. Note that YouGov surveys are conducted with a representative sample of 1,500 respondents.

U.S. millennials appear to favor foreign beers, with the top five spots taken by Dutch (Heineken) or Mexican beers (Modelo,Corona).

While not exactly a beer,White Claws(which have a similar alcohol content) claimed sixth place. Hard seltzers have become very popular in recent years due to their variety of flavors, attractive packaging, and relatively low amount of carbs and calories.

Gen X also has a strong preference for foreign beers, particularly Guinness(fun fact: Over 31 million Americans claim to be ofIrish descent).

Two American beers that weren’t on Millennials’ top 10 list areSamuel AdamsandBlue Moon.

Samuel Adams is the flagship brand of the Boston Beer Company, named after U.S. Founding Father Samuel Adams. On the other hand, Blue Moon is a Belgian-style witbier brewed by Molson Coors.

Boomers’ top 10 favorite beers are similar to Gen X, with a few key differences. One is the absence ofModelo, which ranked second and fourth for Millennials and Gen X, respectively.

Modelo (which became America’s best-selling beer in 2023) has focused its advertising efforts on sports, which may not reach Boomers as effectively as younger generations.

An interesting pick for Boomers isDos Equis, which is produced by Heineken-owned Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma Brewery. The brand gained popularity for its “most interesting man in the world” commercials, which ran from 2006 to 2018.

2024-04-01 06:30:00,No Fooling: Gov. Newsom's $20 Minimum Wage Hits April 1,https://web.archive.org/web/20240401112021/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/no-fooling-gov-newsoms-20-minimum-wage-hits-april-1#comment-stream,"Authored by John Seiler via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

I wish we could call “April fool!” on the $20 minimum wage hitting California fast-food restaurants on April 1.But the wage hikesignedinto law last September by Gov. Gavin Newsom is really going to hit hard.

Last December,Pizza Hut announced it wouldlay offmore than 1,200 delivery drivers across the state. It switched to independent deliver services for home delivery. On March 25, the Wall Street Journalreportedon driver Michael Ojeda, 29, “who previously supported his mother and partner on his Pizza Hut delivery wages.” He told the paper, “Pizza Hut was my career for nearly a decade and with little to no notice it was taken away.”

Round Table Pizza also laid off 73 drivers. And, “In San Jose, Brian Hom, owner of two Vitality Bowls restaurants, now runs his stores with two employees, versus four workers that he typically used in the past. That meansit takes longer to make customers’ açaí bowls and other orders, and Hom said he is also raising prices by around 10 percent to help cover the increased labor costs. ”

Mr. Hom said,“I’m definitely not going to hire anymore.”

The $20 wage increase affects only chains with 60 or more restaurants nationwide. One effect might be to discourage national chains from setting up here. If a chain has, for example, 55 restaurants outside California, it would be hesitant to establish five restaurants in the Golden State because that would impact its wage structure everywhere else.

The $7.25 federal minimum wageappliesin 20 states with no higher state wage. If a restaurant company operating in those states expanded to California, the disparity between $7.25 and $20 would be a shock to the company.

Another big effect will be on all other California businesses, not just restaurants with fewer than 60 operations nationwide.The state minimum wage overall went up fifty cents to $16 an hour on Jan. 1. The best workers at $16 will gravitate to the $20 jobs, effectively putting pressure on companies to pay more than $16. Companies that can’t do so will go out of business.

We won’t know for a couple of months, butCalifornia’s unemployment rate could go much higher.Accordingto the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the state’s unemployment already has risen from 5.0 percent last September to 5.3 percent in February, thehighestin the nation. The next highest is Nevada at 5.2 percent. Rival Texas is 3.9 percent and Florida is 3.1 percent.

Higher unemployment also will raise costs for the state’s troubled Employment Development Department. Due to incompetence by the Newsom administration, massive fraud during COVID-19 left the state $20 billion in debt to the federal government. Worse,reportedCalifornia Globe on Feb. 29,higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve Board mean “the state can expect to have to make an interest only payment of about $500 million dollars instead of the $330 million that was planned forin Gov. Gavin Newsom’s budget for fiscal 2024-25,” which begins on July 1. It must be paid in September.

Mr. Newsom can be a savvy politician. But he has a problem with economic realities. For eight years as lieutenant governor, he sat at the feet of Gov. Jerry Brown, who demonstrated how to prevent a budget from getting out of control. Instead, as governor Mr. Newsom went on spending sprees with the $97 billion surplus, everyone, including him, said couldn’t last. It didn’t.

Now he’s staring down a $38 billion budget deficit, according to his Jan. 10budget proposal; or $73 billion, according to the Legislative Analyst’s latestprojection.

The $20 minimum wage will kill many thousands of jobs, canceling the taxes of those workers while they are unemployed, while increasing unemployment costs. Albeit the $20 wage will bring in higher taxes from the workers still employed.

Employers, commonly in the upper middle-class, will suffer fewer profits, cutting into the income taxes they pay. Many even will call it quits and fold up their businesses, or move to more reasonable states.

All this will hit this summer as Mr.Newsom’s presidential ambitions could still advance should President Joe Biden’s mental faculties decline much further. All that still is a long shot, of course. ThePredictIt bettingon Mr. Newsom gaining the nomination has been decreasing lately (middle line in the graph below), from 18 cents on Feb. 9 to 6 cents on March 29. Mr. Biden’s (top line) rose from 72 cents to 89 cents. Vice President Kamala Harris finished at 4 cents, below Mr. Newsom.

The point is it’s not impossible Mr. Newsom could get the nomination. If he does, California’s rising unemployment rate, the massive budget deficit, homelessness, high housing costs, and crime will be a target-rich environment for the Republicans’ presumptive nominee: former President Donald Trump.

Mr. Newsom could have avoided the unemployment crisis if he simply had pushed the $20 minimum wage into the future to 2027, when he will be out office. Then it would have been the next governor’s problem.

A higher minimum wage usually kills jobs, unless it is genuinely in line with an area’s cost of living. The current statewide $16 minimum wage is the second-highest of any state in the country, after Washington state’s $16.28. And Washington, D.C., not a state, is the highest at $17.00. All are areas with high expenses.

The biggest problem for California will be the $20 wage in rural areas.Although not as cheap to live in as Mississippi, it’s cheaper than living in San Francisco or Santa Monica. Which also means a lower minimum wage would be more sensible inland. Instead, the $20 wage will wipe out many more fast food jobs per capita inland than in the coastal areas.

The $20 wage is also going to increase prices for those still going to fast-food places. If inflation continues or gets worse, that will boost prices even more, leading to fewer customers, followed by even more layoffs.

Tinkering with the economy has consequences. Starting on April Fools’ Day, California will be finding out how an excessive minimum wage increase is one of the worst ones.

ResiClub founder Lance Lambertwrote on X that the ""US Southeast, Mountain West, East/central Texas"" had counties with some of the largest population gains over the period. Conversely, the counties based in California, the North and South Great Plains, parts of the Inland Midwest, and the inland Northeast had some of the most significant outflows.

The BEA reports real income is down, but personal spending jumped anyway. Inflation data is mostly as expected, but much higher than the Fed would like to see.

Personal Income and Outlays, February 2024

Nothing about the BEA’sPersonal Income and Outlaysreport for February 2024 suggests the Fed should cut interest rates at its next meeting.

The Fed wants inflation at 2.0 percent. 0.3 percent per month times 12 months won’t come close to getting there.

You can twist the analysis however you want but you cannot twist the math.

Real Income and Spending Percent Change

Nominal spending was up 0.8 percent and real spending was up 0.4 percent. This suggests PCE inflation was on the high side of the range.

Rounded to a single decimal point, the reported 0.3 PCE price index month-over-month can be in the range of 0.25 to 0.34.

The PCE price index for January was 121.906. For February, it was 122.312. That’s a monthly increase of 0.333 percent, on the high end of the range. Multiply that by 12 and you are close to 4.0 percent price inflation annually.

This does not support Fed interest rate cuts.

Apartment List Reports Rent Prices Increase for the Second Month

Yesterday, I notedApartment List Reports Rent Prices Increase for the Second Month

Also noteCase-Shiller National Home Price Index Hits New Record High

Case-Shiller updated is home price data for January this week. Here are the key charts and a discussion of why it’s hard to tell if prices are rising or falling.

The Fed wants to cut in June, and that’s what the market expects (thanks to Fed jawboning), so most likely the Fed will cut unless the data is very hot.

Like Pavlov’s dogs, the market is salivating over rate cuts.

2024-04-01 08:30:16,Are You Ready For the Second Wave of Inflation?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-01/are-you-ready-second-wave-inflation,"Our latest theme is that the U.S. Central Bank, called the Federal Reserve, or the Fed for short, is NOT politically independent, but is in fact a highly partisan organization that leans left.

The above items are not some conspiracy theory. The Fed’s own actions support this view.

By quick way of review…

1) The Bernanke-led Fed launched QE 3 just three months before the 2012 Presidential election. At the time, the economy was growing, unemployment was falling, and there were no signs of systemic duress in the financial system. So this was a clear intervention to aid the Obama Administration’s 2012 re-election bid.

2) The Fed kept rates at zero for seven of the eight years President Obama was in office.  Once it finally got around to raising rates, it engaged in one of the feeblest hiking schedules in history, raising them only once in 2015 and once in 2016.

3) Donald Trump won the 2016 Presidential election in a major upset to the political establishment. At that point the Fed suddenly began raising rates three to four times per year while simultaneously draining $500 billion in liquidity from the financial system.

4) Today, the Fed is actively juicing the stock market via multiple credit facilities designed to provide liquidity to help the Biden administration with its re-election bid. The Fed is also promising to cut rates despite the fact it’s an election year and inflation has not fallen to its 2% target.

I wish this was the end of this disturbing exercise, but it’s not: the Fed is also letting housing bubble up again. The reason? You guessed it, real estate is the single most owned asset class in the U.S. And boosting home prices during an election year is likely to sway voters.

TheS&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index rose 6% in January. This is up from 5.6% in December 2023. AsHousingWirenotes, this represents the seventh consecutive month of annual price growth. It’s also the biggest increase since November 2022.

By the way, inflation was around 6% at that time!

So we’ve got both real estate and stocks bubbling up again, courtesy of the Fed playing political games. In the near-term this is fantastic for Americans, who will see their net worth rise as a result of this.

The bad news is that there’s no such thing as a free lunch. And the Fed’s political shenanigans are unleashing a second wave of inflation.

Gold has figured it out.  It recently exploded to new all-time highs.

The good news is that those investors who are properly positioned for this stand to generate truly EXTRAORDINARY returns in the coming months.

On that note, the FREE copies of our Special Investment Report detailing three investments that will profit from the next round of inflation are rapidly being reserved. So if you want reserve one, you better move fast!

2024-04-01 09:14:48,Bitcoin Redundancy Realizations,https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-01/bitcoin-redundancy-realizations,"Submitted byQTR's Fringe Finance

When I think about the key concepts that I’ve learned about Bitcoin over the last month or two, there wasn’t one that pushed me over the line to be a believer more than the function of the network's redundancy.

I mean, sure, almost everybody that knows me knows that ideologically, I’m a huge proponent of Austrian economics and an enormous gold bull, so obviously, that’s a great foundation to come from if you want to start learning about, and then believing in, Bitcoin.

But a lot of my uncertainty about Bitcoin over the last few years was a result of not understanding what it was or how it worked with definitive clarity. Those who watchedmy interview last month with Peter McCormackknow that in the first half hour, I was challenging him to give me a one-sentence description of what you’re buying when you buy Bitcoin. I am still thirsty to be able to simplify the concepts of Bitcoin, thereby making it more digestible not only for myself to understand and explain, but for others.

For the record, if I had to answer that question now, I would simply describe buying Bitcoin as exchanging one currency for another. The price represents the exchange rate. I know there is more to it than this, including the potential for more adoption and a broader technological use for the network, among other things, but to simplify it, I’d just say it is the world's first digital currency, accessible worldwide, and the price is its exchange rate. It’s a digital unicode for money.

And you don’t really need to know the down and dirty details of how it works, only that itdoeswork, and that, as it grows, it becomes more secure. For those unfamiliar with how the proof of work security works, here’s an easy analogy that computer nerds will get mad about because its not accurate enough. Think of a four digit combination lock you use to lock up your bike in the city. Now, imagine if every time you used the lock, one digit was added to the lock and the combination reset to a new number. The last user gives you the 4 digit code to unlock the bike lock soyoucan use it. After your use, instead of having four digit lock with 1000 possible answers, you now have an all new,fivedigit combination, with 10x as many possible combinations. You give that combination to the next user sotheycan use it. Now, multiply that transaction by all of the times someone has used your lock, and you’ll see very quickly thatwhateverthe combination is today, its very long — and nobody is going to be able to guess it. And, as more people use it, the lock becomeseven more secure.

Now, imagine you have20,000 people all using that same lockto lock up their bikes, non-stop for 13 years.

Understanding bitcoin’s security is one of the simple and profound realizations that I had that offered me permission to start to believe in it. I’ve said in an article Iwrote earlier this yearthat Bitcoin is the digital manifestation of the phrase “there’s safety in numbers.”

But there isn’t just safety, there’s also strength and...(READ THIS FULL ARTICLE, FREE, HERE).

2024-04-01 17:19:40,How We Can Fix Our Money,https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-01/how-we-can-fix-our-money,"How We Can Fix Our Money

Creating An Uncorruptible Currency

If we are to successfully address how to fix our money, the first consideration is the political factor because of its power to derail us.  Consider the following question carefully.Would you rather have political democracy or economic democracy to back up your bid for an honest economy?  Which will serve you better?This will help us focus our minds on what will be most effective.

Let us first consider political democracy.  What is it?  Basically, it is the vote.Events of history make it abundantly clear exactly what it is.  It has been described as two wolves and a sheep deciding what to have for lunch.  It was identified over 2500 years ago in Plato’sThe Republicwhich was his dissertation on all the known forms of government.  The main currency of political democracy is the vote and its power is the voice of the majority.  There are a great many problems with democracy as a political system of governance that our present circumstances make abundantly clear:

Economic democracy is quite different.  In essence, it is we the people voting with our dollars for what we want.The present order of things has corrupted even this basic framework with political distortions:

An unsung hero who is arguably the greatest economist who ever lived is Clifford Hugh Douglas and his claim to fame is an economic framework that has come to be known as the Social Credit system.  This is not that notorious Chinese big-brother money tracking system that I believe has been deliberately assigned the English title of “social credit” to discredit the original.  There are two fundamental principles Douglas laid down as the foundation of his proposals.He said that systems were made for man; men were not made for systems.Amen to that.He also said the economic system that is best is the one that is capable of delivering the goods and services desired by society as, when and where needed at the lowest possible price.Amen to that too.  Here is a brief but well written introduction description of social credit written by two of the movement’s insiders:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_credit

All things being equal, if we had a properly functioning and incentivized economy that operated on these basic principles, then the preferred democracy would be economic democracy because the goods that would be offered to us would be the goods we actually vote for with our currency.  As a consequence, most of the rest of society’s other problems (e.g. welfare, social security, public works, medical care, and all those things that under our present system, we “can’t afford”) would sort themselves out.

To meet these two foundational goals of Douglas, we need to solve a couple of pressing problems.  The principal problem is the fact that the issue of our money – fiat currency – is entirely in the control of international banksters who issue that money as debt.  The ability to create money out of thin air is indeed an awesome power and that is the power they have.  With it, they can sway our elected officials, bribe our public servants, suppress technologies that would improve the lives of all of us, distort markets (i.e. monopolies and cabals) to maximize their own profits and generally make our lives much more miserable than is necessary.  Life has enough challenges without some nameless, faceless sociopath with his boot on our collective necks.  In essence, all of humanity is in debt slavery.Even the super-rich must tow the line, or they lose the support of the real masters of the world and fall from their lofty perch.  Witness what has happened to billionaire Donald Trump.  Witness the murder of some of our greatest leaders of the past century; JFK, MLK, RFK, Senator Wellstone, Louis T, McFadden, and many others who dared to cross these enemies of humanity.The second problem is the corruption of our political representatives and the present cast of government employees we know as the Deep State that need to be routed out.

Alas, it is not up to us individually to single-handedly take on this task but collectivelywe can do more than nothing.  And we are.  Consider a well-oiled machine of immense power; able to crush rocks into rubble.All that is needed to bring this machine down is to just covertly keep throwing a little sand into the gears and watch it grind to a halt.  This is happening even now with a phenomenon we call silent quitting.  It is the work-to-rule mentality that is seizing many and causing them to give only the bare minimum necessary to hold onto their jobs.  It is thousands of farmers driving their tractors to government capitals and slinging manure at the buildings.  It is truckers blocking routes and assembling in protest, bringing the economy to a halt.  It is states sending national guard troops to Texas to help secure the border.  It is truckers refusing to deliver loads to problem jurisdictions that are oppressing our best and brightest.  We saw Ghandi bring the mighty British Empire – the only empire in all of history on which the sun never set – to the point that they gave up, left and granted the people of India their own home rule.  We saw the Solidarity movement of Lech Walesa bring the communist government of Poland to its knees and forced its leader to resign.  This was the first domino to fall that led to the collapse of the USSR.  Yes, collectively we can do more than nothing.

But then if we are to do “something” about it, then what shall that something be?

We all understand that TPTB (the powers that be) are deliberately sabotaging our money and our nation.  We realize that they are inflating our currency to eventual worthlessness, and we can see that other governments in the world see it too.  It is for this reason that the BRICS nations are planning their own commodities-backed currency to use instead of the $USD.  This is the “raisond'être” for sound money advocates like C4SM (www.citizens4soundmoney.org) and it is the reason why Kinesis and other bullion-backed crypto hard monies were formed.  However, as you will soon see, it is not enough to fix the money.  The repair must go deeper.The purpose of this paper is to do just that and to propose an economic framework that will solve the bigger problems.  It is a solution that dovetails perfectly with what we all stand for – sound money, but it foresees the next step too.  After all, who was it who said, “A people without vision will surely perish?”

As you read this, I understand many if not most of us no longer trust our political institutions or media, and with good reason.  If there is to be some kind of new money system, we are all greatly concerned with the answer to the question,who gets to make the decisions as to who gets what and who has the control?The whole point of this paper is to demonstrate that it is possible that control can be completely decentralized, and government can be completely cut out of the loop.So who has the control?  We the People.What is the mechanism of our control?  We vote for everything with our dollars.Who do we bring under control?  Governments and big business.

Finally, I want to address – head on – the assertion that several people have already expressed to me that this is socialism.  That couldn’t be farther from the truth.First, we already have socialism.  Every single plank of the Communist Manifesto is in place in all of the G7 nations and throughout most of the world.  We call it welfare and food stamps and social security and other “free lunch” and pork barrel spending.This proposal eliminates that portion of the federal government’s expenditures that compriseover halfits total spending.Second, the dividend I am going to reveal shortly is exactly like a corporate dividend.  If the company doesn’t make a profit, there are no dividends.  If the economy does not produce enough to generate a gap, there will be no basis for a dividend and so there will be none paid out.  If as you read this paper, you too come to the conclusion that it is socialism, come back to this paragraph, read it again and then prove to yourself that it just isn’t so.  Because it isn’t so!There is no free lunch.There will be nothing to consume if nothing is produced.  It’s that simple.This is in fact the most honest form of capitalism that is possible.  Douglas described it as “An aristocracy of producers serving a democracy of consumers.”  Consumers vote with their dollars and producers who deliver the best products at the best prices profit handsomely.

CH Douglas was a brilliant man.  He reducedthe fatal flaw of our economic system to a simple algebraic expression that has come to be known as theA + B Theorem.  You must now ask yourself why you never learned about this in public school or institutions of higher learning, although thousands of books have been written about it and indeed governments have been formed in its name.

A theory is an explanation of a problem for which there isnoevidence.For example, is light a particle or a wave?  A theorem, however, is a much stronger explanation of a problem for which there is no completed work that proves it but for which there is compelling empirical evidence.  The dictionary defines it as “An idea that has been demonstrated as true or is assumed to be so demonstrable.” or “A proposition that has been or is to be proved on the basis of explicit assumptions.”Here is the theorem:

A =all wages, earnings and dividends(i.e. real money that lands in the pockets of real people and that they can spend to buy the goods and services that have a price) paid to employees, business owners and shareholders respectively.

B =all other coststhat include but are not limited to raw materials, capital machinery, buildings, real estate, transportation, professional services, utilities, depreciation, etc.

Here is a simple example to illustrate.  Starbucks charges a price of $4 for a coffee.  Of that, half of the money goes to shareholders as dividends, and compensation to all of the employees of the corporation.  Those are A costs.  The other half goes to pay all of its costs of bringing that coffee to you in the first place; the purchase of coffee beans and supplies such as the equipment to brew the coffee, cup, sugar, cream, stir sticks, store rent, trucking to get the stuff there, accounting fees to meet regulatory requirements, payment of taxes, etc.  Those are B costs.

Reflect on this for a moment.  Is there anything else that goes into price?  Anything that you can think of ultimately falls into the A or B bucket.  No, there are exceptions.  For price to be comprised of only A or only B, the other factor would need to be zero.  That is basic algebra.  Can you think of any business that has only one of these components in the good or service they offer?  It is empirically obvious that this theorem is true.

This leads to the following critical conclusion.  If it is impossible for A to equal price and if it is only A that is available to consumers to purchase the goods and services of the nation, then how is it possible for all that merchandise represented by gross domestic product (GDP) to be consumed?Is it not obvious that there is a shortage of purchasing power built into our economies?  Does it matter if the nation is a democracy, a dictatorship, an oligarchy, or a monarchy?  Every economy suffers under the same fundamental flaw.  We call this shortage “the gap.”Even the oft-quoted John Maynard Keynes admitted that there is a gap.  He described it thus in 1936 in his book,The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money[i]:

Consumption is satisfied partly by objects produced currently, and partly by objects produced previously, i.e., by disinvestment. To the extent that consumption is satisfied by the latter there is a contraction of current demand, since to that extent a part of current expenditures fails to find its way back as a part of net income. Contrariwise, whenever an article is produced within the period with a view to satisfying consumption subsequently, an expansion of current demand is set up.  Now all capital investment is destined to result, sooner or later, in capital disinvestment.Thus the problem of providing that new capital investment shall always outrun capital disinvestment sufficiently to fillthegapbetween net income and consumption,presents a problem which is increasingly difficult as capital increases.New capital investment can only take place in excess of current capital disinvestment if future expenditure on consumption is expected to increase. Each time we secure today's equilibrium by increased investment we are aggravating the difficulty of securing equilibrium tomorrow.

The great Winston Churchill was baffled by the seemingly mysterious inability of economies to find stability when he said in 1930:

Who would have thought that it would be easier to produce by toil and skill all the most necessary or desirable commodities than it is to find Consumers for them? Who would have thought that cheap and abundant supplies of all the basic commodities would find the science and civilization of the world unable to utilize them?Have all our triumphs of research and organization bequeathed us only a new punishment: the Curse of Plenty?Are we really to believe that no better adjustment can be made between supply and demand? Yet the fact remains that every attempt has failed.Many various attempts have been made, from the extremes of Communism in Russia to the extremes of Capitalism in the United States. They include every form of fiscal policy and currency policy. But all have failed, and we have advanced little further in this quest than in barbaric times.Surely it is this mysterious crack and fissure at the basis of all our arrangements and apparatus upon which the keenest minds throughout the world should be concentrated.

And yet a century later, this problem has yet to be resolved.  The purpose of this article is to illuminate a way to solve this seemingly intractable problem.

This leads to the next observation.  The critic would say that surely there must be something else afoot here because the very fact that we have a GDP that represents all the goods and services sold in a fiscal period, and that the wages, earnings and dividends paid out admittedly come short of meeting that GDP total.  Indeed, there is.This brings us to a discussion of that thing that is nearest and dearest to our hearts.  Money, or more to the point, sound money!

What is it? How is it created?  How is it destroyed?  Who creates the money?  When you get to the heart of the matter, the core truths about money are both veiled and astounding.  Everything I am about to tell you is things everyone already knows; but may have never considered the implications of.  Let’s look at the boiler plate “truths” we were taught in school that turn out to be blatant lies taught by ignorant parrots who blather the nonsense that they too were taught.

The first lie is that money is the fiat notes we carry around and use to buy stuff.  That is indeed money, but it is notallthe money and it is not the only kind of money.  Indeed, physical fiat banknotes is only a mere fraction of a percent of our money.  Most of it is an accounting figure in an accounting ledger residing in a computer.It is a complete fiction backed by nothing but our faith in it!

Also consider this important question.  What shortages actually exist in this world?Is there a shortage of land for us to live on?  It is a mathematical fact that the entire population of the world can fit on Long Island with six square feet allocated for everyone.  When I fly over America, all I see is endless unoccupied land.  Is there a shortage of building materials?  Even if we built none of our homes out of lumber or concrete, we could use the building materials of our ancestors, cob and adobe and stone.  In other words, we can use dirt!  Any shortage of dirt?  What about food?  All of the world’s food is produced by less than 5% of humanity and technology already exists to produce it with less than 1% of our population.  What about raw materials?  No shortage of that either.  Shortage of cars?  Apparently not.  Shortage of appliances, TVs, or any other consumer good you can imagine?  Apparently not.  What is there an apparent shortage of?  Think about it.

In the seventies we were warned of peak oil, and yet since then, we have produced more oil than all the oil that had been produced to that point.  When I was a young man, we were warned of an impending ice age.  Now we are warned of global warming and told that CO2 – the very building block of the plant kingdom without which we would all die - is causing it.  This is a blatant lie.  We were told we need to vaccinate against a “plandemic” that affected way less than 1% of humanity but has since been revealed to be what many now regard as a bioweapon because it has already killed many millions.  RFK Jr is running on this platform for President and is rapidly gaining in popularity in the polls.  In fifty years, more than half the global number of humans may well be gone and we don’t have the children in the pipeline to replace them because this jab has sterilized most of the young people who took it.  We are told that there is a shortage of workers, even as we are told the economy is stagnating.  Businesses are slowing down and yet we still have a shortage of workers?  When has that ever happened before?  Every recession I can remember was characterized by rising unemployment and resultant economic hardship.  This time is different.  Why?

And yet there is another incongruency that few people have correctly surmised; the second big lie – that we have a shortage of money.When asked why we don’t have universal health care the answer is always the same.  We can’t afford it.  Why do we have poverty in the land of plenty?  Why can’t we solve the problem of pollution? Why is there an energy crisis?  Why do both parents have to work and leave their latchkey children to raise themselves?  Why can’t every gifted child have the opportunity to go to school and reach their maximum potential?The answer is again always the same.  We can’t afford it.  My point is simply this.  The only thing we have a real shortage of is money and that is itself entirely a fiction that has been created in the minds of men!  Even crypto is a fiction.There is no physical coin that I can hold called Bitcoin or Ethereum.  How can there be a shortage?  Well indeed there is but that shortage is entirely artificial and man-made.Of course, the critic will correctly postulate that if we created money in unfettered abundance, we would undermine its value and cause inflation.

TPTB understand this problem and have solved it in a way that few people realize.  All money is issued as debt out of thin air.  All money is retired by the repayment of debt.  All debt money has interest levied against it.All newly created money does not have the interest that is tied to its repayment also issued, so thatthere is a shortage immediately built into even the very creation of money that costs almost nothing to produce!

This fundamental problem is the very precise cause of all economic booms and busts without exception.  A boom occurs when the issue of debt-based money exceeds the retirement of money through debt repayment.  A bust occurs when the issue of new money is less than that debt repayment.We are fast approaching that very latter situation right now.  In the financial press, we call it a lack of liquidity.The point of the busts is that the banksters deliberately cause them, by refusing to loan money and reducing existing credit facilities of their customers.  The reason they do so is that it lets them shake down the rest of us and sweep the collateral that was pledged against those loans into their own pockets.

But if David Rogers Webb is correct about what he tells us in his free book and online videoThe Great Taking, then a new version of the shakedown has been prepared for us to implement the mother of all shakedowns and he says it is right around the corner.  Most people don’t realize that the Great Depression was caused by the simple fact that the Federal Reserve refused to print very much currency.When people went to their banks to withdraw their money, they were told there was no money.  Furthermore, after Roosevelt’s bank holiday, many banks were forced to close by federal edict.Here is the sad part.  Nobody connected the dots because the media didn’t report it!People in general knew so little about how money really works that they couldn’t see it.  Everything old is new again.  Did they teach this history of money to any of you in school?  No?  Me neither.  We can thank the internet that we have people like Webb, Catherine Austin-Fitts, CH Douglas and a host of others to tell us so that at least we can see the shape of this new looming disaster.  Everything old is new again.

If this is fundamentally what is wrong with our present economic system, then it seems to me that the only way we will be able to solve its problems is to do two things:

It’s that simple.  If we know what to demand of our politicians and if no candidates are offered by the mainstream parties, then we need to offer our own candidates.  This is exactly what happened in Alberta Canada during the depression that led to the birth of the social credit political movement.  So how do we get these worthy candidates?  Most Americans don’t understand how our candidates are selected – the precinct system.  They think candidates just magically appear on election day!  No.  We chose them – if we get off our lazy butts and make sure the candidates we field are “our” candidates – not “theirs.”

There is a very telling Bible quote.  They have not because they ask not, or they ask amiss.  They ask for the wrong thing.  Couple that with verse that says the people perish for lack of knowledge.So, what is the fundamental problem?  Education about what the problem is and how to fix it.  That’s it.  That’s all.

So what is the fix?  Glad you asked!  It is economic democracy that is supported by an economic framework that meets CH Douglas’s two stated goals.  It must be a system made for man that delivers all the goods and services needed; as, when and where they are needed and at the lowest possible cost.  It must solve the problem of the gap in a way that gives no advantage to the few at the expense of the many.  It must be fair.

As we consider all of these factors about money we just discussed, there are several things that become apparent.  The first factoris the issue of trust.  Bitcoin has shown us that it is possible to have a money that has no need for trusted institutions.  The problem with trust is that it keeps getting violated.  As long as there are people involved, there will be corruption.  Someone will figure out how to “get an edge” and take advantage of the rest of us.  A workable solution must have this attribute of incorruptibility.  When CH Douglas articulated his solution, he could never satisfactorily come up with a legitimate and incorruptible organization to administer the money system.  Governments don’t work.  Central banks don’t work.  Institutions run by people will never work!

The next thing we need to address is that if we are going to fill the gap we have identified – the shortage of B cost money with which to meet price – we need to determine who gets that money and how it will be distributed.  For the sake of simplicity, I am going to show you two graphics from the bookEconomic Cures They Don’t Want You to Know About(seewww.economiccures.com) to summarize the gap as measured by publicly available statistics for both Canada and the USA.  We can expect that this would be representative of most countries in the world.

If the per-capita gap is this big every year, we can offer a dividend (aconditionallyguaranteed income) that is not based on a debt that burdens the next generation.  Let’s say we offer a dividend of $2000/month for everyone from the age of 18 to death.  Think of the problems we solve.  Over half of the US federal government expenditures go to health care, welfare and social security.  Poof!  Gone!  The numbers above demonstrate that such a dividend is indeed economically viable.  Douglas proposed this and called it the national dividend.  Everyone gets the dividend without exception –ifthe nation’s productivity justifies it.

What do we do to fill the rest of the gap?Douglas’s solution was what he called the compensated price.  Think of how sales tax works.  Now imagine that instead of paying a sales tax, we get a sales credit! We get rewarded for buying what we want.  Who is going to save money in a bank for 1%/year when they can get 10% immediately for buying that stereo they always wanted?  Who is going to save for a rainy day when the dividend ensures there will be no rainy days?

The last challenge is the math that tells us how big the gap is and how this is going to be paid for.  If we issue too much money, that is inflation that undermines everyone’s purchasing power.  If we issue too little, then businesses suffer because their goods or services are stranded in the marketplace for want of effective demand (i.e. purchasing power).The answer proposed by Douglas was what he called the Just Price mechanism.  Here are the basics.  In the broad swath of industrial production, each fiscal period – let’s say a 3-month quarter – the rate of production changes.  New businesses start, some businesses close, some factories need to halt production for maintenance, some businesses suffer material shortages that impact production, and some suffer from labor shortages.  There are many factors.  Let’s say that compared to the last quarter, we produce less stuff.  This means that there is a smaller gap and therefore we need to decrease the sales credit to account for the slow-down in productivity.  In another quarter we have increased production, so we need to increase the compensated price to address the larger gap and clear the surplus.This means that the accounting system that measures all of this must be absolutely accurate and complete.  Douglas envisioned this being administered by the National Credit Office – a government agency.  But this means we need to trust the people who work there.  We can do better than that in the 21st century.

A new system like this will change the labor picture and consumption patterns significantly.  Who wants to work a boring job with the government when I have a dividend that gives me the flexibility to be more selective about what I chose to pour my labor into?  I can work the job I want – not the job I must.Who wants to do menial labor?  It sounds to me like we are going to need to use technology to meet these needs and indeed, that technology exists.  If I need to pay a cleaning lady $100/hour to clean my house, that is a business opportunity, and someone will invent a robot to do it instead.No more make-work projects just to provide a useless job.If we are going to fill the gap, then the money must actually exist in the economy to build quality products and eliminate the need for planned obsolescence. We need stop filling our landfills with junk that is the product of planned obsolescence and cheap goods.  We need to only create packaging that is biodegradable.  Businesses that pollute will not be tolerated and will lose their competitive edge because they will be forced to clean up their own mess.  Everyone will be able to pursue their highest goals.  Painters will paint.  Musicians will make music.  Adventure seekers will climb mountains, scuba dive, travel and explore.  Inventors will invent.  Businessmen will create great products and profit from their ventures.  Scientists will make our world a better place.  Builders will build.  Farmers will farm.  The rest of us who are excited by these super achievers will tag along for the ride, help them and prosper accordingly.  It will be like Star Trek!And what happens if nobody works?  There will be no dividend.  There will be no sales credit.  There will be nothing to buy!

This is the 21stcentury and we have… technology!  We have blockchain to produce immutable and incorruptible ledgers.  We have networks to tie all the transaction processing systems together.  We have open-source Git that can house the software that can implement our systems and we have an army of people capable of designing and building that software to verify that the systems running are the same code as housed in Git.  No fraud.  No means of corruption.  No desperate need or poverty that will inspire criminal behavior.  Everyone has what they need.  Everyone has the opportunity to pursue their dreams.  Will we have a perfect world?  Of course not.  But we will certainly have a better world.

All that remains is to describe that system and identify the use cases for it.  Let’s start with the use cases.

First, we define the actors.  The actors are basically the blockchain network and computers the software runs on, the businesses that produce our goods and services, and the consumers who buy those goods and services.

The fundamental use cases are:

Let us examine a proposed framework that can meet all of these goals using technology that already exists.

There will be a cryptocurrency that will be universally accepted by both participant merchants and consumers who wish to purchase their goods and services.Only those who formally participate and embrace this cryptocurrency can benefit from it.  The incentives to the consuming public to use it are as follows:

There must be a blockchain network whose sole purpose is to gather reports of A + B costs in summary from each business that wishes to participate in the new economy.  These statistics will be gathered within a given quarter and the results being reported will be from the previous quarter.  Every business that wishes to hold an account with a bank that takes the cryptocurrency deposits must be in good standing by having reported statistics for all previous reporting periods.  Failure to do so will block their access to credit."
2024-04-01 20:00:00,"Leaked Cell Phone Location Data Reveals 200 Mystery Guests On Epstein's ""Pedo Island""",https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/leaked-cell-phone-location-data-reveals-200-mystery-guests-epsteins-pedo-island#comment-stream,"Data from nearly200 mobile devicesreveal the exact path taken by visitors to Jeffrey Epstein's notorious 'pedo island,' which was tracked to80 cities around the worldspanning 26 states or territories.

The data, obtained byWired, came from recently bankrupt company Near Intelligence, which allegedly traced the phones which went to and from Little Saint James island, where Epstein allegedly ran an underage sex trafficking network.

Near Intelligence, which rebranded itself Azira amid an internal fraud scandal and other controversies, mapped out more than 11,000 coordinates from 166 locations. Some of the locations point togated communities in Michigan, Florida, as well as homes in Martha's Vineyard and Nantuckettand a nightclub in Miami, according to the report.

The coordinates that Near Intelligence collected and left exposed online pinpoint locations to within a few centimeters of space.Visitors were tracked as they moved from the Ritz-Carlton on neighboring St. Thomas Island, for instance, to a specific dock at the American Yacht Harbor—a marina once co-owned by Epstein that hosts an “impressive array” of pleasure boats and mega-yachts. The data pinpointed their movements as they were transported to Epstein’s dock on Little St. James,revealing the exact routes taken to the island.-Wired

The tracking data, which dates back as early asJuly 2016, also includes routes takeninside Epstein's 'waterfront temple' to toe beaches, pools and cabanaslocated on the 71-acre island. The surveillance data ends on July 6, 2019 -the day Epstein was arrested(for the second time).

Of course, the report excludes ""any precise location data that could be used to identify properties or individuals, to protect the privacy of anyone uninvolved in Epstein’s crimes,"" howeverWiredsuggests they document ""the numerous trips of wealthy and influential individuals seemingly undeterred by Epstein’sstatus as a convicted sex offender.""

The dataalsotracks people to Epstein's8,000-acre New Mexico ranchas well as his waterfront mansion on El Brillo Way in Palm Beach, where Epstein was accused of trafficking and sexually abusing numerous ""minor girls"" as part of his scheme.

AsWiredalso reports, ""Near’s data is notably missing any locations in Europe, where citizens are safeguarded by comprehensive privacy laws.""

Several ad exchanges,according to The Wall Street Journal, have reportedly terminated arrangements with Near, claiming that its use of their data violated the exchanges’ terms of service.

Officially, this data is intended to be used by companies hoping to determine where potential customers work and reside.But in October 2023, the Journal revealed that Near had once provided data to the US military via a maze of obscure marketing companies, cutouts, and conduits to defense contractors. Bankruptcy records reviewed by WIRED show that in April 2023, Near Intelligence signed a yearlong contract with another firm called nContext, a subsidiary of the defense contractor Sierra Nevada. -Wired

""The pervasive surveillance machine that has been developed for digital advertisingnow enables other uses completely unrelated to marketing, including government mass surveillance,"" according to Vienna-based researcher Wolfie Christl of Cracked Labs.

The disgraced financier was mysteriously found dead in his prison cell while awaiting trial for sexually abusing and trafficking young women and girls for yearsalong with his partner in crime, Ghislaine Maxwell.

Near Intelligencefiled for bankruptcy in December amid liabilities of around $100 million, less than 12 months after being listed by Nasdaq. An independent investigation commissioned by the board concluded thatmultiple executives engaged in a years-long ""concealed scheme""by which they allegedly cheated the company out of tens of millions of dollars. One of said executives has filed a claim against the company alleging defamation.

Since the BK was filed, the company 'quietly resumed operations,' rebranding itself as newly incorporated Azira.

A post shared by WIRED (@wired)

In February,Sen. Ron Wyden(D-OR) urged federal regulators to investigate Near Intelligence over allegations by theWall Street Journalthat its data had been used by a third-party to geofence ""sensitive locations,"" which included roughly 600 reproductive clinics at the behest of a conservative group.

2024-04-01 22:20:00,Top Journalism School Mandating Diversity Course To Earn Degree,https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/top-journalism-school-mandating-diversity-course-earn-degree,"Authored by Alice Giordano via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Mandatory wokeness has crept into one of the top journalism schools in the United States.

The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication is requiring students to complete the course Diversity and Civility at Cronkite (DCC) in order to earn their bachelor’s degree in journalism.

The course, which also applies to students studying sports journalism and digital media, redefines such traditional phrases as “America is a melting pot” as race-based microaggressions and teaches future journalists to avoid assuming “unearned benefits” that come with “heterosexual privileges.”

Examples of outdated heterosexual privileges given in the curriculum includeexcluding biological males who identified as female from traditional sex-segregated places like women’s locker rooms and women’s prisons.

“To object to a man using a women’s bathroom is an example of discrimination against transgender individuals,” reads a chapter in the course entitled “Sexuality and Gender Identity.”

Also part of the seven-unit course is required reading material entitled“A Guide to Gender Identity Terms.”

It includes lessons that emphasize the importance of asking someone for their preferred pronouns and using them.

“You should offer your own pronouns first and then ask for the other person’s pronouns,” the reading material states. “While it can be awkward at first, it can quickly become routine.”

The course also teaches students to view statements like “I believe the most qualified person should get the job,” as a microaggression that translates into “People of color are given extra unfair benefits because of their race,” and “Everyone can succeed in this society, if they work hard enough,” as implying that “People of color are lazy and/or incompetent and need to work harder.”

In response to inquiries from The Epoch Times, the state-run college described the mandatory course as “an entry-level course intended to bring thoughtful, open-minded discourse to issues of race, gender, sexual orientation, ability, income, geography and other aspects of personal identities.”

“The goal of the course is to help students appreciate people’s differences and to channel disagreements toward civil discussion,” the college said in a statement. “With that view, students should be better able to approach reporting and communications projects with a multicultural perspective and inspire mutual respect among students from various backgrounds and beliefs while at the university, and beyond.”

A spokesperson for the Walter Cronkite School, which is part of Arizona State University (ASU) also told The Epoch Times that students may opt out of specific discussions by sending their professor a private email requesting to do so.

Timothy Minella, Senior Constitutionalism Fellow at the Goldwater Institute’s Van Sittert Center for Constitutional Advocacy told The Epoch Times that the required journalism course is especially disturbing because it is being mandated by a public, taxpayer funded college.

“Students who decide to major in these subjects are not necessarily signing up to be progressive activists,” he said. “A public university that should be serving the entire public, not just the liberal slice of it, needs to return to its core mission of education, not indoctrination.”

Mr. Minella, who recently wrote a criticalanalysisof the course after obtaining student assignments and teacher syllabuses through a public records request, said he was especially shocked by an assignment for students contemplating a career in public relations.

The assignment, as shown byrecordsobtained by Mr. Minella, was based on an NPR interview with Demi Lovato, a pop star who has changed her gender identity multiple times.

It asks students: “Imagine you’re working at a PR firm and you have a client whose first album is about to drop. Your client’s gender identity is nonbinary and they use they/them pronouns.They have a massive press tour planned. How do you prepare journalists to talk with your client?”

Mr. Minella said the designers of the course “seemingly attempted to include every aspect of leftist identity politics” they could think up.

The growing controversy of state colleges pushing transgender and critical race theory has become widespread.

On March 2, in a 84 to 30 vote, the South Carolina House approved a bill to ban mandatory diversity training for both students and staff at state universities.

The bill also bans any diversity mission statements as part of their admissions and employment process.If passed, it would add South Carolina to 22 states that passed similar legislation.

The issue also rages on in secondary public schools across the United States.

Earlier this week, two civil rights lawyers filed a federallawsuiton behalf of a group made up of a Little Rock  high school teacher, students and their parents against Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and state Education Secretary Jacob Olivia, over the state’sLEARNS Act. LEARNS stands for Literacy, Empowerment, Accountability, Readiness, Networking, and School Safety.

It bans the teaching of CRT and gender ideology in public schools. The group claims the law violates their Constitutional rights to free speech.

In other recent legal action on the issue, the conservative legal group Liberty Counsel (LC) won its battle with the Osseo Area School District in Minnesota for mandating a course for high schoolers entitled “LGBTQIA+ History and Culture Lesson.”

In a March 28emailto LC, the school district wrote that “teacher opt-out religious accommodations will be approved” and “students may choose to leave prior to or during the lesson.”

Mr. Minella said diversity is being pushed to extremes in schools. By his calculations, he found that in the school year 2023, more than 400 students at the Walter Cronkite school, spent more than 2,000 hours of class time learning about diversity, equity, and inclusion.

According to Mr. Minella,there are at least 100 classes offered at the journalism school that includes “diversity,” “equity,” and “inclusion,” in its core curriculum.

In addition to the report on the DCC course at the Walter Cronkite School, The Goldwater Institute recently filed a lawsuit against ASU on behalf of two professors who were allegedly threatened with disciplinary charges for refusing to participate in the college’s diversity training.

In response to inquiries by the Epoch Times about the lawsuit,  an ASU spokesperson said in an email that “universities are” and that the school is “reserving comment until the board is fully briefed at its next board meeting.”

Its journalism school is named after legendary news anchor Walter Cronkite, dubbed the “most trusted man in America” by a public opinion survey conducted in 1972.

In a 1973interviewfor Playboy Magazine, Mr. Conkrite, who died in 2009, said that“being a liberal, in the true sense, is being nondoctrinaire, nondogmatic, non-committed to a cause—but examining each case on its merits.”

He also said in the interview that “most newspapermen by definition have to be liberal; if they’re not liberal, by my definition of it, then they can hardly be good newspapermen.

“If they’re preordained dogmatists for a cause, then they can’t be very good journalists; that is, if they carry it into their journalism.”

Not everyone agreed he was the most trusted man in America, including Arizona Republican and one-time presidential nominee Sen. Barry Goldwater—the namesake of The Goldwater Institute.

Mr. Cronkite was often accused by conservatives back then of taking cheap shots at Mr. Goldwater, known as the “Grand Old Man of The Republican Party.”

On the day of President John. F Kennedy’s funeral, the CBS newsmanreportedthat Mr. Goldwater was giving a political speech in Indiana instead of attending the President’s funeral when the U.S. Senator was actually in the state to attend his mother-in-law’s funeral.

The five-term Senator died in 1998.

2024-04-01 23:00:00,America’s Controversial Stealth Fighter Jet Can Now Carry Nukes,https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/americas-controversial-stealth-fighter-jet-can-now-carry-nukes,"Authored by John Haughey via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

It was a routine Pentagon announcement during a regular briefing the Friday before the president typically submits his annual defense budget request to Congress on the second Monday in March.

As of October, a spokesman for the Department of Defense’s (DOD) F-35 Joint Program Office told Pentagon beat writers, that “certain” Air Force F-35As have been operationally certified to carry the B61-12 thermonuclear gravity bomb.

While the revelation hasn’t drawn much interest from general news media in the United States, it has spurred extensive commentary within the defense-tech industry. And it is echoing loudly in Europe, most certainly within the Kremlin where Russian President Vladimir Putin has been openly discussing the use of tactical nuclear weapons.

The F-35A nuclear certification and introduction of the B61-12 bomb are key components in a tactical nuclear weapons upgrade in Europe by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in response to Russian saber-rattling—and advances—in battlefield nuclear weapons.

While NATO’s U.S.-built F-16A/Bs and F-16C/Ds and United Kingdom-built PA-200 Tornadoes are also fighter jets authorized to carry nuclear weapons,the F-35A Lightning II is now the first “fifth-generation” stealth fighter to be “dual-capable” of carrying conventional and nuclear weapons, according to the Pentagon.

The F-35A will soon be among NATO’s primary attack-strike jets. Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey are all stocking their air forces with F-35s, with Germany explicitly doing so because it would be nuclear-capable.

The March 8 announcement also confirmed the full-scale production of the B61-12 bomb. Their predecessors were housed in Belgium, Germany, Italy, and Turkey. According to some reports, they’ve been replacing them with new bombs since December 2022.

October’s nuclear certification was two months earlier than the January 2024 deadline the Pentagon set. Although only publicly acknowledged by the United States on March 8, Dutch military officials wrote in a November X post that their F-35As had achieved “initial certification” to carry nuclear weapons.

Since Pentagon policy prohibits the release of information about NATO partner military capacities, the announcement only addressed “certain” U.S. Air Force F-35As in Europe, with the U.S. fighter wing at Lakenheath in the United Kingdom likely among those upgrading.

“A lot of this is just information warfare, SOP [standard operating procedure] and optics that we got F-35As and allies who have F-35As in Europe,” retired Army Col. John Mills told The Epoch Times.

Mr. Mills, a 33-year Army veteran and former Director for Cybersecurity Policy, Strategy, and International Affairs under the Secretary of Defense, said the F-35A “has always been about Europe.”

“The message is that the F-35s are now there, and they are nuclear certified, and B61-12s are in storage ready to go, ready to be used, if necessary, out of Lakenheath,” he said.

Mr. Mills, who has spoken and written extensively on military matters, including about the F-35A in acolumnin The Epoch Times, said the announcement was aimed squarely at Mr. Putin.

“Of course,” he said. “He’s the target.”

“If anything, it does create a little bit of angst on the part of the Russians, because that means the [F-35-As] have more potential platforms, more different areas, more places for the Russians to keep track of,” said Mike Fredenburg, founding president of the Adam Smith Institute of San Diego. He writes frequently on defense tech for a wide range of publications, including National Review andThe Epoch Times.

“The F-35 has pretty good range for a single-engine fighter. It is stealth, and so you could obviously get closer to Russian air space before being effectively targeted than you could, let’s say, with an F-15,” noting that with 600 to 700 F-35s in U.S. and allied air forces, “we have hundreds of them, and at any given time, some of them are probably capable of flying.”

Mr. Fredenburg admits:“I’m not a huge fan of the F-35.”

So little so that for those who have followed the aircraft’s checkered development for the past 30 years, he had to quantify how truly significant the F-35A certification is. “I don’t want to say it’s insignificant. It does, I think, potentially create some more instability because nobody else has many stealth fighters,” Mr. Fredenburg told The Epoch Times.

“I’d say it'd be more significant if you were putting [a nuclear weapon] on a platform that was more reliable, that you could count on. I guess I could say that.”

“First of all,” Mr. Fredenburg said, “you have to look at the history. From the very beginning, it was doomed. It was too heavy. There’s no way you can make an engine powerful enough to fly a plane that big. The plane is the largest single-engine plane in the world.”

When first envisioned in the early 1990s, the F-35 was touted by Lockheed Martin as an all-purpose, next-generation stealth joint-force single-engine fighter that would replace up to 16 different types of warcraft, including the Navy’s F-14, the Air Force’s F-16, and the Marine Corps’ Harrier jump jets.

That was nearly two generations ago.

Design began in 1994. After a series of delays, dozens of F-35-equipped squadrons were supposed to be operational at a cost of $233 billion by 2010.

“It didn’t even come close to that,” Mr. Mills said.

By 2016, the project’s cost had doubled. It remains more than a decade behind schedule and billions over budget with mixed results, some say.

“What they did is, you know how you ‘soup up’ your car? Put nitrate in it or something like that? Mr. Fredenburg said. “You might be able to get it around a few times before it blows up, but that’s what they did here.

“They ‘souped up’ the F-22 engine and made it super, super hot to get the horsepower, that thrust, and there’s no way that engine was going to be durable.

“So,” he continued, “it’s got an engine that can’t do the job. It won’t be reliable ever. Ever.”

2024-04-01 23:40:00,"Blaming Russia For ""Havana Syndrome"" Pushes The Opposite Narrative Than Intended",https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/blaming-russia-havana-syndrome-pushes-opposite-narrative-intended,"Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

For Russia to have successfully used a mobile directed energy weapon over 1,500 times, including against the US’ “top 5%, 10% performing officers across the Defense Intelligence Agency,” then it must have deeply penetrated the US Government in order to discover those elite targets’ identities and locations.

CBS News, The Insider, and Der Spiegelreleased the findings of their joint investigationon Sundayblaming Russia for “Havana Syndrome”, which refers to the mysterious ear and head painthatover 1,500 US Government (USG) staffers across the world claim to have experiencedsince 2016. It appeared timed to coincide withCongress’ plans to vote on Ukraine aidsometime later this month, with the intent obviously being toscare lawmakers into approving more funds for America’sproxywaron Russia.

It might have the opposite effect than intended, however, since those outlets’ dramatic claims paint a picture of deep Russian intelligence penetration of the US’ diplomatic and security services that can’t be remedied by simply sending more money to Ukraine. If what they wrote is true, then Russia has created a mobile directed energy weapon (DEW) that it’s already successfully used over 1,500 times, including against the US’ “top 5%, 10% performing officers across the Defense Intelligence Agency”.

This startling statistic comes from the recently retired Army lieutenant colonel who ran the Pentagon’s investigation into the matter.He claimed that this elite echelon of victims had all “worked against Russia, focused on Russia, and done extremely well” but were then “neutralized” after their injuries. His allegations contradict the Intelligence Community’s (IC)official reviewfrom last year that no DEWs nor foreign adversaries were responsible for these “anomalous health incidents”.

Those who take the IC’s official review at face value suspect that the prior hysteria about “Havana syndrome” was just a means of fearmongering about Russia, which they also naturally believe is the motive behind the latest joint investigation’s findings. Meanwhile, those who suspected that the IC’s official review was a cover-up take the latest joint investigation’s findings at face value,which means that they truly believe that Russia has deeply penetrated the US’ diplomatic and security services.

There’s no credible evidence to suggest that this is the case, especially since Russia would have presumably been much better prepared for responding to America’s diplomatic and military provocations throughout the course of their ongoing proxy war if it had moles within both. Nevertheless, the only way that one can believe that it’s systematically targeting members of those institutions who had all worked against it “extremely well” in the past isif it knew who they were and where they lived.

That in turn obliges one to believe that it must have deeply penetrated them in order to obtain this highly classified information, thusmeaning that Russian spies are more highly placed than anyone had thoughteven after the witch hunt that followed the Russiagate hysteria. Once again, there’s no credible evidence that this is the case, and another argument against this theory is that Russia isn’t targeting any similarly prominent Ukrainian diplomats or security officialsdespite being at “war” with their country.

Russia may be behind the “Havana Syndrome” attacks against U.S. officials, investigation by 60 Minutes, Der Spiegel and The Insider claims.Havana Syndrome may have its origin in the use of directed energy weapons wielded by the Russian GRU’s infamous Unit 29155.pic.twitter.com/n7X0MIx1mw

Reflecting on the abovementioned insight, it’s much more likely that Russia has nothing to do with “Havana syndrome” and that the latest joint investigation’s findings are just a desperate attempt to scare lawmakers into approving more Ukraine aid ahead of their planned vote later this month. Any penetration of the IC at the level that this conspiracy theory implies would have led to the past two years unfolding in a very different way and Russianot being caught off guardby the proxy war that broke out.

2024-04-02 02:00:00,Turkey Expected To Become US' Largest Supplier Of Artillery,https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/turkey-expected-become-us-largest-supplier-artillery,"Authored by Ahmed Adel via GlobalResearch.ca,

Turkey is set to become the United States’ largest supplier of artillery shells as NATO allies have exhausted their stocks and now struggle to ship ammunition to Ukraine.Turkey’s indirect support for Ukraine is also supplemented by direct support, such as producing drones and warships, yet TurkishPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoganoffers himself as a viable partner in searching for peace between Ukraine and Russia.

“Turkish supplies of trinitrotoluene, known as TNT, and nitroguanidine, which is used as a propellant, would be crucial in the production of Nato-standard 155mm calibre ammunition — potentially tripling production, according to officials familiar with the discussions,”a Bloomberg report said, adding: “Turkey is already on track to becoming the biggest seller of the artillery shells to the US as early as this year.”

The surge in demand has delayed global orders and has put pressure on defence supply chains, especially for components such as TNT.  According to the outlet, to help alleviate this issue, Turkish defence company Repkon’s production lines are expected to produce about 30% of all US-made 155mm artillery shells by 2025.

The Pentagon said in a statement about investment in Texas’ defence industry with Turkish counterparts that working with allies “is key to building a global defence industrial base.”

Additionally, Washington purchased 116,000 rounds of battle-ready ammunition from Turkish company Arca Defense, with delivery expected later this year and further purchases believed to be concluding soon to be ready for delivery in 2025.

As Bloomberg admitted,

“The US and European efforts are part of a race to catch up with Moscow,whose war machine has put it in a position to produce or procure – according to some estimates – 4 million rounds this year, including shipments from North Korea. By contrast, the European Union expects to triple its production of artillery shells this year to around 1.4 million units.”

It is unsurprising that Turkey has been awarded a lucrative contract, given the recent announcement that Erdogan will visit the White House on May 9, the first time since USPresident Joe Bidentook office.

The agreement with Ankara also reveals a delicate balance between the NATO allies, whose relations have been strained by the Russian military operation in Ukraine and Turkey’s months-long block on Sweden’s membership in the Atlantic Alliance. However, with Turkey greenlighting Sweden’s accession and plans to contribute to Ukraine’s military-industrial complex, the country is now being rewarded with export contracts and approval to upgrade its aging F-16 fighter jet fleet.

The Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used by the Ukrainian military against Russian forces.The drone maker, Baykar, has initiated the construction of a factory in Ukraine, and the company’s CEO said in February that they aim to complete the project within approximately 12 months and produce around 120 units a year.

At the same time, it is recalled that in February, France, Greece, and Cyprus blocked financing for the supply of Bayraktar drones and artillery shells for Ukraine, which were to be purchased with European funds. Turkey was set to be financed from EU funds for some time, but once the order was confirmed, the three countries swiftly blocked the financing.

Although the initiative failed, the US recognised Turkey’s rapprochement with the West and is now rewarding the country with imports and exports in the defence sector.This is despite the fact that the issue of the acquisition of the Russian-made S-400 is not resolved, which is the reason Turkey was booted from the F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet program to begin with.

Erdogan announced his offer to host a peace summit between Ukraine and Russia earlier this month following a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpartVolodymyr Zelensky.

“Since the beginning, we have contributed as much as we could toward ending the war through negotiations,” Erdogan said.

“We are also ready to host a peace summit in which Russia will also be included.”

Although Erdogan claims to have contributed as much as possible to ending the war through negotiations, his country has also contributed to prolonging it.It is also recalled that during Zelensky’s visit to Turkey, he visited the shipyard where the two corvettes are being built for the Ukrainian Navy. At the same time, Turkey is providing drones to the Ukrainian military and is now replenishing the US’ artillery stocks. This is even though Ukraine has no chance of winning the war, meaning Turkey is not an honest broker for peace.

2024-04-02 02:45:00,"Chinese EV Makers Scramble To Offer Incentives To Compete With Tesla And ""Disruptive"" Xiaomi",https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/chinese-ev-makers-scramble-offer-incentives-compete-tesla-and-disruptive-xiaomi,"The competition in China's EV world continues to heat up, as the market becomes more and more saturated.

The country's automakers are aggressively trying to take advantage of Tesla's recent price hikes by offering incentives, while at the same time gearing up to compete with the ""disruptive"" entry of Xiaomi into the market,Bloomberg reported this week.

The report notes that on April 1, Shanghai-based Nio unveiled an incentive plan worth up to 1 billion yuan ($186.4 million) to encourage gasoline vehicle owners to switch, offering perks like battery swaps, extra driving function subscriptions, and a Nio smartphone.

At the same time, Xpeng reduced prices on certain vehicles by up to 20,000 yuan, and Chery Automobile introduced free purchase tax on select models and improved trade-in values.

The heavy promotions stand at odds with Tesla's strategy in China, which saw the automaker increase its Model Y SUV price, a move previously hinted to boost pre-hike demand and sales.

However, despite anticipation of the price rise, Tesla had to cut production at its Shanghai facility due to falling shipments in early 2024, highlighting the fierce competition in China's vast car market.

Xiaomi has now also entered the competitive EV market, announcing its new SU7 model's pricing and beginning to accept orders last week. The launch was met with enthusiasm, garnering over 88,898 pre-orders within the first 24 hours, as reported on Xiaomi's social media.

Recall we wrote just days ago that Nissan is the latest manufacturer to aim to cut EV costs in order to keep up with an increasingly competitive and saturated landscape. The company is now seeking to compete with Chinese rivals by slashing costs by 30%,Financial Times reportedlast weekend.

Similarly, we have noted that auto companies are slashing investment in EVs, as is the case with American auto manufacturers like Ford and GM. Wewrote last monththat Joe Biden's vision for EVs across America is in ""full collapse"".

As we wrote then: ""Meanwhile, the higher costs are driving automakers away from EVs. And as battery material requirements are set to double by 2027, fulfilling these mandates will be increasingly difficult, putting Biden's ambitious EV strategy at risk.""

At least for now, however, it looks like Tesla and BYD will continue to lead the charge and, likely, command the pricing power that goes with it in China.

2024-04-02 04:15:00,Where Trust In The News Is Highest & Lowest,https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/where-trust-news-highest-lowest#comment-stream,"Each year, the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism publishes areporton digital news consumption.

The latest edition, based on surveys of more than 93,000 people in 46 countries, documents howoverall trust in news has slid downwards by two percentage points in the past year.About four in ten people in the total sample say they trust most news most of the time. Among the countries surveyed,Finlandremains the country with the highest level of trust (69 percent), while Greece (19 percent) has the lowest.

The share of citizens in all countries surveyed who are “very” or “extremely” interested in news and consume it regularly fell from 51 percent in 2022 to 48 percent in 2023. Many people are choosing to increasingly ration or limit their exposure to news, or at least to news of a certain kind. News that is overly repetitive or deemed ""emotionally draining"" is often passed over in favor of something more uplifting.

As Statista's Anna Fleck reports,according to the report, with the abundance of channels now available,""it is not surprising that news consumers are increasingly feeling overwhelmed and confused, and many are turning away temporarily or permanently. Selective news avoidance and news fatigue have been exacerbated by the challenging times we live in.""

As the study reveals,social networks that rely more on videos such as TikTok, Instagram or YouTube are becoming increasingly important for news.

You will find more infographics atStatista

In this respect the writers add:""it is clear thatmost consumers are not looking for more news, but for the news that seems most relevant to them and helps them make sense of the complex issues we face. The new technological disruption of artificial intelligence is just around the corner, threatening to unleash a new wave of personalized, but potentially unreliable, content.""

It is important to note here that this data is based on citizens’ perceptions of the trustworthiness of media or news brands and that these scores are aggregates of subjective opinions.Analysts stress that this means that changes over time are often much influenced by “political and social factors as with the news itself.""

2024-04-02 05:00:00,Poland Prepares New Hate-Speech Law: 3 Years In Prison For Insulting LGBT People,https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/poland-prepares-new-hate-speech-law-3-years-prison-insulting-lgbt-people#comment-stream,"Poland, once a bastion of conservatism, is radically shifting gears under the new left-liberal government with a new “hate speech” law that could see offenders imprisoned for up to three years for “offensive” content against LGBT people.

The left had already been pushing for stricter speech controls before the coalition government formed, and since it won power, theleft is now making good on its promises. On Wednesday, the Polish Ministry of Justice published a draft amendment to the penal code regarding hate speech on the website of the Government Legislation Center.

The new draft law is looking to expand classifications regarding hate speech to include age, disability, gender, sexual orientation and gender identity, according to Polish news outletDoRzeczy.

In a strong stand against government plans to penalize what it calls ""hate speech,"" Poland's Confederation party asserts the need for free and unrestricted public discourse

“The introduction of the proposed solutions will ensure enhanced and full criminal law protection against the use of violence or unlawful threats, incitement to hatred, insults and violations of bodily integrity due to the disability, age, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity of the injured party,” reads the draft.

The draft also threatens up to five years in prison for “threats.”

However, even for “insults,” which are loosely defined, penalties could be extremely harsh under the new draft law.

Provisions regarding gender, sexual orientation and gender identity have been added to article 256, which covers incitement to hated and in article 257 regarding insults.

Now, under these new rules, “insults” against sexual orientation or gender identity will be punishable by up to three years in prison.

Opposition parties in Poland were alreadywarning against proposals to change hate speech lawsin January of this year when the new government first came to power. They argued that such changes would effectively end free speech in Poland and represent a grave threat to religious freedom, with Catholicism in particular critical of many aspects of LGBT.

“The ruling coalition, as part of its coalition agreement, has announced that they want to penalize so-calledhate speech. The current left-wing Deputy Minister of JusticeKrzysztof Śmiszek, from the New Left, has stated that his department is currently working on introducing these regulations, which limit freedom of speech and public debate in Poland.We, as the Confederation, strongly oppose this. The direct consequence of criminalizing certain words will, in fact, be the criminalization of conservative, religious, Christian views,” said Confederation MP Karina Bosak on Friday.

Dobromir Sośnierz, another party member, highlighted concerns about the subjective nature of defining hate speech.

“What the left understands by so-called hate speech, in practice, will mean speech hated by Minister Śmiszek, not necessarily speech that expresses hatred towards someone, but something that leftists dislike,”he remarked.

2024-04-02 05:45:00,These Are The Most Dangerous Countries In The World,https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/these-are-most-dangerous-countries-world#comment-stream,"Several of the most dangerous countries in the world fall within a small radius in the Caribbean, a longstanding hotbed for organized crime.

These countries have homicide rates that are more thanfourfoldthe rate of America, which stands at 6.4 per 100,000 people. Going further, the vast majority of killings are driven by criminal activity using illegal guns that are often smuggled in from the United States.

This graphic,via Visual Capitalist's Niccolo Conte,shows the countries with the highest murder rates, based on data fromUNODC.

Here are the countries with the most killings per 100,000 people as of 2022:

Data for St. Kitts and Nevis as of 2021. Data for South Africa as of 2020.

With a murder rate that is almost 10 times higher than the global average,Jamaicaranks first.

In January alone, there were 65 killings across the country, leading the State Department to heighten travel warnings for Americans. Not only that, homicides are even becoming more common in all-inclusive resorts. Often, police action is lackluster in response to the ongoing deadly incidents, and prosecution is slow.

Along with Jamaica, island nationsTrinidad and Tobagoand theBahamasfall on this list.

Ranking sixth globally isSouth Africa, with a homicide rate of 34 per 100,000 people. Last year, 75 people on average were killed each day, while robberies averaged 400 daily. One part of the problem is that the country is known to have widespread criminal activity across mining, construction, and taxi industries. Another major factor is that the country serves as a transit hub forillicit drugsthat are transported from Afghanistan to Europe.

In South America,Ecuadorranks as the most dangerous country, driven by escalating gang violence. While the country had some of the lowest homicide rates in the region in 2019, drug gangs have increasingly gripped the country.

In January, gang members stormed a news station, detonated bombs through the streets, and kidnapped policemen when the president issued a state of emergency after a notorious cartel leader escaped from prison. More recently, an Ecuadoran mayor was found dead amid the country’s third month in emergency lockdowns.

2024-04-02 06:30:00,"Trump Posts $175 Million, Preventing Seizure Of Buildings In Civil Fraud Case As NY 'Hush Money' Case Judge Expands Gag Order",https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/trump-posts-175-million-preventing-seizure-buildings-civil-fraud-case-ny-hush-money-case,"Authored by Catherine Yang via The Epoch Times,

Former President Donald Trump has posted $175 million in his New York civil fraud case, meeting the 10-day deadline given on March 25 and staying execution of judgment in the case.

The payment prevents any seizure of President Trump’s assets as his appeal of the case is heard.

“As promised, President Trump has posted bond. He looks forward to vindicating his rights on appeal and overturning this unjust verdict,”the president’s attorney Alina Habba said in a statement.

New York Attorney General Letitia James sued the 45th president in 2022, accusing him of inflating his net worth and defrauding insurers and banks, and therefore the public, in Trump Organization annual statements of financial condition.

Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg and comptroller Jeffrey McConney, and several Trump Organization holding companies were named codefendants in the case presided over by New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron in a three-month bench trial.

The judge ultimately ordered $363 million disgorgement with 9 percent backdated interest, totaling $464 million, with the lion’s share to be paid by President Trump; as well as prohibiting the defendants from holding director positions in any business or legal entity in New York for a period of time, and a minimum three-year monitorship of Trump Organization after which there may be additional penalties.

The posting of the judgment amount was not required in order for President Trump to appeal the case, but had been a requirement to stay enforcement of the judgment in the meantime.

“I’ll fight this all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary,”President Trump told Fox News days before the deadline.“They can’t take away your property before you’ve had a chance to appeal the decision of a Trump-hating, incompetent judge who has been overturned more than any judge in the state.”

Days before President Trump posted bond, he said on social media that he had nearly $500 million in cash but intended to use much of it on his presidential campaign. He accused his political opponents of trying to make him spend that cash fund on legal battles rather than on his campaign for president.

State law would have required President Trump to post the full judgment amount within 30 days in order to stay the execution of judgment, but the appellate courtloweredthe $454 million requirement to $175 million on the last day of the deadline. It gave him a 10-day window to post the new amount, and did not comment on the underlying reasons for the change.

President Trump said the appellate division’s ruling was further evidence that the original bond requirement was unreasonable.

“This is a confrontation between a Judge and those that rule above him - A very bad situation in which to place New York State and the Rule of Law!”President Trump stated of the appellate decision.“This is the 5th time in this case that he has been overturned, a record. His credibility, and that of Letitia James, has been shattered.”

Justice Engoron, who presided over the bench trial and issued the massive disgorgement figure. The attorney general had asked for $250 million in disgorgement before trial, and changed that number to $370 million near the end of the trial.

President Trump claimed in a press conference that the judge and attorney general had access to his finances because of the monitorship requirement, saw a figure close to $464 million cash, and decided that was what they were going to make him pay.He told reporters he did have the cash necessary to stay judgment, but wanted to use it to campaign and not satisfy who he described as “crooked” officials.

Putting all his cash into an escrow account where neither he nor the state could touch it for the duration of the appeal was one option to stay judgment.

A bond was another, and would not have required President Trump to move his cash reserves, but would have required him to have higher amounts of cash to serve as collateral—$577 million, by his attorneys’ estimates, after negotiations with 30-plus surety companies fell through.

For weeks, defense attorneys argued in the appellate division that securing a $464 million bond was “impossible.” Surety companies just don’t issue bonds that big, they argued.

A second problem was that for them to consider doing so they would have needed 120 percent in cash as collateral plus a high premium or two. This came out to be far more cash than Trump Organization had, as a real estate company.

Attorneys revealed that the only company even willing to consider real estate, or any hard asset, as collateral was Chubb, but after hours of negotiation into the last days of the deadline the company decided it could not accept real estate. After this negotiation failed, the lawyers attached a sworn affidavit from one of the four brokers who had been working on this for the defense to provide more context.

In the bond world, $100 million is large, he said. Only a handful of sureties are even authorized by the federal government to issue higher amounts. But most still have internal policies limiting bonds to $100 million, and when they do issue larger bonds it is only for big publicly traded conglomerates.

To underscore that fact, the attorney general had also listed several cases where bonds larger than President Trump’s were fully bonded on appeal, but they all involved large companies with billions in annual revenue, like Samsung and Apple.

The judge overseeing the Manhattan district attorney’s “hush money” case against former President Donald Trump has approved a request to expand a recently imposed gag order on the president.

The decision came late Monday and gags President Trump from public discussion of family members of the court, the family members of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and all others named in the order, including jurors, potential jurors, witnesses, court staff, counsel, and their families.

The order does not bar comments about the judge himself or Mr. Bragg, an elected Democrat.

“This pattern of attacking family members of presiding jurists and attorneys assigned to his cases serves no legitimate purpose,” New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan wrote in his 5-pageruling. “It merely injects fear in those assigned or called to participate in the proceedings that not only they, but their family members as well, are ‘fair game,’ for Defendant’s vitriol.”

While the judge noted that courts are “understandably concerned” about limiting defendants’ freedom of speech, particularly for public figures,“The circumstances of the instant matter, however, are different,” he wrote. “The conventional ‘David vs. Goliath’ roles are no longer in play as demonstrated by the singular power defendant’s words have on countless others.”

He cited in his ruling arguments from the prosecution that “multiple potential witnesses have already raised grave concerns [...] about their own safety and that of their family members should they appear as witnesses against the defendant.” The judge wrote that those fears “undoubtedly interfere” with the proceedings.

“The average observer, must now, after hearing defendant’s recent attacks, draw the conclusion that if they become involved in these proceedings, even tangentially, they should worry not only for themselves, but for their loved ones as well,” he added.

Mr. Bragg had petitioned Justice Merchan earlier in the day to expand thegag orderto prevent President Trump from referencing family members of individuals involved in the case. The attorney general’s office highlighted comments from President Trump referencing the judge’s daughter as evidence of why the order was needed.

“Defendant’s dangerous, violent, and reprehensible rhetoric fundamentally threatens the integrity of these proceedings and is intended to intimidate witnesses and trial participants alike—including this Court,”state prosecutor Matthew Colangelo wrote in the court filing.

President Trump had madepostsmentioning Justice Merchan’s daughter, Loren Merchan, who owns a Democrat political consulting firm. He did not refer to Ms. Merchan by name.

The former president wrote in one post,“Judge Juan Merchan, a very distinguished looking man, is nevertheless a true and certified Trump Hater who suffers from a very serious case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.

“In other words, he hates me! His daughter is a senior executive at a Super Liberal Democrat firm that works for Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, the Democrat National Committee, Senate Majority PAC, and even Crooked Joe Biden.”

In another, he said, “Maybe the Judge is such a hater because his daughter makes money by working to ‘Get Trump.’”

Critics responded by complaining that his posts were attacks on Ms. Merchan and false accusations.

President Trump’s attorneys hadpushed backagainst the request, saying that it would further violate the presumptive Republican nominee’s First Amendment rights. But Judge Merchan ultimately sided with the prosecution.

They are also continuing to seek therecusalof Justice Merchan, citing a conflict of interest, over his daughter’s business, which they say has profited heavily off the prosecution of their client.

Two major Democratic clients of Ms. Merchan raised at least $93 million in political donations in a campaign that mentioned President Trump’s case in their solicitation emails, according to The New York Post.

Justice Merchandeclinedto recuse himself from the case last August after the defense argued that he was biased for similar reasons, citing that his daughter headed a marketing agency that worked for Democrat candidates, including Vice President Kamala Harris.

The hush money trial is scheduled to start on April 15. It’s the first criminal trial involving the former president. He faces other cases in Washington, Florida, and Georgia.

President Trump faces 91 felony counts in all, and he has denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. He has said that the cases are politically motivated attempts to harm his 2024 presidential campaign.

2024-04-02 06:44:00,In Russia Mass Deportations Of Muslim Migrants Surge After Moscow Terror Attack,https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/russia-mass-deportations-muslim-migrants-surge-after-moscow-terror-attack,"There have been widespread reports ofmass deportations of Muslim migrants from Russiain the wake of the March 22 terror attack on the Crocus City Hall venue in a Moscow suburbwhich killedat least 140 people and left hundreds more wounded and injured.

This trend is said to be the result of a significant uptick inraids by authorities on apartments and dorm complexes known to house Central Asian migrants, amid concerns that Islamic radicals could carry out more attacks.

President Vladimir Putin has putblame on Islamic extremistsfor the major attack which involved four gunmen planting explosives and randomly shooting into crowds; however, he and Kremlin officials also believe the men hadassistance from Ukraine or possibly US or other foreign intelligence.

The alleged gunmen, who reportedly tried to escape across the Ukrainian border, areall Tajik nationals. A number of other foreigners have also been arrested in the days after the attack. Washington has said ISIS-K was behind it, while condemning Moscow's allegations that the US or Ukraine could have had something to do with it.

The regional pro-opposition outletMeduzahassaidthat in the last week of March, St. Petersburg courts ""received 584 cases of administrative offenses in connection with non-compliance with migration legislation.""

The report indicated thatat least 418 foreigners were then ordered to go to special holding facilities to await expulsionfrom the country. ""Another 48 people must pay a fine and leave the Russian Federation on their own,"" Meduza wrote.

In Russia, after the Crocus City Hall mass murder of 143 people by Tajik Muslims, the mass deportations have begun.The airport is jammed packed.pic.twitter.com/VRIlNFplXa

An organization of human right lawyers who work in Russia,Perviy Otdel,observedin a statement Friday that in the St. Petersburg region, ""Temporary detention centers for foreign citizens are packed, surrounded by special vehicles and buses heading to the airport.""

The Amsterdam-basedMoscow Timeslinked the surge in deportations to the Crocus City Hallterror attack:

The countries where the migrants were being sent to were not specified, though it is known that labor migrants in Russia mostly hail from poor Central Asian countries.

Bailiffs reportedly refer to St. Petersburg’s mass deportations as“Operation Anti-Migrant,”with raids targeting local hostels and apartments. Similar raids werereportedin Moscow and other Russian cities.

Anti-immigrant sentiment surged after four gunmen — who were later identified as Tajik nationals — stormed Crocus City Hall last Friday, killing 144 people and injuring 382 in the shooting and massive fire at the popular concert venue.

The backlash against Russia's sizeable Tajik immigrant community is expected to grow. Recent years have seen over one million unemployed Tajiks enter Russia in search of work.

🚨 Russia: Yesterday Vladimir Osechkin relayed info from FSB sources that an order for indiscriminate mass raids and repressions against Muslims came down in 'response' to the Crocus City Hall massacre. Today, the FSB made mass arrests at the Wildberries warehouse in Electrostal.pic.twitter.com/pjr5OkhECN

A separateMoscow Timesreport has found that ""Between 2012 and 2018, over 2,000 Tajik citizensjoinedterrorist groups in Syria and Iraq, making Tajikistan the third highest sender of foreign fighters to the war on a per capita basis.""

The report continues: ""Most joined Islamic State, with some taking up key positions, including the group’s War Minister Gulmurod Halimov, who used to serve as head of Tajikistan’s OMON paramilitary police force."" This means Russia's monitoring of and crackdown on this migrant community is likely only to grow from this point.

2024-04-02 07:20:00,"The Senate Calls Out-Of-Control Spending A National Security Threat, Keeps Spending Anyway...",https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/senate-calls-out-control-spending-national-security-threat-keeps-spending-anyway#comment-stream,"Authored by Ron Paul via The Ron Paul Institute,

Last month, the US Senate passed a resolution saying the over 34 trillion dollars (and growing) national debt threatens national security.

A few days later, a bipartisan majority of the Senate voted for a 1.2 trillion dollars spending bill. In addition to the usual increases in war and welfare spending,the bill funds gender transitioning for minors without parental consent and red flag laws, which allow law enforcement to seize an individual’s firearms without due process.

Before passage of the latest spending bill, the Congressional Budget Orifice (CBO) released a report predicting that the national debt would exceed the prior record of 106.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2028. Interest payments on the national debt are estimated to reach 870 billion dollars this year, more than the government will spend on the military. The CBO estimates that, unless Congress cuts spending (which is highly unlikely),by 2051 interest on the debt will exceed not just military spending but spending on the two biggest items in the federal budget — Social Security and Medicare.

As Eric Boehm of Reason magazine points out, the CBO report understates how much federal spending will grow in the next several decades since it cannot predict what “crises” future congresses and presidents will exploit to ramp up federal spending.

As Boehm suggests,someone projecting 30 years ago how much government would spend in the future would not have included the increase in spending due to 9/11, the subsequent creation of a homeland security-industrial complex, the “forever” wars in Afghanistan and Iraqi, the housing meltdown, or the covid lockdown.

The hypothetical budget projection would also not have predicted legislation like the Medicare prescription drug benefit or Obamacare.

The large and growing interest on the national debt puts pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low.The Federal Reserve’s rate increases, though relatively small, are one reason national debt payments rose by 32 percent since last year. The need for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low will further erode the dollar’s purchasing power, subjecting more Americans to the insidious inflation tax. It will eventually cause a loss of the dollar’s world reserve currency status.This will result in a major economic meltdown that will likely lead to widespread civil unrest, the further growth of authoritarian movements on both the left and right, and new restrictions on liberty.

The only way out of this is for Congress to begin winding down the welfare-warfare state.

A good place to start is by cutting spending on militarism and forgoing interventionism. Savings from these cuts could be used to ensure those dependent on entitlement and welfare programs are not harmed as Congress winds down these programs. Responsibility for providing support for the truly needy should be returned to local and religious charitable institutions, while responsibility for education should be returned to local communities and parents. Congress should also pass legislation requiring any new spending to be offset by cuts in other federal spending and forbidding the Federal Reserve from purchasing federal debt instruments.

These steps will be opposed by the special interests that benefit from the current system, but they are the only way to ensure the blessings of liberty and prosperity to our posterity.

2024-04-02 07:45:00,Calvin Klein Owner PVH Crashes On Sales Warning,https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/calvin-klein-owner-pvh-crashes-sales-warning#comment-stream,"PVH Corp., the owner of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands, is poised for one the largest intraday drops ever if premarket losses hold following the release of full-year sales guidance that missed Wall Street's expectations on Monday evening.

PVH's revenue was flat in the fourth quarter due to its souring performance in North America, and it warned about a decline in first-quarter sales. The company noted the ""challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, particularly impacting the wholesale business"" as one reason for the sales slowdown.

PVH expects first-quarter revenue to plunge 11% to $1.92 billion, missing Wall Street estimates. FactSet estimates had analysts around $2.09 billion. The company forecasted revenue declines of 6% to 7% to as much as $8.57 billion, while analysts anticipated $9.04 billion.

Here's a snapshot of the fourth quarter results (courtesy of Bloomberg):

Adjusted EPS $3.72 vs. $2.38 y/y, estimate $3.52 (Bloomberg Consensus)

Revenue $2.49 billion vs. $2.49 billion y/y, estimate $2.42 billion

Calvin Klein total revenue $1.06 billion, +4.3% y/y, estimate $1.04 billion

Calvin Klein North America revenue $360.0 million, -7.8% y/y, estimate $387.3 million

Calvin Klein international revenue $704.4 million, +12% y/y, estimate $640.9 million

Tommy Hilfiger total revenue $1.35 billion, +0.8% y/y, estimate $1.34 billion

Tommy Hilfiger North America revenue $400.6 million, +4.5% y/y, estimate $398.7 million

Tommy Hilfiger international revenue $950.6 million, -0.7% y/y, estimate $925 million

Gross margin 60.3% vs. 56.8% y/y, estimate 59.8%

Inventory -21.2%, estimate -20%

First quarter forecast:

And 2025 year forecast:

In a press release, Stefan Larsson, CEO, commented that ""macro has become more challenged"" and that ""our focus is on quality of sales to further strengthen our market-leading position.""

Zac Coughlin, CFO, also blamed a ""tougher macroeconomic backdrop"" on the sales slowdown.

PVH shares crashed as much as 24% in premarket trading in New York on the dismal earnings news and sour forecasts. If losses hold into the cash session, this would represent the largest intra-day losses ever for the company.

Here's what Wall Street analysts are saying about the earnings (courtesy of Bloomberg):

TD Cowen, John Kernan (buy)

Sales guidance for the year is ""well below"" Kernan's current model and the more muted buy-side expectations for a decline in the low single digits

Notes growth in North America and Asia-Pacific regions will be offset by a sizable decline in Europe

""Assuming Europe Wholesale is $2.6B of a $4.4B Europe base, the guidance could imply Europe wholesale down high-teens to 20% in FY24""

JPMorgan, Matthew Boss (overweight)

While PVH beat expectations in 4Q, the full-year guidance was ""set below consensus""

Flags commentary on declining growth in Europe, which Boss notes is primarily wholesale driven; also notes full-year outlook contemplates softer direct-to-consumer growth in the region

PT cut to $146 from $165

BMO Capital Markets, Simeon Siegel (market perform)

The top- and bottom-line beat in 4Q was ""impressive,"" though 1Q and full-year guidance were below consensus expectations

Revenue came ahead, with the international business leading the beat, driven by Asia-Pacific; however, macro continued to weigh on Europe

Evercore ISI, Michael Binetti (outperform)

Margin outlook for 2024 is significantly disappointing, though Binetti believes PVH is planning for positive growth in North America direct-to-consumer and wholesale

""PVH significantly backtracked on several of the inputs it gave just 90 days ago for 2024—largely due to worsening trends in Europe""

Blame it on the 'macro,' of course.

2024-04-02 09:45:00,"Baltimore Bridge Collapse: New Underwater 3D Images Show ""Sheer Magnitude"" Of Salvage Operation Ahead",https://web.archive.org/web/20240402115241/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/temporary-shipping-channel-reopens-near-baltimore-bridge-collapse-small-vessels#comment-stream,"Local, state, or federal officials have yet to offer a timeline for salvage crews to completely remove the collapsed bridge from the main shipping channel entering the Port of Baltimore.

On Tuesday morning, the Baltimore District, US Army Corps of Engineers published new 3D images of the wreckage at the bottom of the shipping channel on social media.

""These 3D images show the sheer magnitude of the very difficult and challenging salvage operation ahead,""the US Army Corps of Engineers said in a Facebook post.

The post continued, ""The underwater sonar imaging tool, known as CODA Octopus, is the primary survey tool used by divers, with visibility clouded to just one to two feet because of the four to five feet of mud and loose bottom of the Patapsco River.""

""Divers are forced to work in virtual darkness, because when lit, their view is similar to driving through a heavy snowfall at night with high-beam headlights on. So murky is the water, divers must be guided via detailed verbal directions from operators in vessels topside who are viewing real-time CODA imagery,"" Army Corps of Engineers pointed out.

They added that ""no usable underwater video exists of the wreckage"" because, as one Navy diver put it, ""there's no need to take video of something you can't even see.""

The complexity of this salvage operation suggests the main shipping channel will be closed for weeks if not months.

Salvage crews at the Port of Baltimore have opened up a temporary channel to keep commercial traffic flowing one week after the collapse of the 1.6-mile-long Francis Scott Key Bridge.

Officials said the narrow channel is 11 feet deep, with a 264-foot horizontal clearance and a 95-foot vertical clearance. Small barges were seen passing through the new channel, as the main shipping channel remained clogged with the mangled steel bridge twisted around the container ship ""Dali.""

""This marks an important first step along the road to reopening the port of Baltimore,"" US Coast Guard Captain David O'Connell, federal on-scene coordinator, said on Monday.

O'Connell said, ""By opening this alternate route, we will support the flow of marine traffic into Baltimore.""

New footage of the Key Bridge wreckagepic.twitter.com/9uUQdWGvlb

Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that federal officials have no timeline for reopening the main shipping channel or rebuilding the bridge.

""This is going to be a very complex process,"" Buttigieg said, adding, ""There are, even now, forces acting on that steel, so it takes a lot to make sure that it can be dismantled safely, to make sure that the vessel stays where it is supposed to be and doesn't swing out into the channel.""

On Monday, the Department of Defense stated three massive cranes have arrived at the collapsed bridge:

""The Chesapeake, a 1,000-ton lift capacity derrick barge, the Ferrell, a 200-ton lift capacity revolving crane barge, and the Oyster Bay, a 150-ton lift capacity crane barge have arrived in Baltimore Harbor.""

""An additional 400-ton lift capacity barge is on track to arrive early next week.""

On Monday evening, US Coast Guard Rear Admiral Shannon Gilreath told reporters that salvage operations underneath the water are even more complicated than initially imagined:

""These girders are essentially tangled together, intertwined, making it very difficult to figure out where you need to potentially cut so that we can make that into more manageable sizes to lift them from the water.""

At the same press conference, Governor Wes Moore said:

""We're talking about something that is almost the size of the Statue of Liberty ... and the scale of this project, to be clear, is enormous. And even the smallest (tasks) are huge.""

Even with a temporary channel reopened, activity at the Port of Baltimore has crashed and will remain paralyzed until the main shipping channel is reopened.

CBS News' Alex Glaze spoke with Scott Cowan, president of the local chapter of the International Longshoremen's Association, who warned, ""If there are no ships, there's no cargo. If there's no cargo, there is no work.""

Cowan said thousands of unionized port workers could lose their jobs.

ILA leaders have met with state and federal officials about the situation.

Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson introduced emergency legislation to the General Assembly to provide stimmy checks for ILA workers.

""In the coming days, the General Assembly will pass the PORT Act which will support workers not covered by our unemployment insurance system, ensure impacted businesses can retain their workforce and incentivize companies to come back to the Port after it reopens,"" Ferguson posted on X on Friday.

The bridge collapse could have been avoided or at least not a total disaster if Maryland officials had not neglected to spend millions of dollars to install anti-ship strike barriers around critical bridge supports. Also, despite the federal government immediately coming out one week ago and saying the container ship strike was not terror-related, some users on X continue to float the idea this could've been ""deliberate.""

2024-04-02 10:51:44,Who Is Behind The Gold Buying ?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240403112307/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-02/ross-norman-gold-quo-vadis-who-behind-gold-buying,"The rally in the gold price has left me non-plussed ... who is behind it and why ? Rather like an Agatha Christie murder-mystery novel, with evidence thin, the culprit or cause may be deduced by excluding what it is not ... and what remains, is.

Spoiler alert ... I am really not sure of the answer, but follow me ... it's fun anyway.

1.)Institutional buying... deeply unlikely; the gold ETFs have seen net redepemptions (or selling) for the whole of 2024 YTD, although there was a small spike in US buying that was matched by European selling, then faded. For sure this would have been the door that major institutions would have adopted if wishing to increase gold exposure.

2.)Speculators... the futures market is highly transparent with data reported weekly by the CFTC. For sure there has been an increase in the net long position but certainly not sufficient to account for the rally in gold prices. The initial rally was stoked by some short covering but one has a sense that conviction is fading.

3.)Western physical demand... a big nope. The all time high prices in local currencies, coupled with the speed of the move has prompted significant disinvestment by traditional coins and bar buyers. German dealers have been swamped by metal being sold back and a number of dealers have been caught with large stocks they cannot sell and hence apparently selling these at a discount to the spot price to reduce their cost of holding inventory.

Reflecting this reversal is possibly the leading gold buying platform BullionVault where sellers outnumber buyers as can be seen below ... in short, the consensus amongst typically gold bulls is that gold may have got ahead of itself.

4.)Central Banks... With gold demand running at over 1000 tonnes these last 2 years, which is double the run rate of the previous 5 years, this looks plausible. That said, firstly central bankers typically purchase through the official  benchmark and secondly these timid souls tend not to chase the market higher. But the buying is not on the ""fix"" and it has a degree of motivation and conviction that is not a hallmark of the rather more nuanced buying we expect from this quarter.

Quite possibly though their buying is coming through non-traditional routes. Their motivation for buying is clear ... not only is the world in a precarious position economically and geoplitically, but the over-use of sanctions and the weaponisation of the dollar will have persuaded many to increase the weighting towards non-dollar assets or reserves.

5.)China... With available retail savings of about 20 trillion yuan, a stock market in freefall and unrealized property sector losses, gold represents one of the few surefire and dependable investments... and they know it.

In Jan 2024 there was a staggering 271 tonnes of gold withrawals from the Shanghai Gold Exchange which is seen as a proxy for local demand. We also hear there have been well above average shipments of gold from the West to the East by security firms (now you know where all those western sales went) ... but again, not quite enough to account for the manner and extent of the gold rally.

But Chinese demand is opaque and news and reporting is often anecdotal. Some import entry points are well monitored (esp. Hong Kong) but other routes less so ... local premiums are known but often this can be misleading ... high premiums can be because demand is hot, or simply because availability is low (import quotas to banks being reduced by the PBoC for example). The prevailing high premiums in China of around $25 over the international price though can be more ascribed to limited supply than excessive demand.

6.)India... rivalling Chinese demand in size, but often with a different metre, Indian demand is central to price action too. Notoriously price sensitive it gives gold price its elasticity and tends to provide a floor to the market.

Indian dealers have an uncanny feel for the market and are a respected bell-wether. And today Indian dealers are sceptical of the gold rally and demand has cratered in the region even though we are in the wedding season. Reflecting this, local prices are trading at a discount to the international price which has deepened from $35 to $40 below. In short, Indian dealers is at odds with Chinese buyers... meanwhile the West continues to offload.

7.)Other... a much under-reported phenomenon is the role of algorithmic trading in gold trading - albeit very prominent in FX. Algos are all very different by design, but many are simply momentum followers. That is to say that in a rising market the next market price is more likely than not, to be higher. So they buy. The problem with this is that if too signifiant a factor in the mwrket, they can create their own weather. It may be rising BECAUSE they are buying and they can become locked into a self-fuelling cycle. Is this happening here ... maybe. I don't know. The point is the market is behaving atypically and these models care nothing for market fundamentals.

For example gold is rising despite falling investor, institutional and speculative demand .. it is rising despite headwinds from a stronger dollar, firmer treasury yields and a vix index that remains lacklustre. And it is rising despite the relative non-performance of silver which normally heralds a shift higher in the metals complex.

We had heard that some new US mutual funds had entered the market and they may be positioning themselves ahead of a US rate cuts later this year. But recent US data suggests inflation is sticky and the US economy outperforming with the expectations of a rate cut at the June FOMC falling beliow 50% ... yet gold then rallied to an all time high.

This is possibly the longest apology I have ever penned, but this gold rally mystifies me.

Quite possibly it is a combination of Chinese and official sector buying from other routes, coupled in some sectors with mounting uncertainty over US debt and its manageability. If so, then this could be regarded as extremely ""high quality"" buying in that it is unlikely to be reversed ... and this rally is strong and has legs to run ... on the other hand, if it is one of those damn algos then expect trouble ahead ... after all, momentum can travel in two directions.

Documenting the meatiest, juiciest cuts of “fat acceptance” propaganda from corporate and social media.

“This isn't a for-real suicide-thing. This is probably one of those cry-for-help things.”-Marla Singer, Fight Club

ViaEntertainment Weekly:

“The Grammy winner shared a frustrated Instagram post on Friday afternoon, venting about ‘lies being told about me for clout and views’ andconcluding with a cryptic announcement: ‘I quit.’

‘I'm getting tired of putting up with being dragged by everyone in my life and on the internet,’ Lizzo wrote in her post. ‘All I want is to make music and make people happy and help the world be a little better than how I found it. But I'm starting to feel like the world doesn't want me in it.’

‘I'm constantly up against lies being told about me for clout & views,’ she continued.‘Being the butt of the joke every single time because of how I look. My character being picked apart by people who don't know me and disrespecting my name. I didn't sign up for this s---. I quit.’

The vague announcement came with little warning, thoughLizzo did admit she was contemplating quitting music last June after being on the receiving end of a stream of body-shaming remarks. It remains unclear if Lizzo is merely taking a step back from social media or her career amid ongoing legal troubles or whether she intends to leave the music industry altogether. Her representatives did not immediately respond to EW's request for clarification…

In recent months,Lizzo has been mired in controversy, after three of her former back-up dancers filed a lawsuit suing the artist, her production company, and her dance captain for alleged sexual harassment, weight-shaming, racial discrimination, and creating a ‘hostile work environment.’”

Frankly, although I still can’t endorse the practice in principle, it’s refreshing to see a non-white, non-male celebrity get sued for the old “hostile work environment” racket.

Related:Lawsuit Filed: A Fat Activist and Her Three Backup Dancers Walk Into a Brothel…

The whole “I’m quitting because you called me fat” routine is rich coming from a morbidly obese fat icon who got famous bragging about being a slobby human-walrus hybrid as a novel form of feminist self-empowerment.

For all the legions of Lizzo fans in theArmageddon Proseaudience, fret not and rest assured the diverse Slay Queen will be back into the spotlight to gyrate her disgusting ass on BET tout de suite.

Like a moth to flame, she can’t stay away from the warm embrace of the limelight.

Oh, the irony of lamenting fatphobia while selling the fats expensive drugs to fix their obesity!

The cognitive dissonance is strong in this one — assuming she can hear herself think over the cash register clinking sound effect going off in her brain off of her latest (probable) multi-million-dollar pharma sponsorship deal.

“’For 25 years, making fun of my weight was national sport,’ Oprah Winfrey saidduring the opening monologuefor An Oprah Special: Shame, Blame and the Weight Loss Revolution, which aired Monday on ABC and is now available to stream on Hulu…

‘I come to this conversation with the hope that we can start releasing the stigma and the shame and the judgment, to stop shaming other people for being overweight or how they choose to lose – or not lose – weight and, most importantly, to stop shaming ourselves,’said Winfrey,who in late 2023 revealed she was taking anti-obesity medicineand received both support [and] backlash.”

More cognitive dissonance:

·       we need to stop “stigmatizing” and “shaming” fats for their obesity,and

·       it’s a great idea to sell the rubes drugs that cost in excess of $1,000/month to eliminate said obesity.

These are mutually contradictory tenets that would give an honest person with any sense of integrity or shame pause to reconsider. But let’s not delude ourselves regarding the caliber of person we’re dealing with here.

Anyway, here is Oprah with a theatrical parade of former and current fats — probably themselves also handsomely paid by the industry to put on the show — lauding the Ozempic miracles they witnessed conjured up by the pharmaceutical gods, channeled through their diverse meat puppet Lady Holy Virgin Oprah in her pristine baby-blue pantsuit:

And now an unrelated word fromArmageddon Prosepatron-saint, Bill Hicks:

“If anyone here is in advertising or marketing, kill yourself. Just a little thought, I’m just trying to plant seeds… Kill yourself… There’s no rationalization for what you do, and you are Satan’s little helpers, okay? Kill yourselves. Seriously… There’s no ****ing joke coming… You are Satan’s spawn filling the world with vile and garbage, you are ****ed… Kill yourself. It’s the only way to save your ****ing soul. Kill yourself. Planting seeds… I know all the marketing people are going ‘he’s just doing a joke’; there’s no joke here whatsoever. Suck a tailpipe, ****ing hang yourself…. I don’t care how you do it.”

You make a deal with the devil, it’s for life, as my Midwestern Irish-Catholic grandmammy used to say.

“Millions of Americans who have dropped pounds and boosted their health using popular obesity drugs like Wegovy are facing a new dilemma:What happens if they stop taking them?

Many worry, rightly, that they’ll regain weight and revert to old habits.In clinical trials, patients who paused the drugs put back on most of the weight they lost.

But others are gambling on a do-it-yourself strategy to ease off the drugs and stay slim by stretching out doses, taking the medication intermittently or stopping and starting again only if needed.

‘To me, it’s a help, it’s an aid,’ saidDonna Cooper, 62, of Front Royal, Virginia, wholost nearly 40 pounds in nine months using Wegovyalong with diet and exercise.‘At some point you have to come off of them. I don’t want to be on them forever.’”

Donna, bless her heart, appears to be a bit confused about how this hustle works.Shemight not want to be on Wegovy forever, but its purveyor most certainlydoeswant her on it forever. That’s the whole business model.

“But many people don't stick with it. One recent study published in the journal Obesity found that just 40% of patients who filled a prescription for Wegovy in 2021 or 2022 were still taking it a year later.

Doctors who treat obesity stress that the disease is a chronic condition that must be managed indefinitely, like heart disease or high blood pressure. The new injection drugs work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness.They were designed — and tested — to be taken continuously, experts said.

‘We are not an injection shop,’ saidDr. Andres Acosta, an obesity researcherand medical adviser at the Mayo Clinic.‘I don’t think they should be used in intermittent fashion.It’s not approved for that. They don’t work like that.’”

The extent to which morbidly obese feminists will reach to justify their appalling BMIs under the auspices of Social Justice™ or whatever never fail to disappoint.

Such is the case with “Hunger: A Memoir of My Body,” in which the49-year-old(relevant fact) “Bad Feminist” author pins her obesity on a gang-rape from childhood.

“From the New York Times bestselling author of Bad Feminist: a searingly honest memoir of food, weight, self-image, and learning how to feed your hunger while taking care of yourself.

‘I ate and ate and ate in the hopes that if I made myself big, my body would be safe. I buried the girl I was because she ran into all kinds of trouble. I tried to erase every memory of her, but she is still there, somewhere. . . . I was trapped in my body, one that I barely recognized or understood, but at least I was safe.’

In her phenomenally popular essays and long-running Tumblr blog, Roxane Gay has written with intimacy and sensitivity about food and body, using her own emotional and psychological struggles as a means of exploring our shared anxieties over pleasure, consumption, appearance, and health. As a woman who describes her own body as ‘wildly undisciplined,’ Roxane understands the tension between desire and denial, between self-comfort and self-care. In Hunger,she explores her past—including the devastating act of violence that acted as a turning point in her young life—and brings readers along on her journey to understand and ultimately save herself.

With the bracing candor, vulnerability, and power that have made her one of the most admired writers of her generation, Roxane explores what it means to learn to take care of yourself: how to feed your hungers for delicious and satisfying food, a smaller and safer body, and a body that can love and be loved—in a time when the bigger you are, the smaller your world becomes.”

The essential thesis of this book is that the author’s obesity — again, at age 49 — is the reductionist result of a gang rape she experienced at the age of 12.

I don’t want to come off as unempathetic. I do believe, taking this woman’s account at face value, that a gang-rape of a child would probably have traumatic effects that reverberate across time.

But I’m not sure of the usefulness or veracity of the self-defeating takeaway that her obesity is her fate, based on factors outside of her control as a victim, serves. She appears to suggest, based on the interview above and the synopsis of her book, that her morbid obesity is something to be accepted as is because there’s nothing that can be done about it due to an event that occurred 37 years in the past.

What kind of a message does that send to the reader, aside from capitulation and fatalism as a paper-thin facsimile of feminist empowerment?

The vast majority of obese individuals didn’t end up that way because of emotional trauma following childhood sexual abuse — some, probably, but certainly not most or all — and I imagine the majority of gang rape victims don’t go on to develop obesity or any kind of eating disorder.

So what this woman is doing is taking a very personal, specific narrative and making sweeping, self-serving generalizations about its societal implications to the detriment of the health of anyone who soaks it up uncritically and takes it as a license to live out their short lives weight 300 pounds on account of real or perceived psychological trauma.

Whatever this genre of feminism is about, it’s not empowerment or self-actualization.

Discussing the recent ""earnings disappointment""at Berkshire's energy subsidiary, BHE (Berkshire Hathaway Energy) which generates over 30 gigawatts of power and is one of the largest US energy distributors, and lamenting the regulatory chaos across various blue states (most notably California), Buffett said that ""when the dust settles, America’s power needs and the consequent capital expenditure will be staggering.I did not anticipate or even consider the adverse developments in regulatory returns and, along with Berkshire’s two partners at BHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so.""

The Omaha Billionaire is not the only one to raise the red flag about the coming electricity crisis.

In anop-ed titled just that, the WSJ editorial board writes that while Biden and the press ""keep raising alarms about a climate crisis that his policies can’t do much about,in the meantime they’re ignoring how government climate policies are contributing to a looming electric-grid crisis that is more urgent and could be avoided.""The oped then expands on Buffett's fatalistic ruminations:

The first quake, with amagnitude of 7.4, struck at 7:58pm ET(7:58am local time) andhad an epicenter located about 18 kilometers(11 miles) south of the city of Hualien and shook buildings in the capital Taipei.

It’s the biggest seismic event by magnitude since 1999, when the so-called 921 quake hit the island and killed more than 2,000 people, Taiwan weather authorities said during a press conference. There have been several aftershocks clustered on the island’s east coast.

The second quake, with amagnitude of 6.5, hit 13 minutes later at 8:11pm ET, and was lcoated at almost the exact same spot as the first one: its epicenter was about 11 kilometers northeast of Hualien City.

Hualien announced plans to shut down offices and schools Wednesday in the wake of the event. The island’s power provider, meanwhile, said nuclear power plant operations remain normal and power distribution in Taiwan had stabilized.

People on the Chinese social platform Weibo said they felt the quake all across China, including in Shanghai and Guangdong.

Tsunami waves reaching 1-to-3 meters were possible along some coasts of China and Taiwan, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. A tsunami warning was also issued for southwestern Japan’s Okinawa prefecture after the region was rocked by the quake.

A tsunami warning — meaning waves of up to 3 meters are possible — was issued for Okinawa on Wednesday morning after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Taiwan, according to the Meteorological Agency.https://t.co/6AtF6Kjr2l

Local residents were urged to evacuate from an expected tsunami of as high as 3 meters, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.

Clips posted on X showed local damage and landslides in the aftermath of the strong quake.

Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Michigan) has come under fire for sayingGaza should be handled like ""Hiroshima and Nagasaki,""suggesting that he was calling for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on the Strip, which could kill millions of Palestinians.

Walberg made the commentsat a town hall last weekwhen asked about the US funding the construction of a port in Gaza, supposedly to bring in more aid.""We shouldn't be spending a dime on humanitarian aid,""he said.""It should be like Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Get it over quick.""

The genocidal comments became public when they surfaced in a video on social media. In response to the controversy, Walberg claimed he wasusing a ""metaphor""by naming the only two cities in the world that have ever been hit with a nuclear bomb.

""I used a metaphor to convey the need for both Israel and Ukraine to win their wars as swiftly as possible, without putting American troops in harm’s way,"" he claimed. ""As a child who grew up in the Cold War era, the last thing I’d advocate for would be the use of nuclear weapons,"" he sought to explain.

""My reasoning was the exact opposite of what is being reported:the quicker these wars end, the fewer innocent lives will be caught in the crossfire.""

Israeli officials have frequently pointed to the US and Allied bombings of Germany and Japan during World War II to justify the mass killing of civilians in Gaza.Military historians say the destruction in Gaza is on par with the destruction of German cities, which are some of the most heavily bombed places in history.

Walberg came under heavy criticism from fellow Michigan politicians for his reference to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, includingformer Rep. Justin Amash, a Palestinian-American who lost family members to Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza.

Amash said Walberg’s comments ""evince an utter indifference to human suffering. The people of Gaza are our fellow human beings—many of them children trapped in horrific circumstances beyond their individual control.

A video has widely circulated of Walberg's original comments:

Michigan Congressman Tim Walberg, pastor and ""good"" Christian, talks about his solution for#Gaza: Give it the Hiroshima treatment. ""Get it over quick.""A sitting US Rep in a secret town hall feels comfortable musing positively about genocide. Listen. Share.#DemCastMI#DemCastpic.twitter.com/6BQGfWMVjZ

""For him to suggest that hundreds of thousands of innocent Palestinians should be obliterated,including my own relatives sheltering at an Orthodox Christian church, is reprehensible and indefensible,"" Amash continued.

2024-04-02 22:00:00,Squatters' Rights By State,https://web.archive.org/web/20240403112307/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/squatters-rights-state#comment-stream,"The debate about squatters' rights in the United States has been heating up to the point where it elicited a response from the Biden Administration this week.

In a statement it saidthatit was ""critical that local governments take action""and that issues over squatters' rights were watched by the administration but considered a local issue.

As Statista's Katharina Buchholz reports,a string of high-profile squatting cases - with many centering on New York City - have made headlines recently. In February, news broke about a New York couple who had purchased a home in the suburb of Queens for long-term use of their disabled son, but was failing to evict atenantwho was a caretaker for the recently deceased former owner and had been expected to move out.However, as he had occupied the house for more than 30 days with alleged permission from the former owner, he couldn't be easily evicted under New York City Law.In another NYC case,squatters are suspected to have killed a 52-year-old womanin March who entered her deceased mother's apartment after having traveled from abroad to hand it over to new tenants.

In the state as a whole, this law is not on the books.

Like in many states, however, New York’s squatters or adverse possession laws kick in after 10 years and allow a squatter to stake claim to a property after this time period, as seen indata published by the American Apartment Owners Association.

Cases of squatters earning rights in this context are rare, but not unheard of.

In 2008,Oakland man Steven DeCaprio moved into an abandoned housein the city, fixed it up and successfully sued not only for occupancy, but for ownership in a process called adverse possession. In California, five years of continuous occupation are enough to stake a claim like DeCaprio's but the process isarduous and includes being up to date on tax payments for the property, something that local authorities might not accept.

Not taking into account the additional legal difficulties some claims under squatters rights face, California's required occupancy period is one of the shortest in the country together with Montana's.

You will find more infographics atStatista

Periods of seven years are on the books in Arkansas, Florida, Utah and Tennessee, even though the Florida statute will change as of July 1.

Washington's required period is pushed back to seven years as well if property taxes are paid and otherwise it is 10 years, like in several other statesincluding Texas, Oregon, Arizona and South Carolina.

New Jersey and Louisiana employ the longest periods at 30 years.

2024-04-02 22:20:00,White House Does Not Mention 'Transgender Day Of Visibility' on Spanish-Language Accounts,https://web.archive.org/web/20240403112307/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/white-house-does-not-mention-transgender-day-visibility-spanish-language-accounts#comment-stream,"Authored by Eric Lendrum via American Greatness,

In yet another display of selective pandering and political hypocrisy,the Biden Administration notably did not make any mention of “Transgender Day of Visibility” on its Spanish-language social media accounts, instead only referring to it on the normal English-language accounts.

As reported by theDaily Caller, the “Transgender Day of Visibility” was announced by the Biden White House to be on the same day as Easter Sunday, March 31st, a move that sparked widespread backlash and ridicule. While the White House’s X and Facebook accounts posted about it on Sunday, the Spanish-language versions, “La Casa Blanca,”made no such mentions of the new holiday.

However, both the English- and Spanish-language accounts did make posts commemorating Easter itself.

WhenWhite House spokesman Andrew Bateswas asked about the discrepancy, hedodged the question completely and instead tried to turn it back around on conservative media.

“That’s the case with most tweets from the English language account,” said Bates.

“We’re grateful that FOX agrees with President Biden about recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility, having previously tweeted, ‘Trans Day of Visibility is dedicated to celebrating transgender people. To all the transgender men, women and non-binary folx, we see you and stand with you.’”

“As a Christian who celebrates Easter with family, President Biden stands for bringing people together and upholding the dignity and freedoms of every American,” Bates said in a later statement.

“Sadly, it’s unsurprising politicians are seeking to divide and weaken our country with cruel, hateful and dishonest rhetoric. President Biden will never abuse his faith for political purposes or for profit.”

The “Transgender Day of Visibility” is one ofover 50 pro-LGBTQ commemorative daysnow recognized by the Biden Administration and multiple far-left groups.

2024-04-02 23:00:00,Compassionately Communicating Life: Kristi Noem,https://web.archive.org/web/20240403112307/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/compassionately-communicating-life-kristi-noem#comment-stream,"Commentary by South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem via RealClear Wire,

In 2022, the pro-life movement experienced a massive victory: For the first time in 50 years, the Supreme Court returned decision-making about abortion back to the states – to the people.

Immediately after, the left and their allies in the media eagerly continued their half-century-long disinformation campaign to confuse the American people about what the ruling actually meant. Democrats lied to the American people that abortion had now been banned entirely, that mothers receiving abortions would be prosecuted, or that back-alley abortions would suddenly become the norm.

None of that is true.

And in this election cycle, Democrats will once again purposefully deceive the American people on this issue. We cannot allow these blatant lies to spread and must talk about life issues with truth, compassion, and hope.

Every pregnancy involves two lives: a mom and an unborn baby. As South Dakota’s largest healthcare provider testified to our state legislature this past February, “We recognize that each time a mother walks through our doors, we’ve been entrusted with the health of two patients: the mother and the child.”

In my state, we showed moms we are here to help them – that they are never alone.We expanded Paid Family Leave access for state employees; provided pregnancy counseling, resources, and tips on parenting; pointed moms and families towards available financial assistance; and even offered help on adopting a child or giving a child up for adoption. We createdBright Startto match first-time moms to available nursing services during pregnancy and up until their child’s second birthday.

There’s more to do, butSouth Dakota stepped up and protected mothers and their babies with significant policy prescriptions designed to address many concerns.I’m a pro-life governor, and I’m proud of what we’ve done in my state. But what we support in South Dakota may not have support in South Carolina. That’s what the Supreme Court decision actually did – turn those issues back to the people in each state so they can decide.

I realize many in my own party don’t want to talk about this issue. However, the national conversation about abortion will only increase as we approach the November elections. Republicans should not and cannot be afraid to defend our position to protect mothers and their babies, expose lies from the left, and go on offense to expose the radical left’s extreme position on abortion.

The radical left claims “abortion access is being restricted,” butmore abortions took place in 2023after the Supreme Court decision than in the years prior. The left says pro-life laws will lead to higher maternal mortality, but maternal mortality actually dropped by 60% in South Dakota in the first full year after the Court’s ruling.We have to expose that every Democrat in the U.S. Senatevoted to allow abortionat any time, for any reason, right up until the moment of birth,and they demanded that you pay for it. Polling by Rasmussen shows a vast majority, 86% of the American people, reject the Democratic Party’s position.

A majority of the people clearly agree with us on this issue and many others facing America.

It’s bad enough that Democrats can’t define what a “woman” is – they also continue to belittle us by portraying women as single-issue voters who only care about abortion. The fact is only 16% of women in Michigan – a key swing state in the upcoming election – are single-issue abortion voters. While abortion will undoubtedly be an issue in the 2024 elections, polls show women care more about how illegal immigration is making them less safe in their communities, how persistent high gas and food prices cause them to struggle to take care of their families, and how America’s decline on the world stage will shape their kids’ future.

Simply put,the America First Conservative policies are proven to be successful– and represent the best hope for a healthy, happy, and prosperous life for Americans who are born and unborn. This is the fight, and if we’re going to win hearts and minds, we can’t be afraid to enter the ring.

2024-04-02 23:20:00,China Is The World Leader In Battery Recycling,https://web.archive.org/web/20240403112307/https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/china-world-leader-battery-recycling#comment-stream,"As many countries around the world scramble towards a green transition,a new era of electric cars is being ushered inand with it comes the need for batteries.

While these batteries - also needed for home, industrial and grid energy storage - are being newly manufactured,Statista's Anna Fleck reportsthatthe market for therecycling of lithium-ion batteriesis growing too, especially since it “conserves the critical minerals and other valuable materials that are used in batteries and is a more sustainable approach than disposal”,as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencywrites.

Data fromACS Energy Lettcited in anarticleby Maria Virginia Olano on Canary Media shows howChina was the leading country for this type of battery recycling in 2021,with 188,000 tons of existing and planned lithium-ion battery recycling capacity per year. It was followed by Germany and the United States, albeit with both countries lagging some way behind.

You will find more infographics atStatista

Since 2021, there have been even more plans for the expansion of lithium-ion battery recycling plants.According to researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, while the majority of lithium-ion battery recycling capacity is located in East Asia, Europe is also building capacity andcould increase its recycling capacities to an estimated 400,000 tons per year by 2025.

The extent to which policy exists on battery recycling varies greatly by country and region.For example, the European Council has now agreed to set the target for lithium recovery from waste batteries to 50 percent by 2027 and 80 percent in 2031 and has said that there will be a new rule onmandatory minimum levels of recycled content for industrial, SLI batteries and EV batteries. Olano of Canary Media argues that it’s the comparative lack of policy supporting the growth of lithium-ion battery recycling in the U.S. in past years that has held the country back in this regard, falling behind markets in Asia and Europe.

One Bloomberganalysissays, however, thatthe recycling industry has “boomed too soon” in the U.S., as there are too many recycling plants and not enough discarded batteries to recycle, and “there won't be for more than a decade”.

2024-04-03 02:00:00,Escobar: The Sahel's 'Axis Of Resistance',https://web.archive.org/web/20240403112307/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/escobar-sahels-axis-resistance,"Authored by Pepe Escobar via The Cradle,

The African Sahel is revolting against western neocolonialism – ejecting foreign troops and bases, devising alternative currencies, and challenging the old multinationals. Multipolarity, after all, cannot flower without resistance paving its path...

The emergence ofAxes of Resistancein various geographies is an inextricable byproduct of the long and winding process leading us toward a multipolar world. These two things – resistance to the Hegemon and the emergence of multipolarity – are absolutely complementary.

The Axis of Resistance in West Asia – across Arab and Muslim states – now finds as its soul sister the Axis of Resistance spanning the Sahel in Africa, west to east, from Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger to Chad, Sudan, and Eritrea.

Unlike Niger, where the change in power against neocolonialism was associated with a military coup, in Senegal, the power change comes straight from the polls.

Senegal plunged itself into a new era with the landslide victory of Bassirou Diomaye Faye, 44, in nationwide elections on 24 March. A former tax inspector who had just spent a fortnight stint in jail, Faye emerged with the profile of an underdog pan-African leader to turn the ‘most stable democracy in Africa,’ under French puppet incumbent Macky Sall, upside down.

The incoming Senegalese president now joins Ibrahim Traore, 36, in Burkina Faso, Aby Ahmed, 46, in Ethiopia, Andry Rajoelina, 48, in Madagascar, as well as future superstar Julius Malema, 44, in South Africa as part of the new, young pan-African generation focused on sovereignty. In his election manifesto, Faye pledged to reclaim Senegal's sovereignty no less thaneighteentimes.

Geoeconomics is key to these shifts.As Senegal becomes a substantial oil and gas producer, Faye will aim to renegotiate mining and energy contracts, including the largest ones with British Petroleum (BP) and UK gold mine operator, Endeavor Mining.

Crucially, he plans to ditch the exploitative CFA franc – the French-controlled currency system used in 14 African states – even setting up a new currency as part of reshaping relations with neocolonial power France, Senegal's top trading partner. Faye, echoing Comrade Xi Jinping, wants a ""win-win"" partnership.

Faye has not yet been clear on whether he intends to kick the French military out of Senegal. Were that to happen, the blow to Paris would be unprecedented, as embattledPetit RoiEmmanuel Macron and the French establishment consider Senegal the key player when it comes to blockading landlocked Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso, which have already left Paris in the (Sahel) dust.

The three latter states, which have just formed an Alliance of the Sahel States (Alliance des Etats du Sahel, AES, in the original French), are not only a major Paris nightmare after serial humiliations but also a big American headache – epitomized in the spectacular breakdown of military cooperation between Washington and Nigerien capital Niamey.

The culprit, according to the US Deep State, is, of course, Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Obviously, no one in the US Beltway has been paying due attention to the Russia–Africa diplomatic flurry since last year, involving all key players from the Sahel to the new African BRICS members Egypt and Ethiopia.

In sharp contrast to its prior regard of Niger as a staunch ally in the Sahel, Washington is now forced to present a calendar date to get its troops out of Niger – after a military cooperation deal was annulled. The Pentagon cannot be involved in military training in Nigerien territory anymore.

There are two key bases – in Agadez and Niamey – which the Pentagon spent over $150 million to build.Niamey was finished only in 2019 and is managed by the US military's African Command, AFRICOM.

Operational objectives are, predictably, shrouded in mystery. The Niamey base is essentially an intel center, processing data collected by MQ-9 Reaper drones. The US Air Force also uses the Dirkou Aerodrome as a base for operations in the Sahel.

Now things get really exciting, because the presence of a de facto CIA drone base in Dirkou, manned by a handful of operatives, is not even acknowledged. This dark base allows intel collection everywhere in Central Africa, from west to north. Call it another classic example of former CIA director Mike Pompeo's ""We Lie, We Cheat, We Steal.""

There are roughly 1,000 US troops in Niger who may soon face ejection.The Americans are trying everything to stem the bleeding. Only this month, US Undersecretary of State for Africa Molly Phee visited Niger twice. Losing bases in Niger will translate into Washington following Paris in losing control of the Sahel – as Niger gets closer to Russia and Iran.

These bases are not essential to exercise surveillance over the Bab al-Mandeb; it's all about the Sahel, with drones operating on their limit and violating every sovereign air space in sight.

Incidentally, a hefty delegation from Niamey visited Moscow in January. Then, last week, Putin discussed security cooperation in phone calls with Mali's interim President, Assimi Goita, and Niger's military junta President Abdourahmane Tchiani before talking to the Republic of Congo's President Denis Nguesso.

Pro-west puppet regimes are dwindling fast all across the African continent. The Alliance of the Sahel States – Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger – may be the vanguard of an African Axis of Resistance, but there's more, in the form of South Africa, Ethiopia, and Egypt as full BRICS members – not to mention serious candidates for the next wave of BRICS+, such as Algeria and Nigeria.

Russia, diplomatically, and China, commercially, plus the full weight of the Russia–China strategic partnership, are clearly focused on the long game – counting on Africa as a whole as a key multipolar player. Additional evidence was provided once again during themultipolar conference last month in Moscow, where charismatic pan-African leader Kemi Seba from Benin was one of the superstars.

Pan-Eurasian diplomatic circles even allow themselves to joke about the recent hissy fits byLe Petit Roiin Paris. The utter humiliation of France in the Sahel is likely one of the drivers of Macron's chest-thumping threats to send French troops to Ukraine – who would be turned into steak tartare by the Russians in record time – and his eagerness to support Armenia's current Russophobic stunts.

Historically, the fact remains, that Africans considered the former USSR much more pliable and even supportive when it came to siphoning natural resources; that goodwill has now also been transferred to China.

As a regional integration platform, the Alliance of the Sahel States has everything it takes to become a game-changer. Senegal under Faye may eventually join, but Guinea already offers the geographical capacity to provide the alliance with credible maritime access. That will lead to the progressive extinction of the western-controlled, Nigeria-based ECOWAS.

Yet, never dismiss the Hegemon's mighty tentacles. The Pentagon master plan does not entail abandoning Africa to a multipolar Russia–China–Iran sphere of influence. Yet no one across the Sahel's Axis of Resistance buys the US 'terror threat' card anymore. There was virtually zero terror in Africa until 2011, when NATO turned Libya into a wasteland, then put boots on the ground and erected military bases across the continent.

So far, the Alliance of the Sahel States is winning the sovereignty-first information war, hands-down.But there's no question the Empire will strike back. After all, the whole game is tied to the Beltway's supreme paranoia of Russia taking over the Sahel and Central Africa.

Enter the Ivory Coast, now that Senegal may be about to start flirting with the Alliance of the Sahel States.

Ivory Coast is more strategic to Washington than, for instance, Chad because Ivorian territory is very close to the Sahel alliance. Still, Chad has already recalibrated its foreign policy, which is no longer Western-controlled and comes with a new emphasis on getting closer to Moscow.

What lies ahead for Empire?Perhaps US 'anti-terror' drones shared with Paris at the French base in the Ivory Coast to keep the Sahel alliance in check. Call it the humiliated Gallic rooster embracing the Hegemon in West Africa without receiving even the crumbs of a stale croissant.

The defense chief said in the interview with the Austrian newspaperDie Pressethat all NATO countries already have NATO personnel stationed in Ukraine, but that they aren't directly engaged in hostilities as they are there in advisory roles. He was responding to recent provocative statements by France's Macron.

""The reality is that every NATO member country already has military personnel in Ukraine, such as military attaches or people who travel to Ukraine from time to time,"" the Estonian defense chief said. ""What [French] President [Emmanuel] Macron said mainly related to personnel training,"" he added,accordingto a translation in Russian media.

Starting in late February Macron had told a gathering of top defense officials in Paris that Western boots on the ground in Ukraine should be an option as ""we cannot exclude anything"" in the pursuit of preventing Russia from winning the war.

Still, in the interview Pevkur emphasized that currently there's no serious talk of NATO troops directly participating in fighting and that""this has already been ruled out.""

However, he did preview a very dangerous potential plan which would certainly lead to escalation: ""Western defense officials arecurrently planning to set up training camps in Ukraine in a bid to avoid issues with border crossingsand to speed up the preparation process,"" Pevkursaidto the Vienna-based publication.

Already, Moscow has accused France of having significant numbers of its Foreign Legion present on the front lines. Russia has said it has attacked their positions in places like Kharkiv.

Some European leaders have revealed information in the recent past which shows Defense Minister Pevkur's words to be accurate.

For example in February British Prime Minister Sunak'soffice saidthat the UK is not planning a ""large-scale deployment of troops"" in Ukraine...""Other than a small number of personnel who are in the countrysupporting the Ukrainian armed forces, we have no plans for a large-scale deployment.""

Dangerously, this shows that little by little, inch by inch, nuclear armed superpowers are at this rate continuously moving toward direct conflict in Ukraine.

2024-04-03 03:30:00,Brussels Begins To Mobilise Its Mass Censorship Regime For Upcoming EU Elections,https://web.archive.org/web/20240403112307/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/brussels-begins-mobilise-its-mass-censorship-regime-upcoming-eu-elections#comment-stream,"Authored by Nick Corbishley via NakedCapitalism.com,

This is the culmination of a process that beganat leasta decade ago.

One of the most important (albeit least reported) developments of 2023 was the launch of the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA), which came into full effect in late August and which we covered in the article,The EU’s Mass Censorship Regime Is Almost Fully Operational. Will It Go Global?The goal of the DSA is to combat — i.e., suppress — mis- and disinformation online, not just in Europe but potentially across the world and is part of a broader trend of Western governments actively pushing to censor information on the Internet as they gradually lose control over the narrative.

Here’s how it works: so-called Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) and Search Engines (VLSEs) — those with more than 45 million active monthly users in the EU — are required to censor content hosted on their platforms deemed to be illegal by removing it, blocking it, or providing certain information to the authorities concerned. Platforms are also required to tackle hate speech, dis- or misinformation if it is deemed to have “actual or foreseeable negative effects on civic discourse and electoral processes, and public security” and/or “actual or foreseeable negative effects in relation to gender-based violence, the protection of public health and minors and serious negative consequences to the person’s physical and mental well-being.”

Besides take-downs and outright suspensions, other familiar tools at the disposal of tech platforms include de-monetisation, content demotion, shadow-banning and account visibility filtering. The European Commission has primary, but not exclusive, regulatory responsibility for VLOPs and VLOSEs. The same requirements now also apply to all other online service providers, though responsibility for execution and enforcement lies not with the Commission but national authorities.

So far, the platforms, including even Elon Musk’s X, appear to be adhering to the EU’s rules on disinformation. If they weren’t, they could face serious economic consequences, including fines of up to 6% of global turnover, as well as the looming threat of warrantless inspections of company premises. The X platform (formerly known as Twitter) may have left the EU’s voluntary code of practice last summer and in December washit with a probeover disinformation related to Hamas’s October 7 attack, but its actions — or rather lack of actions — since then suggest it is indeed complying with the rules.

As Robert KogonreportsforBrownstone Institute, (granted, not the most popular source of information on NC, but this is another solid, well researched piece by Kogon on a topic virtually no one else is talking about), “while Musk and the Twitter Files are so verbose about alleged ‘US government censorship,'” they “have remained suitably mum about EU censorship demands”:

[I]t is strictly impossible that Twitter has not had and is not continuing to have contact – indeed extensive and regular contact – with EU officials about censoring content and accounts that the European Commission deems “mis-” or “disinformation.” But we have heard absolutely nothing about this in the “Twitter Files.”

Why? The answer is: because EU censorshipreally isgovernment censorship, i.e. censorship that Twitter isrequiredto carry outon pain of sanction. This is the difference between the EU censorship and what Elon Musk himself has denounced as“US government censorship.”The latter has amounted to nudges and requests, but was never obligatory and could never be obligatory, thanks to the First Amendment and the fact that there has never been any enforcement mechanism. Any law creating such an enforcement mechanism would be obviously unconstitutional. Hence, Twitter could always simply say no…

Far from any sign of defiance of the Code and the DSA, what we get from Elon Musk is repeated pledges of fealty: like the belowtweetthat he posted after meeting with EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton in January. (For an earlier such pledge in the form of a joint video message with Breton, seehere.)

Now, the European Commission has its sights set on the EU’s parliamentary elections, to be held in June. “Integrity of election[s] is one of my top priorities for DSA enforcement, as we are entering a period of elections in Europe,” Breton the EnforcertoldPoliticolast September.

Elections in Slovakia in September were supposed to offer a dummy run, but the results were underwhelming, at least as far as the Commission was concerned. The left-wing populist and social conservative party, Direction–Social Democracy (Smer-SD), led by former Prime Minister Robert Fico, took the largest number of votes and was able to form a coalition government with like-minded parties. Ficohad promisedto cut all aid to Ukraine, which he says is governed by neo-Nazis, as well as block its ascension to NATO.

The Commission is determined to up its game, however. Last week, it published aset of guidelinesfor Big Tech firms to help Brussels “secure” the upcoming elections from foreign interference and other threats. The guidelines recommend “mitigation measures and best practices to be undertaken by Very Large Online Platforms and Search Engines before, during, and after electoral events,” and are explained as necessary in order to prevent things like fake news, turnout suppression, cyber threats and attacks, and, of course, Russia’s malign influence on European public opinion, particularly regarding Ukraine.

“In the European Union we speak about the Kremlin, which is very successful in creating narratives which can influence the voting preferences of the people,” said EU Vice-President for Values and Transparency, Věra Jourová, in arecent interviewwith the Atlantic Council, a neocon think tank that knows a thing or two about disinformation having played aleading rolein the ProporNot fiasco that baselessly outed hundreds of alternative news websites as Russian propagandists including this one. “And lying, just lies… Disinformation in order to influence elections in a way that the people in Europe will stop to support (sic) Ukraine.”

Here is, word for word, the full list of the EU’s demands for the platforms, interspersed with a few observations and speculations of my own (italicised and in brackets). The platforms are instructed to:

“Reinforce their internal processes, including by setting up internal teams with adequate resources, using available analysis and information on local context-specific risks and on the use of their services by users to search and obtain information before, during and after elections, to improve their mitigation measures.”

(This maysound eerily familiar to the US government’s censorship efforts revealed by the Twitter files, but there is a key difference: the processes in the US were largely covert and informal, with nothing in the way of legal consequences in the case of non-compliance. By contrast, the EU’s DSA ensures that the processes are not just overt and legally authorised, they are backed up with the very real threat of substantial economic sanctions).

“Implement elections-specific risk mitigation measurestailored to each individual electoral period and local context. Among the mitigation measures included in the guidelines, Very Large Online Platforms and Search Engines should promote official information on electoral processes, implement media literacy initiatives, and adapt their recommender systems to empower users and reduce the monetisation and virality of content that threatens the integrity of electoral processes. Moreover,political advertising should be clearly labelled as such, in anticipation of thenew regulation on the transparency and targeting of political advertising.”

(The first sentence serves as a reminder that these processes will be applied not only to EU elections. As the Commission’sannouncementon X makes clear, it also plans to “protect the integrity” of 17 national or local elections across Europe this year. What about elections in other regions of the world? For example, the US’ general election in November, on which so much rests, including quite possibly the future of NATO. Clearly, the European Commission and the national governments of many EU member states have a vested interest in trying to prevent another Trump triumph).

“Adopt specific mitigation measures linked to generative AI: Very Large Online Platforms and Search Engines whose services could be used to create and/or disseminate generative AI content should assess and mitigate specific risks linked to AI, for example by clearly labelling content generated by AI (such as deepfakes), adapting their terms and conditions accordingly and enforcing them adequately.”

(The EU has just passed its AI Act, one of whose ostensible purposes is to tackle the threat posed by AI-generated videos and other recordings. As high-quality deep fakes are becoming harder to desire, this is a growing challenge. For the moment, the Commission is relying on the DSA to address these risks for the upcoming EU elections).

“Cooperate with EU level and national authorities, independent experts, and civil society organisationsto foster an efficient exchange of information before, during and after the election and facilitate the use of adequate mitigation measures, including in the areas of Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI), disinformation and cybersecurity.”

(As readers no doubt appreciate, this level ofcollusion between government and big tech platforms — the ultimate public-private partnership — aimed at controlling the message throughout an election period, is exceedingly dangerous. Even the EFF, which has praised many aspects of the DSA,warnsthat “Issues with government involvement in content moderationare pervasive and whilst trusted flaggers are not new, the DSA’s system could have a significant negative impact on the rights of users, in particular that of privacy and free speech.”)

“Adopt specific measures, including an incident response mechanism, during an electoral periodto reduce the impact of incidents that could have a significant effect on the election outcome or turnout.”

“Assess the effectiveness of the measuresthroughpost-election reviews. Very Large Online Platforms and Search Engines should publish a non-confidential version of such post-election review documents, providing opportunity for public feedback on the risk mitigation measures put in place.”

(This last point feels as though it is intended to give this vast entreprise a veneer of respectability through the use of expressions such as “non-confidential” and “public feedback,” presenting the illusion that these processes will all be happening out in the open and with the direct involvement of the public, which couldn’t be further from the truth).

Not everything about the DSA is bad, however. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), for example,has praisedmany aspects of the regulation, including the protections it provides on user rights to privacy by prohibiting platforms from undertaking targeted advertising based on sensitive user information, such as sexual orientation or ethnicity. “More broadly, the DSA increases the transparency about the ads users see on their feeds as platforms must place a clear label on every ad, with information about the buyer of the ad and other details.” It also “reins in the powers of Big Tech” by forcing them to “comply with far-reaching obligations and responsibly tackle systemic risks and abuse on their platform.”

But the EFF says it also “gives waytoo much powerto government agencies to flag and remove potentially illegal content and to uncover data about anonymous speakers”:

Democracies are in many ways like the internet. In both cases, it may take a thousand cuts to demolish their foundation, yet each cut contributes significantly to their erosion. One such cut exists in the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the form of drastic and overbroad government enforcement powers.

The DSA is the culmination of a process that beganat leasta decade ago. Following the 2014 Maidan Square uprising, the US, NATO and the EU began attacking those who denounced it for what it was> a coup d’état. It was not long before the EU’s vast bureaucratic superstate was wheeled into place for a new propaganda war with Moscow.

At the start of 2015, Anne Applebaum (wife of the Polish ex-Minister for Defence, Radosław Sikorski, who famously thanked the US for the sabotage of the Nordstream pipelines), set up a unit within the Washington Center for European Policy Analysis called theInformation Warfare Initiative. Its founding mission was to counter Russian information in Central and Eastern Europe.

Months later, the European Council tasked the EU’s then chief diplomat, Federica Mogherini, with preparing a plan of “strategic communication” to denounce the Russian disinformation campaigns relating to Ukraine. The end result was theestablishmentof the EEAS Strategic Communication Division, whose functions include “leading the work on addressing foreign disinformation, information manipulation and interference” as well as “analys[ing] the information environment in order to enable EU foreign policy implementation and protect its values and interests.” That was in April 2015.

After 2016, the EU took its fight against disinformation to a whole new level following the triumph of Brexit and the election of Donald Trump. In June 2018, the Commission launched its Code of Practice on Disinformation, which was “voluntarily” signed by all of the major online social media platforms and search engines. In June 2022, almost exactly four years later, the Digital Services Act became law. Just over a year after that, on August 25, 2023, the deadline by which all VLOPs and VLSEs had to begin fully complying with the DSA passed. On that date, the EU’s Code of Practice on Disinformation lost its voluntary nature.

According to Jourová, Brussels is only interested in helping to establish the “facts”, not censoring people’s “opinions”:

But who gets to decide what actually constitutes mis- or disinformation for the EU’s roughly 450 million citizens (as well as arguably untold millions of citizens far beyond Europe’s borders)?

The European Commission.

That’s right, the EU’s scandal-tarnished, power-hungry executive branch whose top jobs, including that of its current president, Ursula von der Leyen, will be indirectly determined by the upcoming EU elections. It is the 705 Members of the European Parliament chosen by EU citizens this June who will ultimately have the final say on who fills the Commission’s roles.

The performance of the current Commission and Parliament is hardly what you would describe as vote-winning. The current Commission President Von der Leyen is under investigation onmultiple fronts, including by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, for her refusal to disclose the content of her whatsapp conversation with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla during pre-negotiations for up to 1.8 billion Pfizer-BioNtech COVID-19 vaccines. It was one of the biggest procurement contracts in EU history. VdL has also facedaccusationsof conflicts of interest over her husband’s role as scientific director at US biotech company Orgenesis, which received hundreds of millions of euros of EU subsidies on two separate occasions.

Von der Leyen now wants the Commission to take acentral rolecoordinating EU weapons procurement. She even cited her office’s success in procuring COVID-19 vaccines as a model to follow. Her Commission has also provided unbridled support to Israel while the IDF commits genocidal war against the people of Gaza. It has sabotaged the EU’s economic future through its endless backfiring sanctions on Russia while consistently putting US interests first. As economic conditions have deteriorated, the response from both the EU Commission and many member governments is almost always the same, as Conor Gallagherreported recently:

More wage suppressions, more market-friendly reforms, more social spending cuts, and more privatization. It was only a few months ago that the New York-based private equity firm KKR, which includes former CIA director David Petraeus as a partner, reached acontroversial agreementto buy the fixed-line network of Telecom Italia. Now the Italian dailyLa Repubblicais declaring that“Italy Is For Sale,”in which it describes plans for 20 billion euros worth of privatizations, including more of the state rail company Ferrovie dello Stato, Poste Italiane, Monte dei Paschi bank and energy giant Eni. The plan is reportedly necessitated by the country’s tax cuts. The roughly 100 billion euros Rome hasburned throughin order to address the energy crisis surely hasn’t helped either. And this was happening with the suspension of the EU debt brake.

In a recentop-edin Berliner Zeitung, a retired German judgedescribedthe DSA as a “trojan horse that presents a façade of respecting democratic principles@ while doing the exact opposite. He concludes that the EU’s mass censorship regime poses an “existential threat” to freedom of speech and the freedom of press, which are the corner stones of any genuine liberal democracy.:

The EU Commission sets the standard by which disinformation is judged. However, this means that politically unsavoury opinions, even scientifically argued positions, can be deleted, and not only that: if it is classified as unlawful, there are social consequences.

One inevitable result is that citizens begin self-censoring to align their messages on the platforms with what is currently acceptable within the corridors of power…. The cornerstone of any free society — the perpetual exchange of intellectual and political ideas, even with opposing opinions — will therefore crumble.

This is all happening at the same time that both the Commission and some EU national governments are pushing the bloc toward direct conflict with Russia whilecalling for the establishmentof an EU-wide war economy, all to be paid for no doubt by the EU’s hard-strapped citizens and businesses. All the while, Brussels is fast erecting its digital control system, first through the introduction of a bloc-wide digital identity program — which, like the digital vaccine passport system that preceded it, is being marketed as a purely voluntary scheme — followed some time later by a central bank digital currency.

The escalating war in Ukraine serves as a timely pretext for a brutal clampdown on basic democratic freedoms. But the EU would have probably reached this destination anyway, sooner or later. As a political project, the EU is fundamentally anti-democratic while its myriad failings have served as a convenient scapegoat to blame whenever national governments answerable to people have had to take unpopular decisions.

What Europe is now living through is an acceleration of a long-term trend, though this time the EU’s anti-democratic nature could have repercussions far beyond its own borders. Each crisis of this century has created a new opportunity for the Commission to tighten its grip while Europe itself grows weaker and weaker. As the veteran British journalist Peter Obourne onceput it,“By a hideous paradox the European Union, set up as a way of avoiding a return to fascism in the post-war epoch, has since mutated into a way of avoiding democracy itself.”

In fact, multinationals sheltered$1 trillionin profits in tax havens in 2022 alone. Many of these countries have corporate taxation rates of 0%, while others have rates falling around 5%. By comparison, the global average corporate tax rate stands at 23.5%.

The above graphic, fromPranav Gavali,via Visual Capitalist,shows where corporate taxation rates are the lowest as of 2023.

Below, we rank the countries with the lowest taxation rates for corporations, based on data from theTax Foundation. Countries with tax rates of 0% are not included:

Perhaps as no surprise, Barbados ranks top on the list, a tax haven where American corporations have transferred profits that exceed the country’s entire GDP.

Like the U.S., many big Canadian companies—from grocery giant Loblaws to Petro-Canada—shelter profits in the country thanks to a tax treaty signed in 1980. Overall, the Tax Justice Network estimates that$62 millionin profits are shifted into the country across global multinational companies annually.

With the lowest rate in the Middle East, UAE ranks fourth on the list. For the first time ever in 2023, the country increased its corporate tax rate from 0% to 9% to better align with the international push in raising corporate tax rates. This also allows the country to diversify revenues, which are heavily concentrated in theenergy sector.

Compared to 1980, tax rates have fallen across the board. We can see that in 1980, Hong Kong had the lowest rate, which stood at 17% to encourage business investment.

Overall,91%of countries across 225 jurisdictions have corporate tax rates under 30% today.

There appears to be an obsession with turning the UK’s national flags pink and purple.

Following the England football team having the St George’s Cross turned purple on their kit, the British Olympic team has now unveiled a pink and purple Union Jack flag, prompting many to ask what the hell is going on here.

The Telegraphreportsthat “Team GB have been slammed for ‘defacing’ the Union flag,” ahead of the Olympics in Paris.

Here is the ‘new’ Union Jack:

What is this new push about to 'transition' the UK and England flags into pink and purple? Report 👇🏻https://t.co/VOaRLArsDC

Malcolm Farrow, president of the National Flag Institute, told the newspaper “I don’t approve of our national symbol of unity being defaced.”

“People have every right to be upset with Team GB. They need to remember brave men fought for this flag and died while protecting it,” Farrow further urged.

He added that “Changing it is bordering on an insult to them. To do something like this in places like India, Greece or Turkey would have serious consequences.”

The company that designed the flag for the British Olympic Association claimed that it made it pink and purple because while “red, white and blue is synonymous with Great Britain,… it’s far from unique, with nations such as France and USA also sporting the same colours.”

What? So you took it upon yourselves to change the national flag?

“We needed to find a way of refreshing Team GB’s colour palette in a way that is both flexible and ownable,” branding company ‘Thisaway’ added, spouting more nonsense.

Many have pointed out that this direct upending of tradition is deliberate and that the colours pink and purple are being used to push a specific agenda.

Very transy.https://t.co/Mpb1PbB4MP

Don’t tell me that there isn’t an agenda !Team GB have now changed the Union Jack colours to again match the colours of many of the gender salad flags.Trolling?pic.twitter.com/TcNe6ZLY00

They know exactly what they are doing@Nike@fa@EnglandTrying to sneak that Woke, Gay communist nonsense onto the England national team jersey.It’ll be to appease all of the lesbians who play for the@Lionessesand in women’s football. Nothing ‘playful’ about it.Another…pic.twitter.com/Z4yF3Sv5TL

The real reason for Nike changing the England flag?pic.twitter.com/kWTm8Qm38b

WTF is this ⁦@TeamGB⁩ where is our flag, not this woke agenda nonsensehttps://t.co/vk9bqjbHfM

Last week when the England football team played in the kit with the purple flag, supporters made their feelings clear by becoming a red and white St George’s Cross.

That's what an England flag looks like, Nike! Fans display giant St George's Cross amid row over 'woke' kithttps://t.co/T3R53Pyqslpic.twitter.com/davBnlo5Yi

There’s more at play here. As we have highlighted, British and English people are being made to constantly feel they should be ashamed of their own flags, as if they aresome sort of hate symbols.

We didn't need a poll to reveal the frustrations of youngsters working two or three jobs just to afford rent, auto payments, and avocado and toast. The writing has been on the wall, especially on social media feeds of TikTok and X:

The struggle is real for the new generation, which is just now learning that working a 9-5 isn’t as easy as college.pic.twitter.com/FvAeYkTddt

A lot of people seem to think this mindset is unique to Gen Z. It’s not.Every generation goes through this. Watch Reality Bites, where a group of 20-somethings in the early 90s deal with the exact same struggles and emotions as described in this video.pic.twitter.com/7h1gAN3c7R

The Gen-Z girl who complained about the 9-5 work schedule has a comment for Business Insider (which tried to find out where she works) about the stress of finding a job as a post-grad. She's got a point.pic.twitter.com/4ExfWrELLF

Woman defends Gen-Z not wanting to work a 9-5 for the rest of their lives""I don't want to work my tail end off, wasting all of my life working, just to barely be able to pay my bills""pic.twitter.com/BxaTXjaxcd

The new Gallup poll of 18-29-year-olds validates the Biden administration, which seemingly cares more about illegal aliens and the LGBTQQIP2SAA community (not sure what all those letters mean), is quickly losing the young vote.

People in that age cohort are more than twice as likely to cite the economy as their top concern compared with older adults in recent Gallup data. And while all voters are more worried about the economy now than they were heading into the 2020 presidential election, the pessimism has spiked the most among those under 30. -Bloomberg

It's a wake-up call for the Biden administration. A recent Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll reveals a surprising trend: Former President Trump is leading President Biden 47% to 40% among voters 18-34 in swing states. This is a significant shift from the last presidential cycle when Biden won 61% of voters under 30.

The Biden administration understands they desperately need Gen-Z and millennial support to win in November. They are trying everything in their power to buy votes by bailing out youngsters with student debt (despite the Supreme Court ruling).

Youngsters are coming of age in one of the worst economic periods this nation has seen in a generation. Elevated inflation is crushing household finances.

With the election cycle well underway, there are mounting risks inflation could accelerate once again, and gas prices at the pump are rising.

Bidenomics has been a colossal failure, and young people are seeing that and are furious with the elderly, senile president who should be in a retirement home. Young people are beginning to understand they might never be able to afford the average American home as that dream died a long time ago. These frustrations are showing up in the polling data.

2024-04-03 06:30:00,Is Hungary A Model For The American Right?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240403112307/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/hungary-model-american-right,"Authored by Tamás Klein via The Mises Institute,

In recent years, my homeland, Hungary, a small country in central-eastern Europe, hascaptured the attentionof the American public, particularly those on thepolitical Right.Led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s government has championed a somewhat “Pat Buchanan” style of conservatism, with a strong emphasis on putting the interests of Hungarian families first and resisting supranational political powers,such as the federalist bureaucrats of the European Union, globalist nongovernmental organizations like the Open Society Foundation backed by George Soros, mass immigration, and other threats to its national sovereignty. Viktor Orbán’s unapologetic embrace of right-wing sovereigntism and noninterventionist foreign policy offers valuable lessons and points of inspiration for the American Right. However, like all states, Hungary is far from being a perfect model; thus, Americans should be cautious when trying to learn from it.

First, it is unfortunately necessary to address and dispel at least some of the most common smears perpetuated by leftists in mainstream Western media.Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, is often portrayed as a puppet of Russian president Vladimir Putin, a narrative that conveniently overlooks the geopolitical realities of the region. While Orbán does maintain good diplomatic relations with Russia—as do many other nations—insinuating that he is under Putin’s thumb is just as unfounded as was the Trump-Russia hoax.

The reality is that there is a historical minority of about one hundred twenty-five thousandHungariansliving in Transcarpathia, a territory that was unjustly taken away from Hungary after World War I and is currently being occupied by the Ukrainian regime. As any sober-thinking person would realize, Orbán is understandably making sure that the Russian artillery and Air Force do not target his people. Furthermore, Hungary has been dependent on Russian natural gas ever since the communist era, a fact Orbán has endeavored tochange. Orbán, being the leader of Hungary and not Ukraine nor the European Union, is first and foremost responsible for the well-being of his people and is completely in the right when refusing to satisfy the absurd demands of the Western Left in Washington and Brussels about completely cutting its diplomatic relationships with Russia.

Moreover, even though Orbán could have refused to take in refugees from Ukraine, a country that has beenterrorizingits Hungarian minority for decades, he decided toprovide refugefor the innocent civilians trying to flee this war.But, of course, almost no one in the West gave him credit for his actions. AsPaul Gottfriedrightlypointed out,

The media have said little about the world’s “largest democracy,” India, also buying energy from Russia and remaining conspicuously neutral in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. There is a good reason for that lack of indignation. Since India is predominantly non-Christian, lies outside the West, and has a relatively dark-skinned population, the media is not going to hold that country to the same PC standard as a non-woke Western state.

But Viktor Orbán, as the leader of a white Christian country, is, of course, held to different standards; but what is this double standard if not antiwhite racism?

Viktor Orbán’s success in winning elections through populism cannot be ignored. His ability to tap into the concerns and aspirations of ordinary people has been a driving force behind his political longevity. Moreover, after winning elections, he was able to institute meaningful reforms.

Since taking office in 2010, Orbán has quickly restored public order from the chaos that the social democrats created.He also instituted a more just and reasonableflat taxthan the previous “progressive” tax policy that punished success. Orbán’s government also passed anincome tax breakfor young people under twenty-five andtax reliefthat increases with the number of children raised by the family. Moreover, hebuilt a fenceon the southern border of the country to keep out the masses of invaders coming from the Middle East and Africa. Although receivingmassive international attacksfor doing so, Orbán has not shied away from confronting the agendas of powerful figures like George Soros, whose funding of leftist NGOs has been a toxic intrusion into Hungary’s domestic affairs. On the war question, Orbán consequently held a “Hungary first” position,advocating for peaceand staying out of the Ukraine-Russia conflict,not sendingsoldiers, weapons, or ammunition. Also, in the European Union parliament, Hungary has been a frequent solovetoagainst economic sanctions that hurt its people. Orbán alsobannedLGBTQ propaganda from schools, putting an end to the “drag queen story hour” before it even really began.

Orbán’s government has effectively grabbed power by recognizing the concerns of ordinary people and unapologetically pointing out who the enemies are: leftists, socialists, the bureaucrats of the European Union, Soros-backed nongovernmental organizations, warmongers, and more. Thus, by not being afraid to use his political power against the Left, Orbán was able to implement policies that have positioned him as a champion of national sovereignty.

While Hungary’s successes under Orbán cannot be understated, American right-wingers must proceed with caution before embracing it as a flawless model. Like any nation, Hungary has its share of challenges and imperfections, many of which are legacies of its communist past and the social democrats that came after it and before Orbán. Also, since Orbán must play by the rules of the game—that is, a democracy—he has to appeal to a population that grew up in socialism; thus, often, even though he most likely understands how some of his policies are detrimental to the economy, he has an election to win in order to make any reforms and thus has to embrace bad economic policies to please the Hungarian public. Nevertheless,high taxes, massive bureaucracies,inflation, economic regulations,price controls, subsidies, protectionist trade policies, and the promotion of green energy are all things that exist under Orbán and greatly hinder economic prosperity.

Moreover, the extreme regulations on gun ownership and the effective impossibility of obtaining permits to carry firearms for self-defense are not something that we, Hungarians, can be proud of either. Additionally, Orbán’s government sadly also passed a newPublic Education Lawthat extensively regulates private schools, effectively bans homeschooling, and makes kindergarten mandatory from age four.

In considering Hungary as a model, the American Right should recognize both its strengths and weaknesses. Orbán’s strategic approach to politics and his ability to enact meaningful policies that protect Hungary’s sovereignty and identity from global leftist hegemony offer valuable lessons. However, blindly adopting all aspects of Hungary’s governance would be shortsighted. Americans should be selective, taking inspiration from Orbán’s successes while remaining vigilant against policies that undermine liberty and prosperity.

Additionally, Hungary could benefit from observing the American Right, especially paleolibertarians, particularly in areas such as free-market economics, sound money, the importance of the right to bear arms, and the sovereignty of parents over their children’s education.By learning from each other, both Hungary and the American Right could greatly benefit. To ensure that both sides only learn from each other the good and not the bad, it is vital to keep in mind thewordsof Saint Basil the Great in his “Address to Young Men on the Right Use of Greek Literature.” In it, Saint Basil the Great of Caesarea gave guidance to the Christian youth about whether they should read literature from pagan sources, such as the great Greek philosophers. St. Basil instructed them to do so but with caution, only taking the good and leaving the bad:

Now, then, altogether after the manner of bees must we use these writings, for the bees do not visit all the flowers without discrimination, nor indeed do they seek to carry away entire those upon which they light, but rather, having taken so much as is adapted to their needs, they let the rest go. So we, if wise, shall take from heathen books whatever befits us and is allied to the truth, and shall pass over the rest. And just as in culling roses we avoid the thorns, from such writings as these we will gather everything useful, and guard against the noxious.

In conclusion, Hungary under Viktor Orbán presents a compelling case study for the American Right, showcasing the power of right-sovereigntist populism.However, it is essential to approach the Hungarian model with wisdom. The relationship between Hungary and the American Right should mirror the wisdom of Saint Basil’s counsel on using Greek literature. Just as bees selectively gather nectar from flowers, Americans should selectively adopt elements from Hungary’s model that align with its principles and goals while guarding against those that may be detrimental. And we, as Austrians and paleolibertarians, must be ready to point out when fellow right-wingers areabout to take“poison with honey.”By doing so, the American Right can continue advancing its vision for a better future, guided by wisdom and discernment.

Yes, we are well past the peak. As weexplainedin early March, ""Both the DEI and ESG gravy trains on Wall Street are finally coming to an unceremonious end.""

The unraveling of ""diversity, equity, and inclusion"" initiatives was seen on the state level, as Red states rushed to ban DEI programs in 2023. Google, Facebook, and other tech companies slashed DEI staff by late last year. Early this year, universities began rolling back diversity programs, while Harvard President Claudine Gay was demoted.

DEI was doomed to fail, and corporations have been quickly scrambling to abandon mindless and profitless diversity programs with Marxist roots. The latest earnings call data shows that ""DEI"" mentions have collapsed from their peak in 2021, according toAxios, citing data from AlphaSense.

In January, Johnny Taylor, president of the Society for Human Resource Management, told Axios that corporate executives are fed up with DEI.

""The backlash is real. And I mean, in ways that I've actually never seen it before,"" Taylor said, adding, ""CEOs are literally putting the brakes on this DE&I work that was running strong"" since George Floyd's murder in early 2020.

Kevin Clayton, senior vice president and head of social impact and equity for the Cleveland Cavaliers, said the chief diversity officer role was all the rage across corporate America after Floyd's murder. He said companies filled these positions ""out of gilt,"" and hiring wasn't the best.

Boeing has figured out this the hard way...

Axios noted, ""Some businesses are cutting back funding, trimming DEI staff — and even considering pulling back on things like employee resource groups comprised of workers of various races, ethnicities or interests.""

The pushback on DEI is finding momentum across corporations and universities. Subha Barry, former head of diversity at Merrill Lynch, told Bloomberg last month:""We're past the peak.""

""The seemingly small changes — lawyerly tweaks, executives call them — are starting to add up to something big: the end of a watershed era for diversity in the U.S. workplace, and the start of a new, uncertain one,"" per Bloomberg.

If it's DEI or ESG, the blowback phase is well underway. Companies are running away from these diverse and green programs because, simply, they don't make money.

2024-04-03 07:20:00,Rickards: Ukraine's Starting To Get Dangerous,https://web.archive.org/web/20240403112307/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/rickards-ukraines-starting-get-dangerous,"Authored by James Rickards via DailyReckoning.com,

A lot of people seem to have forgotten about the war in Ukraine. That’s a mistake.

Russia is slowly but steadily defeating Ukraine, which is becoming increasingly obvious to everyone except the most anti-Russian diehards.

That’s leading to desperation in elite Western circles determined to stop Russia one way or the other.In their minds, they simply can’t let Putin win. They think that if Putin wins in Ukraine, he’ll next move on to the Baltic states, Poland and elsewhere.

You know the West is getting desperate based on recent threats by France’s Emmanuel Macron to send troops to Ukraine.

The vice president of the Russia Duma, Pyotr Tolstoy (descendant of the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy), warned that French troops would be priority targets for Russian forces if they entered Ukraine.

Even though France would send troops independent of NATO, that puts us on a very dangerous path that ultimately leads to direct conflict between NATO and Russia. And that path ends in nuclear war ultimately.

Tolstoy added that it would take “just two minutes to nuke Paris.” It’s not hard to envision how quickly things could escalate if France decided to send troops to Ukraine.

Meanwhile, NATO is preparing to send F-16s to Ukraine. Airfields in Ukraine are highly vulnerable to Russian attack, especially since Ukraine’s air defenses are heavily depleted at this point and the Russian air force is becoming increasingly active in Ukraine.

But if NATO allows the F-16s to be based on its own airbases, Putin has warned that these airfields would become a “legitimate target” if strikes against Russian forces were launched from them.

By the way, Russia has hypersonic missiles that NATO has no practical ability to shoot down, so these attacks would likely be successful. Of course, NATO would have to retaliate in kind. You can imagine where all this could lead.

We’re already well along the escalation ladder.And the higher you go, the more face you stand to lose if you back down. I warned about that from the outset of the war.

But the entire notion that Russia poses some existential threat to NATO or Europe is absurd.

First off, the theory that Putin will invade other countries if he wins in Ukraine is nonsense. The Russian army lacks the men and materiel to occupy Ukraine while simultaneously invading other countries.

This isn’t the Soviet Union with its massive tank armies poised to roll over Western Europe. And Soviet communism is long dead, so there’s no ideological basis for Russia to invade Europe. These days Russia is a conservative, Orthodox Christian nation.

But more importantly, Putin has absolutely no incentive to invade any of these nations, which are NATO members. What do they have that he wants?

All it would do is trigger Article 5 of the NATO Charter, which stipulates that an attack on one member is an attack on all, inviting a massive NATO response. At that point, you’re on the fast track to nuclear war.

Putin is fully aware of that.

Fearmongers like to point to what Putin once said in a speech:

“Whoever doesn’t miss the Soviet Union doesn’t have a heart.”

They take that as proof that he wants to recreate the Soviet Union. But they conveniently omit what he said next:

“Whoever wants it back doesn’t have a brain.”

Whatever you think of Putin, he definitely has a brain. He has no intention to restore the Soviet Union.

But like any great power, Russia has interests, and Ukraine has always been a vital strategic interest to Russia.

And Russia is not going to tolerate Ukraine joining a NATO alliance that’s hostile to Russia.Critics say Ukraine is a free and independent nation that can join NATO if it wants. Russia has no say in the matter, even though Ukraine borders Russia.

Well, I guess they never heard of the Monroe Doctrine. The U.S. basically declared the entire Western hemisphere its own domain. But a great power like Russia can’t have a say in its own backyard?

Critics also say that the idea of NATO invading Russia is ridiculous. That’s just Russian paranoia. And that’s true, NATO isn’t going to actually invade Russia. But it’s not just intentions that count in the world of geopolitics. It’s also capabilities.

As Bismarck once noted:“What matters in politics is capabilities, not intentions. Intentions change, capabilities remain.”

Given Russia’s long history of being invaded, it’s not hard to imagine why it might seem a bit paranoid of exterior threats.

If you look at a map, parts of Ukraine are actually east of Moscow.

Of course, Ukraine can’t continue fighting without U.S. assistance. The Biden White House wants $60 billion of new money to give to Ukraine to fight the war. This is on top of several hundred billion already provided.

This was proposed last summer but has stalled in the Senate and House of Representatives ever since.The House passed a separate bill to aid Israel last fall, but the Senate refused to take it up because they want to tie that aid to money for Ukraine.

The Senate passed a bill that would provide aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan in one package combined with some money for phony border security.

That bill was so unpopular it could not even make it out of the Senate. Then the House insisted on passing regular appropriations before considering Ukraine.

That process was completed on March 23, but now Congress is on a two-week Easter recess so nothing further will happen until mid-April. No one has even answered the most important question, which is what would Ukraine do with the money.

They can’t buy badly needed 155mm artillery shells because the Western arsenals are bare and factories are not geared to make more than a handful. It will take years to expand that manufacturing capacity.

You can walk into a store with a wallet full of $100 bills, but if the shelves are empty, it doesn’t do you any good. The products simply aren’t there.

Meanwhile, wonder weapons from the West such as tanks, cruise missiles, armored personnel carriers, HIMARS precision-guided artillery and anti-missile batteries have all been destroyed, disabled or shot down by Russia.

The war in Ukraine hasn’t been good advertising for Western weapons.

To repeat what I said earlier, Ukraine is losing the war badly. Russia is advancing on the southern and eastern fronts in Ukraine.

Still, the pressure on House Speaker Mike Johnson to do something remains. The Republican warmongers in the Senate like Lindsey Graham and Joni Ernst won’t let up. Many Republicans in the House such as Chip Roy and Marjorie Taylor Greene are opposed to Johnson on this.

Incredibly, Johnson may respond to the pressure with a solution worse than an outright appropriation. He may get behind efforts to steal $300 billion in Russian central bank assets held in the form of U.S. Treasury securities.

That would destroy confidence in the U.S. dollar, U.S. Treasury securities and the U.S. rule of law. Russia would quickly recover the loss by seizing $300 billion or more of Western assets still in Russia. No one in Congress seems to understand any of this.

If they follow through, the economic fallout would be bad enough. But if this war doesn’t stop soon, we could ultimately be looking at nuclear fallout.

We the serfs on the techno-fiefdom that is the modern world can — at least in theory, at least for now — forego mRNA injections, even under threat of the loss of their livelihoods (although, apropos to the theme of this article, engineered mRNA is increasingly added to the food supply, eliminating informed consent).

As of now, most of the technocracy’s bioweapons disguised as medical therapies or technological conveniences can be avoided, albeit often at great personal expense and risk.

But everyone has to eat food, and everyone has to drink water.

And, unless you’re dredging your own well water and growing your own food to the extent of complete independence (and even then, there’s no protection against soil depletion or GMO franken-DNA blowing onto your property from a nearby operation), the food and water supply is a target-rich environment for depopulationist technocrats — and the corporations, NGOs, and governments in their back pockets — to exploit.

I got in the habit some years ago of actually reading — one might say (gasp!), doing my own verboten research as a non-credentialed peasant, which the “experts” warn sternly against — the ingredients list on products I was considering buying in the supermarket or wherever.

A rule of thumb, bit of wisdom passed down from where I can’t remember, is that if you can’t pronounce each of the ingredients, or if the list is longer than five items, it’s probably a good idea to take a pass.

ViaU.S. Right to Know(emphasis added):

“’Ultra-processed food’ describes food products that have been created or altered from their natural state with added sugars or artificial sweeteners, salt, additives, preservatives, or other chemicals. Added sweeteners in particular, includinghigh-fructose corn syrup,sucralose, andaspartame, are common in ultra-processed food.

They also often contain additives and preservatives, like food dyes (including Red 40, Yellow 5, andtitanium dioxide), sodium benzoate, sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite, brominated vegetable oil (BVO),potassium bromate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT).”

Nearly any processed food item you buy in the supermarket is likely to be chock-full of not one but dozens of these ingredients, a toxic slew of synthetic nonsense.

Continuing via U.S. Right to Know:

“Common ultra-processed groceries include cookies, sodas and energy drinks, fruit-flavored yogurts, margarine, packaged pastries, plant-based meats and milks, canned soups, frozen meals, sweetened breakfast cereals, granola and energy bars, hot dogs, deli meats, and potato chips.

Brands like Nestlé, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Unilever, Frito-Lay, Kraft Heinz, and Kellogg’sare among the world’s largest manufacturers of ultra-processed foods.”

Over time — and this comes as no surprise in the ultra-impatient world that demands convenience at all costs, saturated with agri-business advertising — consumption of ultra-processed food increases. Eventually, Soylent Green will be all that’s left on the menu.

ViaThe American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (AJCN)

“Adjusting for changes in population characteristics, the consumption of ultra-processed foods increased among all US adults from 2001-2002 to 2017-2018 (from 53.5 to 57.0 %kcal; P-trend < 0.001). The trend was consistent among all sociodemographic subgroups, except Hispanics, in stratified analyses.In contrast, the consumption of minimally processed foods decreased significantly over the study period(from 32.7 to 27.4 %kcal; P-trend < 0.001) and across all sociodemographic strata. The consumption of processed culinary ingredients increased from 3.9 to 5.4 %kcal (P-trend < 0.001), whereas the intake of processed foods remained stable at ∼10 %kcal throughout the study period (P-trend = 0.052).”

And here we arrive at the intersection of morbid obesity — a downright epidemic in the West if ever there one — and one of the worst offenders on the ultra-processed roster, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS).

“Obesity has increased dramatically in recent decades, a phenomenon widely associated with the so-called ‘western diet’: energy-dense, highly palatable foods with high fat and sugar content. More recently,there has been an interest in the possible contribution of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) to the rise in obesity. Used widely in nearly all commercial foods, from bread to beverages,HFCS consumption has risen in parallel with increasing body weights and rates of obesity. While evidence suggests links between increased sugar consumption and the rising prevalence of obesity and metabolic disorder,the contribution of HFCS per se, because of its higher fructose content, has been controversial with arguments for and against HFCS constituting a specific liabilitybeyond increased sugar consumption generally.

HFCS-55, containing 55% fructose, 42% glucose, and 3% other saccharides, is primarily used in liquid product.Fructose, including HFCS with its higher fructose content,is more lipogenic compared to other sugars and is metabolized differently. Where glucose can enter the cells through GLUT4 (various tissues), GLUT3 (neurons), GLUT2 (homeostasis though uptake in intestine), and GLUT1 (astrocytes and insulin-independent),fructose primarily uses GLUT5, which is not found in pancreatic beta cells, is specific for fructose, and not responsive to insulin. GLUT2 also transports fructose non-selectively, though this low-affinity transporter is involved in transport primarily in the liver, intestine and kidneys.”

ViaPharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior:

“Rats maintained on a diet rich in HFCS for 6 or 7 months show abnormal weight gain, increased circulating [triglycerides] and augmented fat deposition. All of these factors indicate obesity. Thus, over consumption of HFCS could very well be a major factor in the “obesity epidemic,” which correlates with the upsurge in the use of HFCS.”

And we’re just scraping the tip of the iceberg with HFCS.

What of Red 40, or aspartame, or brominated vegetable oil, or any of the others?

2024-04-03 17:50:00,David Einhorn: Besides GLD We Own A Lot Of Physical Gold,https://web.archive.org/web/20240404114725/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-03/david-einhorn-besides-gld-we-own-lot-physical-gold,"Following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC exclusive interview with Greenlight Capital Co-Founder & President David Einhorn on CNBC’s “Power Lunch” (M-F, 2PM-3PM ET) today, Wednesday, April 3. Check out Hedge Fund Alpha's coverage of the2024 Sohn New York Conference.

SCOTT WAPNER: Tyler, I appreciate it very much. It's good to see you, David. Thanks for being with us today.

DAVID EINHORN: Oh, it's a pleasure. Thanks for having me.

WAPNER: Your 20th Sohn presentation, I heard you say on the stage. You have been a loyal supporter of this event.

EINHORN: Yes, it's been a fantastic thing. It's a great cause. It gives money where it's really needed, initially with the pediatric hospital in New Jersey, and then later into research. And it's become like a New York institution within the community. And I feel just grateful every year to be invited to be part of it.

WAPNER: Yes, we're proud to be a part of it as well. So, your idea today was Solvay, a European chemicals company based in Belgium. We're going to see a move on the pink sheets here. Belgium market, obviously, in Europe, is closed now, so it's thinly traded as people look at it. How large of a position is that for you?

EINHORN: We own a little bit over 5 percent of the company.

WAPNER: OK. And what attracted you to that name specifically?

EINHORN: Well, we have a habit of looking at spinoffs. That's been a core investment strategy for us for many, many, many years. We have probably invested in 50 or 60 of them. And it's actually the highest-returning strategy we have within our portfolio. Our IRR on spinoffs is probably somewhere approaching 50 percent. And so we can identify only a few each year where we think they're really misunderstood, they're really misvalued. It's hard because there's large disclosure that people don't want to bother to read, and people often don't like it because they like the other part of the business. And so you get like a new shareholder base. And, sometimes, you just get a really attractive entry price.

WAPNER: You teased in your January investor letter a new long position, and you didn't reveal it then because you were still accumulating it. Is it different than what you revealed today?

EINHORN: No, that is the position.

WAPNER: That is the position.

EINHORN: It started trading...

WAPNER: So, we learn about it today.

EINHORN: That's right. This started trading in early December.

EINHORN: And we started buying it then. And then it had a little bit of a spike, and so we stopped buying it for a little while, and then we finished accumulating it. And we stopped buying a few weeks ago.

WAPNER: OK, so it's -- you said 5 percent. I mean, it's a top five position then for you.

WAPNER: Because that's what you suggested at the time that it was going to be.

EINHORN: That's right. It's a top five position.

WAPNER: Wow. How often are you looking to buy stocks in this current market?

EINHORN: All the time. I mean, I show up every day trying to figure out what stocks to buy. Most days, I'm not successful and I don't find anything that I want to buy. So it's really exciting when we do find some new opportunities.

WAPNER: I mean, you said on the stage that it's a great time to be a value investor. But, at the same time, you have a view about the value investing industry, which you suggest is dead. Can you elaborate on that?

EINHORN: Yes. The value investing industry and value investing are two completely different things. The value investing industry are my former peers that were paid money to manage money for other people, that spent their time researching stocks and trying to identify undervalued companies to buy. Many of them operated in long-only institutions, like mutual funds and stuff like that, and they used to be paid lots of money to identify these stocks. Well, with the shift to indexing, where trillions of dollars has been redeemed out of those strategies, those people have lost their jobs and they have lost their assets under management. So there's a lot fewer people right now looking to try to buy undervalued companies. So, for the few of us that are still doing it, it's kind of a unique time. It's a much better situation than it was when there was all of this competition before. That being said, you have to recognize how the environment has changed, how markets are functioning, and what it means to be a value investor, right? Value investing, this is the idea of buying things for less than they are worth. And, right now, because there's so little money that is actually pursuing strategies of trying to determine what things are worth and buying them for less than they're worth, there's many securities that are radically misvalued and undervalued. And you're able to identify just a few securities a year, such as Solvay, which is the new one that we're presenting today, that is so radically undervalued because there just isn't a professional industry trying to identify and purchase these things. So the opportunity comes to us, and we can buy a company of this quality with pretty much a double-digit dividend yield, while we wait for the business to improve its operations in the few years.

WAPNER: How have you adapted to this new environment that you articulate? I mean, some may have thrown in the towel, taken their ball and gone home and said, I'm -- like, I'm done. I have been doing this a long time. I don't need to do this anymore. You're obviously not one of them because you're still here looking for value stocks every day. But how have you adapted?

EINHORN: Right. It was very hard because we didn't realize what was happening for the first few years of this transition and we were doing what we were doing before and it just wasn't working. And I -- and we had some poor investment years of returns, until we eventually sorted this out. But around 2019, I think I kind of got a handle of what was actually going on in this dynamic. And what we can't do, see, is, if our business before was trying to figure out, like, what these long-only investors were going to buy six months or 12 months before they would, so if we could buy a company at 11 times earnings, and the earnings could be 15 percent more than people thought. And you would realize that the people -- that these long-only funds would realize this, they were on every call, they had analysts covering everything, and they're paying careful attention, so that, when things came out better than expected, not only would you get the return from the 15 percent growth in the earnings. You would get a rate -- a re-rating of the multiple as these institutions would come in and buy the stock. So our business fundamentally was figuring out what those people were going to do six months to a year before they figured out that they were going to do it, and then riding that along. Now, if those people don't have any money because they're all in passives and index funds and they're not paying attention, companies can announce better results, and nobody cares. So we can't buy things at 11 times, hope the earnings are 15 percent better, hope we get a 14 multiple at the end and make 50 or 60 percent over 18 months. That opportunity is not there. So we have to buy things even cheaper. So, the idea, like we have today, we're buying a stock right now that's below seven times earnings, and it's paying about a 10 percent dividend yield. So it doesn't matter if those other investors figure it out, because we're happy to just collect 10 percent, if that's all that we wind up doing.

WAPNER: You have declared the market is -- quote -- ""fundamentally broken."" That's sort of the terminology that you have used. Now, obviously you have adapted, as you said, well, because you're coming off of a really strong year. You're 22 percent net of fees, which I think followed one of the best years that Greenlight has ever had. So you have made the move, but you have also suggested to me that, because you think the markets are fundamentally broken, that means fewer companies are going public, right? That's one of the ideas that you have, these -- sort of this change has reverberated through the whole market structure.

EINHORN: Yes, absolutely. When I say that the market is broken, what I'm saying is, is, there's not enough money that is being dedicated to investing, trying to identify undervalued companies and reward companies and -- with new capital that have good opportunities for growth and to punish companies that don't have such good situations, because the professional industry of figuring this stuff out has largely been eradicated. And so the main problem that comes from that is, is, you just wind up where index funds or other strategies, they're going to buy whatever is the most overvalued thing, because they get the biggest weight in the index. So new money comes, and overvaluation becomes more overvalued, undervalued becomes even more undervalued, and values actually diverge from fair value, rather than come to fair value. But there's other ramifications of that. Once you have the largest shareholder in every major important company be a passive fund, shareholder activism becomes nearly impossible to improve corporate governance, because if you go to one of these index funds and you say, I have an idea for how this company could improve that will make the stock price go up, they just kind of look at you and go, well, we want all the stock prices to go up.They don't particularly -- and they don't have anybody on those proxy departments that even know how to value a company, let alone vote index shares in that kind of way. Another thing that's come, obviously, is, is the IPO market. The S&P is making highs, right? We're in a favorable economic environment, and yet where's the IPO market? Why aren't companies able to come public? And the reason is, is, companies used to do these things called road shows, and they would come to these managers, these long-only managers, and they would say, hi, I'm the mid-cap manager of the such-and-such fund. Would you like to buy my new stock? And if that person isn't there or they don't have any new money, there's no one to buy that stock. And so you have a closed IPO market, even in the face of really, really favorable market conditions otherwise.

WAPNER: I want to talk about some other positions that you have within the market, because one of them, frankly, surprised me when I read one of your letters, which suggested that you -- quote -- ""stayed committed to the turbulent regional banking industry,"" and you bought more New York Community Bank in the fourth quarter. So, I guess I sat back and said, wait a minute. Einhorn is supposed to be the guy who's saying, no, the regional banks are the ones with all the problems because of commercial real estate.

WAPNER: But then you buy New York Community Bank. Why?

EINHORN: Right. Our theory was, when they did the acquisition of the failed banks -- that happened roughly last March -- we bought all of the regional banks that were the purchasers of the failed banks because we thought that they would get really good discounts. And we did it several times, and all of them except New York Community Bank worked. But when New York Community Bank came out with their result and took their charge, we immediately just sold all of the stock, and we exited it, actually very small loss.

WAPNER: OK. So you're gone from those stocks. In terms of the market overall, you have spoken before about bubble baskets of names and names that have gone parabolic because of various trends that happened to be going on at that particular time. Now, obviously, the focus is on A.I. You made jokes about A.I. during your presentation today. Steve Cohen was on our network today, said, this is not like 1999, that there's no bubble in the market, AI is durable -- that's the word he used -- and would lead to greater productivity and efficiency. You agree with that? You think we're in a bubble? What's your view?

EINHORN: No, I don't particularly think we're in a bubble. We covered our bubble basket stocks in the first quarter of last year, and, right now, all of our shorts are idiosyncratic ideas based on situations with the particular companies that are involved. We don't have any basket short positions, right.

WAPNER: Interesting. You're still willing to short stocks too.

WAPNER: Because that's been a meaningful change in the industry too. Why?

EINHORN: We do. I think it adds a lot to our risk return profile. Shorting provides cash for you when the market goes down, because everything goes down and then you have new money to invest in other things. And I think we add value also by creating alpha on our shorts, shorting things that actually just go down.

WAPNER: I think I saw as well that you have a position in the GLD. Is that still current?

EINHORN: Yes, gold is a large...

WAPNER: Because you have talked about gold for many years. You were talking about gold before it was fashionable to be talking about gold, and now we are -- we keep going up with gold.

EINHORN: Yes. And we own a lot more gold than just the GLD. We own physical bars as well.

EINHORN: So, gold is a very large position for us.

WAPNER: Why have you made it so large?

EINHORN: Well, because I think that there's a con -- a problem with the overall monetary and fiscal policies of the country, and that both policies are systemically too loose. I think the deficits are ultimately a real problem, and I think that this is a way to hedge the risk of something not so good happening.

WAPNER: You think the chances are high of something good not happening?

EINHORN: Well, I think it's a question of when. And, when, we don't know. But in terms of the idea that the fiscal situation is not sustainable and the monetary policy is low in order to support the fiscal situation, I think these are self-evident, and it's clear to me that this is just a math thing, and so because -- knowing when this is, I don't know, because it's a reflexivity. As long as the market is confident in what's going on, everything is fine. But the minute that that changes, then -- then there's a real problem.

WAPNER: So, lastly, let's talk about rates real quick and what you think the Fed's going to do. How many times are they going to cut this year?

EINHORN: I think fewer than are priced in right now.

WAPNER: So, fewer than three?

WAPNER: Do you think they cut -- do you think there's a chance they don't do anything?

EINHORN: There's a chance. I think re -- inflation is re-accelerating. I think there's a lot of indication of that.

WAPNER: So you think there's a chance they could do nothing? You think there's a chance they hike?"
2024-04-03 21:20:00,How GPUs Are Disrupting High-Performance Computing,https://web.archive.org/web/20240404114725/https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/how-gpus-are-disrupting-high-performance-computing,"Graphics Processing Units, or GPUs, have moved beyond their original role of rendering video game graphics and are now used in a variety of high-performance computing applications (HPC), from AI training to zooplankton classification.

To help understand this pivot,Visual Capitalist teamed upwithHIVE Digitalto look at how GPUs differ from traditional CPUs and what gives them an edge.

CPUs, or Central Processing Units, and GPUs, generally have three main elements:

computeelements—technically ALU or arithmetic logic units—that perform calculations and carry out operations;

acontrolelement that coordinates the operations of the above; and

various levels ofmemory, including dynamic random access memory (DRAM), a kind of RAM or short-term memory used in the main memory of computers, and caches.

CPUs, or Central Processing Units, typically have one or more extremely powerful cores, made up of independent compute, control, and cache elements. A GPU, on the other hand, has many more less-powerful cores, each with multiple ALUs that share common cache and control elements.

The number of cores is important, especially when it comes to image processing. In order to display an image on your screen, the computer has to read, process, and display data for each pixel, which on modern high-definition displays can really add up. A 1,920 by 1,080 pixel display, for example, has2,073,600 pixels.

Unlike CPUs, which have to go one operation at a time, GPUs can handle multiple operations like this in parallel, thanks to its multiple-core architecture. Computer scientists call this method of data-handlingsingle instruction, multiple data (SIMD), but all we need to know is that this is why today’s computer games look so much better than 1972’sPong.

It turns out that GPUs can do more than just render graphics. Researchers are now using GPUs to model protein folding and sequence genomes, while cryptocurrency miners rely on them to validate transactions. GPUs are also playing a critical role in the field of AI, where trainingdatasetsare only getting larger.

GPUs are also working side-by-side with CPUs in the world’s only exa-scale computer,Frontier, which uses a combined8,699,904 GPU and CPU coresto achieve an impressive speed of 1.194 exa-flops per second.

But when you consider that CPUs are still built on roughly the samevon Neumannarchitecture from 1945, it’s perhaps no surprise that new specialized designs, like the GPU, are emerging to help us tackle some of the world’s toughest HPC challenges.

2024-04-03 22:00:00,From The Recycling Bin To The Landfill: The Major Flaw In Plastic Recycling,https://web.archive.org/web/20240404114725/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/recycling-bin-landfill-major-flaw-plastic-recycling,"Authored by Cara Michelle Miller via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

People may be putting plastic into recycling bins, but most of it generally ends up in landfills or incinerated.

Yet the demand for more plastic production continues—at a growing cost to human and environmental health—because of the belief that recycling offsets the associated waste and risks.A new report by the Center for Climate Integrity (CCI) alleges that the plastics industry knowingly caused the current plastic waste crisis.

Thenonprofit’s reportclaims that as the plastics industry faced mounting concerns over plastics being incinerated and piling up in landfills, they promoted recycling as a viable solution while dismissing it internally as impractical.

“They knew since the 1970s that plastic recycling was not going to be scalable and effective in tackling the plastic waste crisis,” Melissa Valliant, communications director of Beyond Plastics, a nonprofit aiming to reduce single-use plastic use and production, explained to The Epoch Times.

The report asserts that the efforts to sell the false promise of plastic recycling were to avoid restrictive regulations and potential product bans.

According to the report, one problem with plastic recycling is that it is not technically or economically feasible at scale. Unlike glass and metal, plastic cannot be repeatedly recycled without quickly degrading in quality. Most recyclable plastics can typically only be recycled once. As a result, most recycled plastic eventually ends up in landfills, even if it goes through an additional use cycle as another product.

Between the 1970s and 2015, 91 percent of plastic was either landfilled, burned, or leaked into the environment,according to a global analysispublished in Science Advances. Anotherrecent reportpublished by Beyond Plastics estimated that less than 6 percent of plastic in the United States is successfully recycled.

These figures are based on all plastic waste generated, which includes plastics not made to be recycled and those thrown away. As for the plastic that makes it to a recycling center, there isn’t an official nationwide estimate of what percent of those plastics get recycled in the end.

However, certain types of plastic containers—soda and water bottles (PET 1) and milk jugs (HDPE 2), in particular—aremore likely to be recycled.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), aninternational organizationfocused on improving public policies, says only 9 percent of plastic collected for recycling worldwide in 2019 was actually recycled; 50 percent went into landfills, and 22 percent was mismanaged.

Another challenge is that there are too many different types of plastics. Recyclable plastics cannot be recycled with plastics made of different chemical compositions, and sorting the waste is infeasible.

The plastics industry’s actions “effectively protected and expanded plastic markets,” the CCI report states, “while stalling legislative or regulatory action that would meaningfully address plastic waste and pollution.”

The report, highlighting industry communications and documents, details how, beginning in the 1950s,the plastics industry’s profits soared with single-use disposable plastics, and this “shift to disposables” created the waste problem.

In response, the industry promoted landfilling and incineration. However, by the 1980s, the plastics industry faced growing backlash and legislation to limit the sale of single-use plastics because of pollution and its environmental impact.

The industry “launched multimillion-dollar ad and PR campaigns to convince the public consumer that this was a consumer problem; just put the right things in the bin, and all the plastic pollution would go away,” said Ms. Valliant.

Plasticproduction then skyrocketed, from approximately 2 million tons of plastic in the 1950s to nearly 460 million tons in 2019, and continues to rise.

The CCI report cites a 1986 report by Vinyl Institute, a trade association, that “recycling cannot be considered a permanent solid waste solution [to plastics], as it merely prolongs the time until an item is disposed of.”

Eight years later, an Exxon employee warned the American Plastics Council staffers thatthey did not “want paper floating around”saying they could not meet recycling goals since the issue was “HIGHLY SENSITIVE POLITICALLY.”

The report’s authors aim to hold fossil fuel and other petrochemical companies accountable by pointing out that these admissions contradict decades of messaging promoting recycling.

Twenty petrochemical companies, including major oil and gas companies such as ExxonMobil, manufacture half of the world’s single-use plastics, according to the CCI.

In response to the CCI report,the Plastics Industry Association characterized the report as “political attacks”and that it is based on “outdated information and false claims.”

“This report was created by an activist, anti-recycling organization and disregards the incredible investments in recycling technologies made by our industry,” Matt Seaholm, president and chief executive officer of the Plastics Industry Association, said inthe press statement.

Similarly, in a statement published by theAmerican Chemistry Council(ACC), Ross Eisenberg, the president of America’s Plastic Makers, called the report flawed, saying it “cites outdated, decades-old technologies, and works against our goals to be more sustainable by mischaracterizing the industry and the state of today’s recycling technologies.” He also pointed to the benefits of plastics and how they can be reused to meet different needs.

“We’ve set an ambitious goal for all US plastic packaging to be reused, recycled, recovered by 2040, and we are working towards this goal by supporting systems and technologies that remake new plastics from used plastics,” he shared.

But many wonder: Even if the ACC’s 2040 goal is met, does it solve the wide-rangingissues linked to plastics?

“Possibly more concerning than the environmental impacts are the health impacts of plastics on the human body,” said Ms. Valliant, who recommends consumers focus on efforts to reduce, reuse, recycle, and, when possible, refuse single-use plastic.

The management of plastics “needs to be addressed at a higher level than the individual,” Mathew Campen, a toxicologist from the University of New Mexico, told The Epoch Times.

When plastic is recycled improperly, it ends up not only in landfills and water sources but also in our soil, air, andeven our bodies. Every day, we eat, drink, and inhale tiny bits of plastic because plastic doesn’t biodegrade over time—it simply breaks down into ever-smaller particles.

Mr. Campen, who investigates the impact of environmental toxicants on human health, is concerned about the increasing amount of plastics, specifically microplastics, in the environment and the potential effects.

“The truth is,governments and industry need to figure out a path to actually take care of this waste and not have it show up in our bodies,” he added.

2024-04-03 22:20:00,Wife Of Judge In Trump 'Hush Money' Trial Worked For AG Letitia James,https://web.archive.org/web/20240404114725/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/wife-judge-trump-hush-money-trial-worked-ag-letitia-james#comment-stream,"Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Lara Merchan, the wife of the judge presiding over former President Donald Trump’s “hush money” case in Manhattan, once worked for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the massive $350 million civil fraud case against the former president, with the revelation reviving claims of bias and calls for the judge’s recusal.

Records reviewed by The Epoch Times show that Ms.Merchan worked for 21 years as a Special Assistant to the AG in New York, including three years under Ms. James. She changed jobs over two years ago.

Ms. James is a Democratwho fixatedon President Trump as she campaigned for New York attorney general, calling him a “con man” and vowing to shine a “bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings.”

She began investigating the former president soon after taking office, eventually suing him for allegedly misleading banks and others about the value of his assets.

Ms. James eventually won the case on Feb. 16, with New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron ordering President Trump and Trump Organization executives to pay $350 million in damages, and barring the former president from doing business in the state for three years.

Judge Juan Merchan is presiding over a separate criminal trial involving President Trump in New York, in which the former president is accused of falsifying business records in order to conceal a $130,000 “hush money” payoff to an adult performer to stay quiet about their alleged affair.

President Trump on his Truth Social platformaccused Judge Merchanof bias and corruption, while labeling the case against him “election interference” and alsodemandingthe judge’s recusal.

The former president has also alleged that the judge’s daughter, Loren Merchan, has a partisan interest in the case because she leads a political marketing firm and has represented President Trump’s political opponents, receiving millions from them.

Judge Merchan imposed a gag order against President Trump in the case and, on April 1, expanded it to include family members of the judge and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.

The judge wrote in the order that PresidentTrump’s speech “injects fear in those assigned or called to participate in the proceedings that not only they, but their family members as well, as ‘fair game’ for Defendant’s vitriol.”

Laura Loomer, an independent journalist and popular conservative commentator who on social media shared records that Judge Merchan’s wife worked for Ms. James, wrote in apost on Xthat this fact represents “another major conflict of interest!”

Various conservative accounts reacted to Ms. Loomer’s post, arguing that the revelation adds to evidence that the judge should recuse himself from the case.

“And this is why they expanded the gag order on Trump,” Paul A. Szypula, a popular conservative commentator on X with over 140,000 followers,said in a post. “It’s even more obvious how biased Judge Merchan is. He has to recuse himself now. There’s clearly at least an appearance of a conflict here. That’s enough in itself.”

Another popular account with over 46,000 followers called “The doppelgängers”argued in a postthat, “everyone knows this is all connected and they are all connected to same sources to take down Trump.”

By contrast, Brian Krassenstein, a left-wing political commentator with a similar size following on X, pushed back on Ms. Loomer, saying the fact Judge Merchan’s wife once worked for Ms. James is not evidence of bias or conflict of interest.

“The New York State Attorney General’s office employs more than 700 Assistant Attorneys General. It’s not as if she was Letitia James’ right-hand woman,” he wrote in apost on X. “Literally 40% of all of the staff working in the Office of the AG in NY are ‘Special Assistants.’”

“Loomer is trying to somehow say that since the Judge in Trump’s Manhattan case was or is married to a woman who once worked in an office with 700 other people under the AG, who already won a civil suit against Trump, that Judge Merchan now has a conflict of interest,” he continued.

Further, Mr. Krassenstein suggested that Ms. Loomer, who is a vocal Trump supporter, may even have posted about the judge’s wife at his direction.

“If so that would likely be illegal now that a gag order is in place,” Mr. Krassenstein said.

Lara Merchan was not immediately reachable for comment.

Judge Merchan has already declined to recuse himself from the case.

In the case, Mr. BraggchargedPresident Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records, alleging a scheme to influence the 2016 election with payments meant to bury unfavorable news coverage of the alleged affair with the adult performer, which the former president has denied.

The trial has been set for April 15, and in less than two weeks, the first-ever criminal trial of a former American president will take place in Manhattan.

2024-04-03 23:00:00,4 More Christians Found Guilty Over Prayer Gathering At Nashville Abortion Clinic,https://web.archive.org/web/20240404114725/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/4-more-christians-found-guilty-over-prayer-gathering-nashville-abortion-clinic#comment-stream,"Authored by Beth Brelje via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

It is likely that the Department of Justice (DOJ) will be throwing an elderly survivor of a communist concentration camp in federal prison for sitting in a wheelchair in the hallway of an abortion business and singing church hymns.

A bench trial at the Fred Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville this past week lasted just one day.

By the end of it on April 2, four Christians were convicted of a misdemeanor FACE Law violation. The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) law prohibits anyone from obstructing, intimidating, or interfering with a woman seeking an abortion.

They had been charged after singing hymns, praying, and persuading women not to abort their babies on March 5, 2021, at the now-defunct Carafem Health Center in Mount Juliet, Tennessee. The DOJ characterized the action as an illegal “blockade.”

The abortion business closed after a change in Tennessee law, prohibiting abortion in most cases.It means the defendants are guilty of trying to stop what is now effectively outlawed in that state.

The four found guilty are Eva Zastrow, 25, of Michigan; James Zastrow, 27, of Missouri; Paul Place, 26, of Tennessee, and Eva Edl, 89, of South Carolina, who was in a wheelchair on the day of the incident.

Each faces up to a year in prison.They remain free until their July sentencing. But Eva Zastrow and Eva Edl have multiple FACE charges. They will go to a Michigan court in August, where each could get up to an additional 11 years in prison on a more aggressive FACE charge.

In January, six other defendants were found guilty of FACE and felony conspiracy (for social media posts showing what they were doing) for the same Tennessee incident. Each of the six could get up to 11 years in prison at their July sentencing. More people are headed to trial for the same action.

After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, President Biden formed the Reproductive Rights Task Force, a DOJ-led group that has increased enforcement of the FACE Law.

Ms. Edl has been a long-time, peaceful activist at abortion clinics, motivated by her traumatic childhood in communist Yugoslavia. She was removed from her home with her family. They were allowed to keep only a dish and the clothing they wore.

She recalls being stuffed into a cattle car and shipped to a camp where she nearly starved to death, while she watched the people around her die. As a child, she watched the dead being put on wagons and then be buried in mass graves.

“We were considered to be non-human, with just permission given for torturing and killing us by the government,” Edl told an interviewer with WJBF television in 2018.

Our government’s legalizing abortion does not make it right or good, Edl told The Epoch Times in a 2023 interview.

“If it is right for the American government to legalize the killing of innocent human beings inside the womb, preborn babies, then why do we condemn the Nazis who also legalized the extermination of born people—Jews, Gypsies, and others—all unwanted individuals,” Edl said.

“If it is a good thing to kill human beings just as long as the government says so, then we have no right to condemn anybody else. But we all know deep down that these things are evil.”

“Nobody’s life is ultimately safe in a nation ruled by someone who does not respect all human life, from conception to natural death,“she continued. ”It will just depend on who is in power, and whose whim will dictate who is permitted to live, and who is going to be exterminated.”

She called compared abortion businesses to death camps.

“When I was on the cattle car with all my people, and we were shipped to the death camp to be exterminated, the people around us were not in agreement with what the government did. But they were intimidated,” Edl said.

“We have to overcome that fear and do what is right anyhow. … I wished in those days that somebody would have cared enough to go stand on those railroad tracks and say, ‘You cannot take these babies and children unless you go over our dead bodies.’

“If more and more would just lay down their lives and be willing to at least go to jail to protect these babies, we would have more success. But then, who knows what the Lord will do. Maybe he will honor even the sacrifice of the few. I’m always hopeful.”

Almost 200,000 people are thought to have been displaced in 2023, and several thousand since the beginning of 2024.

Thousands of Haitians continue to flee to the neighboring Dominican Republic, with theHaitian-Dominican border currently in a state of major crisis.

Relations between Haiti and theDominican Republic, which share the island of Hispaniola, have long been complex.

While the economies of the two countries were comparable in the mid-20th century, the Dominican economy gradually improved over the subsequent decades.

The Republic of Haiti, long plagued by political instability, has seen its economy deteriorate.

Andas Statista's Martin Armstrong details below, whileHaiti is currently the poorest countryin the Western Hemisphere, the situation isradically different in the Dominican Republic.

You will find more infographics atStatista

Nearly 6 out of 10 Haitians (58.7 percent) live on less than $3.70 a day, while only 4% of Dominicans are in this state of poverty.

GDP per capita is also almost six times higher in the Dominican Republic than in Haiti.

These differences are also reflected in the life expectancy of each country- Haiti has an average life expectancy at birth of 63 years, while in the Dominican Republic it stands at 73 years.

2024-04-03 23:40:00,The Great Escape From Government Schools,https://web.archive.org/web/20240404114725/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/jim-bovard-great-escape-government-schools,"Authored by Jim Bovard via The Libertarian Institute,

After enduring bullshit school shutdowns during the COVID pandemic, many students concluded that school itself must be bullshit and have skipped attending classes.Government bureaucrats are panicking since subsidies are tied to the number of students’ butts in chairs each day. Duke University Professor Katie Rosanbalm lamented that,thanks to the pandemic, ""Our relationship with school became optional.""

School absences have ""exploded"" almost everywhere, according to aNew York Timesreport last week.Chronic absenteeism has almost doubled amongst public school students, rising from 15% pre-pandemic to 26% currently. Compulsory attendance laws are getting trampled far and wide.

The New York Timessuggested that “something fundamental has shifted in American childhood and the culture of school, in ways that may be long lasting.” Connecticut Education Commissioner Charlene M. Russell-Tucker commented,“There is a sense of: ‘If I don’t show up, would people even miss the fact that I’m not there?'”The arbitrary, counterproductive school shutdowns destroyed the trust that many families had in the government education system.

The New York Timesreflected the tizzy afflicting education bureaucrats across the land: “Students can’t learn if they aren’t in school.”

So kids are not enduring daily indoctrination to doubt their own genders? So kids’ heads are not being dunked into the latest social justice buckets of fear, loathing, and guilt?So kids are not being drilled with faulty methods of learning mathematics to satisfy the latest Common Core catechism and vainly try to close the “achievement gap”? A shortage of indoctrination is not the same as a shortfall of education.

More than seventy years ago, University of Chicago President Robert Hutchins aptly observed,“The tremendous waste of time in the American education system must result from the fact that there is so much time to waste.”John Taylor Gatto, New York’s Teacher of the Year of 1991 (according to the New York State Education Department), observed, “Government schooling…kills the family by monopolizing the best times of childhood and by teaching disrespect for home and parents.”

My view on school absenteeism is shaped by my dissident tendencies. Government schooling was the most brain deadening experience in my life. Early in elementary school, I relished reading even more than peanut butter.But I was obliged to put down books and listen to teachers, slowing my mental intake by 80% or 90%. By the time I reached fourth grade, my curiosity was fading.

Between my junior and senior years in high school, I lazed away a summer on the payroll of the Virginia Highway Department.I came to recognize that public schools were permeated by the same “Highway Department ethos.”Teachers leaned on badly-written textbooks instead of shovels. Going through the motions and staying awake until quitting time was all that mattered. Learning became equated with drudgery and submission to bored taskmasters with chalk and erasers.

And then came the wooden stakes hammered home in English classes. Devoting two months to dissectingHamletmade me damn all Danes, courtiers, and psychoanalysts. The week spent on Mark Twain’s “The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County” story made me lust to cast all frogs and folksy nineteenth century authors into hell. The six weeks blighted byParadise Lostconvinced me Samuel Johnson was right: “None ever wished it longer than it is.” Old books, rather than sources of wisdom and inspiration, were mental castor oil—something to forcibly imbibe solely to emit the right answers on the exams.

I spent years mentally idling while teachers droned.As long as the government provided a seat in a classroom, it had fulfilled its obligations. There was never any inkling that later in life, I would need to mobilize every iota of talent I might possess. My brain was like the mythical village of Brigadoon. It showed up once every year or two to take a scholastic aptitude test and then vanished into the mists. Teachers chronically noted on my permanent record “not performing up to potential.” Mysteries never cease. As long as I didn’t fail a grade, I slipped under the radar.

I was never a chronic truant until my family moved to a college town just before the start of my senior year in high school. I missed practically as many classes as I attended that year, scampering over to the nearby Virginia Tech campus. I scrupulously avoided going to a notorious bar—only two blocks away—during school hours. Actually, this was more expediency than principle, since the happy hour with 10-cent beer didn’t commence until after the last class finished.

After my class absences reached a certain threshold, I was sent to the school counselor—a  perfectly coifed 30ish guy with an air of rectitude thick enough to cut with a knife.

He asked why I was skipping out, and I said school was mostly bunk. If I could pass classes without enduring Chinese-water-torture monotony, why stick around?

The counselor declared my attitude unacceptable and urged me to “get involved with the student government to try to fix things.” So I should fizzle away my time propping up the equivalent of the Vichy regime in Nazi-occupied France?!? Paul McCartney’s “Band on the Run” line, “Stuck inside these four walls, sent inside forever,” echoed in my head. When misbehaving kids were compelled to stay after school, it was called “detention.” But the entire system was detention, especially for the final year or two.

Our stupid COVID policies are going to create the largest policy induced cause of wealth disparity in World history.https://t.co/HR2PNlscRl

Boredom vanished from my life almost completely on the day I graduated from high school. My mental vitality surged after I no longer lost the bulk of my days fulfilling “seat time” requirements.Week by week, I began to regain the love of reading that I had lost years earlier.  That made all the difference for my life and writing.

I recognize that many (if not most) of the new chronically absent students are probably putting their free time to good use. But at least teenagers have the chance to discover new books and to awaken their minds in a way that would never occur locked in classrooms. One epiphany is worth a dozen regurgitated exams.

Maybe if politicians ceased treating kids’ minds like disposable resources, more young folks would voluntarily show up for school.But generations of young kids have been sacrificed for whatever fad sweeps political and education activists. The best solution is to enable as many children as possible to exit government schools as soon as possible.

2024-04-04 02:00:00,Reuters Has Ulterior Motives For Reporting That Iran Tipped Russia Off Before The Crocus Attack,https://web.archive.org/web/20240404114725/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/reuters-has-ulterior-motives-reporting-iran-tipped-russia-crocus-attack#comment-stream,"Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

This narrative is being pushed to deflect from the evidence tying Ukraine to the Crocus terrorist attack and to discredit the Russian security services...

Reuterscited three unnamed sources to exclusively report on Monday that Iran had allegedly tipped Russiaoff about a then-impending major terrorist attack after learning about it from ethnic Tajik ISIS-K terrorists who were detained after the group’s early January attack in Kerman. The information lacked specific details, but the outlet editorialized that “It is harder…for Russia to dismiss intelligence from diplomatic ally Iran on the attack” than from the West, the latter of which they claim that it downplayed.

Accordingly, Reuters wrote that this “raised questions over the effectiveness of Russian security services”,thus exposing the ulterior motive behind this report. The West has done all that it can to deflect from Russia’s accusations thatUkraine was tied to this terrorist attackvia the evidence that its investigation has uncovered. This includesclaimingthat the vague warning that the US passed along to Russia was obtained from spying on ISIS-K, not on Kiev like this analysisherecompellingly argues.

By including an Iranian dimension into the emerging narrative of early warnings ahead of theCrocus terrorist attack,the West via Reuters wants to further deflect from its own and Ukraine’s involvement in what happened while simultaneously discrediting the Russian security services.This analysisheredebunks the false narrative that President Putin downplayed ISIS-K threats in the run-up to the attack, yet the West is doubling down on that claim, largely in response to evidence implicating Kiev.

To be sure, there’s a chance that one or some of those ethnic Tajik ISIS-K terrorists that Iran detained in January might have heard about the group’s plans to attack Russia, but that’s altogether different than them having knowledge of the then-impending Crocus plot. Russia already knows that it’s in that group’s crosshairs after theybombed its embassy in Kabulin September 2022. Without specific information, whether from Iran or anyone else, nothing on the home front would have changed in response to that.

For instance, Russia, the UK, or even a random social media person could vaguely claim that ISIS-K is planning to attack the US, which American officials themselves are already aware of but wouldn’t do anything differently on the home front upon being informed of the latest rumors. Likewise, it’s unrealistic to imagine that Russia would ramp up security at all large gatherings even if Iran told them that a detained ethnic Tajik ISIS-K terrorist might have claimed that the group is planning to attack it.

For what it’s worth,RTquoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that “I do not know anything about this” when asked about Reuters’ report, so objective observers should be skeptical of it. He either wasn’t informed ahead of his media briefing that such vague information was allegedly passed along to Russia by Iran or it simply didn’t happen. It doesn’t matter which of these two is true though since it wouldn’t have made a difference either way for the reasons that were explained.

Promoting this unverified report from anonymous sources quoted by Western media is therefore only being done for the ulterior motives of deflecting from the evidence tying Ukraine to the Crocus terrorist attack and discrediting the Russian security services.Considering the driving force behind this latest report, it can be expected that more such stories might soon follow, and everyone should be equally skeptical of them as well while keeping in mind the narrative goals that they aim to advance.

The EU country is also among those demanding answers for the drone strikes that killed a group of World Central Kitchen aid workers this week. ""I expect and demand that the Israeli government clarify as soon as possible the circumstances of this brutal attack that has taken the lives of seven aid workers who were doing nothing but helping,"" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a fresh statement.

But Prime Minister Sanchez is also driving global headlines for his Tuesday statements declaring the Spanish government is moving forward withrecognizing Palestinian statehood. TheFinancial Timesreportedthat the country is ready to bestow formal recognition as early as July.

Sanchez said,""We have to seriously consider doing it in the first half of this year.""The declaration he made while on a Middle East tour is sure to rile Israeli leadership, which has condemned efforts to force recognition of a Palestinian state at a moment the Israeli military is in a fight with Hamas terrorists.

According to more details viaregional media:

State news agency EFE and newspapers El Pais and La Vanguardia cited Sanchez as making the informal remarks to the traveling press corps late on Monday in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on the first day of visits to Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

According to the reports,Sanchez said he expected events to unfold in the conflict ahead of the European Parliament elections in early Juneand highlighted ongoing debates at the United Nations.

Of course, Spain wouldn't be the first to unilaterally recognize Palestine (outside of a broader UN move, for example). Those EU states to have previously done soincludePoland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. Ireland and Malta have also recently said they are on board and plan to do so.

However, the UK, France, and Germany have expressed they will not recognize Palestine outside of a broader deal for a two-state solution that involves Israeli assent.

Spain and those European countries which have already made declarations of recognition want to see the Palestinian Authority (PA) take control of Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state.

Various two-state solution plans have been proposed over the past decades, but have never taken shape...

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, has vowed to block all of these efforts - and indeed the scenario would remain impossible without Israeli agreement, given IDF troops currently occupy all of these places.

As predicted, Police Scotland was deluged with nearly 4,000 complaints in the first day alone after the passage of an absurd new hate crime law, proving the legislation is being weaponized by activists.

Under the new legislation, anyone deemed to have been verbally ‘abusive’, in person or online, to a transgender person, including “insulting” them could be hit with a prison sentence of up to seven years.

Transgender activists have been busy making lists of people they are waiting on to make such comments, including Harry Potter author JK Rowling herself.

Although it was announced yesterday by police that Rowling wouldn’t be investigated, the mere fact that she has been reported could create a ‘hate incident’ file on her that will remain in perpetuity.

“Calum Steele, the former general secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, said he understood that around 3,800 cases had been lodged over the previous 24 hours,” reportsthe Telegraph.

That figure is likely to now be almost doubled as deranged shitlibs feverishly report anything they deem offensive via an online form and a 101 non-emergency number.

Authorities are now being swamped with vexatious complaints exactly as the legislation’s critics predicted, with resources that would have been available to tackle real crime directed elsewhere to patrol speech.

Indeed, as we previouslyhighlighted, Police Scotland admitted that the new law could create “additional demand”and create a “resource implication” for police.

This followed a trial of a separate program set to be implemented across the country to stop investigating crimes like theft and criminal damage, which authorities acknowledge will help criminals.

When it was put to her that she wasn’t at risk due to her profile, Rowling responded that she would defend anyone who was targeted.

If they go after any woman for simply calling a man a man, I'll repeat that woman's words and they can charge us both at once.pic.twitter.com/s9OcsgHr5j

“If they go after any woman for simply calling a man a man, I’ll repeat that woman’s words and they can charge us both at once,” said the author.

As wehighlightedyesterday, odious Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf, who seemingly has a problem with there being a lot of white people in Scotland, ludicrously asserted the law was needed because some offensive graffiti was discovered near his home.

2024-04-04 04:14:49,Picking Up Pennies In Front Of A Steamroller,https://web.archive.org/web/20240404114725/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-04/picking-pennies-front-steamroller,"Famed short seller Jim Chanos noted on X recently that more investing accounts were pitching the ""free money"" to be made from selling naked options.

Speaking of selling options, I am seeing a lot more of these kinds of “free money” posts on my feed lately. As they used to say on the floor of the CBOE in the 80’s, “It’s time for a new class picture!”https://t.co/M0xcG9AoJr

It seems that some young traders don't remember back to 2018, when James Cordier posted his infamous apology video after losing nearly all of his clients' money with this strategy.

X user ""@jaredhstocks"" had an excellent thread earlier this week detailing how James Cordier blew up his fund, and tying that back to the current trend of selling penny puts on the SPX complex that Chanos mentioned above.

@Falba12Hi! here is your unroll:https://t.co/vZBAN5lu5mEnjoy :) 🤖

8/ So how does the Optionseller story relate to$SPX“penny puts”? Well, as of late, we have seen a dramatic uptick in funds selling DOTM puts for 0.05 a piece like this example below. Why might they do this? Low correlations in a low volatility envrironement. The maximum profit is actually quite limited for the amount of risk they are taking on (Sharpe Ratio). Someone who is at the forefront of understanding this toxic flow is [volatility trader Kris Sidial]. He notes that tail selling is “making a comeback today in larger size than the last 10 years,” and desks are “jumping over one another” to sell these penny options.

2024 has no limit of geopolitical risks in the marketplace. Likewise, the record breaking interest in systematic vol selling programs imbeds further market risk if the trade were to be unwound and I’m not talking about call overwriting strategies. I’m referring to the elevates interest in selling the most toxic and convex parts of the distribution. While it’s to be foreseen what the catalyst will be,If a systematically shocking news event hits the tape over the weekend when participants can’t manage their trade, I fear what happened to James will happen to those selling these penny puts.

A smarter way to trade options is to make sure your risk is well-defined at the outset. Here's a recent trade of ours that illustrates that, a bet against the bitcoin hoarder MicroStrategy (MSTR).

Even Saylor is selling$MSTRat these prices.pic.twitter.com/nslYKfXBRv

Our trade there was a vertical spread expiring on June 21st, buying the $1,500 strike calls on MSTR and selling the $1,490 strike calls for a net credit of $5. Since one options contract covers one hundred shares, you would collect a net credit of $500 on one contract on this trade is MSTR is below $1,490 per share on June 21st. The worst case scenario for you here would be MSTR trading above $1,500 on that date, in which case, you would lose $500, but no more than that. The break even here is with MSTR trading above $1,495. Between that and $1,500, you would make a gain of less than $500, and between that and $1.490, you would incur a loss of less than $500.

The key point here is you're only risking a pre-determined amount at the outset, and there's no possibility of suffering higher losses than that if the trade goes against you. In this case, it's worth noting that our bearish options strategy is a much safer way to bet against MicroStrategy than simply shorting the stock.

On Wednesday NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenbergannouncedthat allies have ""agreed to move forward with planning for a greater NATO role in coordinating security assistance and training."" But it will still be an uphill battle to get some of the 'outlier' members on board.

He also said that Ukraine's government and military still has ""urgent needs"" and that ""any delay in providing support has consequences on the battlefield as we speak.""

""We must ensure reliable and predictable security assistance to Ukraine for the long haul so that we rely less on the voluntary contributions and more on NATO commitments, less on short-term offers and more on multiyear pledges,"" Stoltenberg said. ""The reason why we do this is the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine. It is serious … We see how Russia is pushing, and we see how they try to win this war by just waiting us out.""

Stoltenberg's words come the day afterhe unveiled a $100 billion, five-year fund for Ukrainewhich he subsequently pitched to alliance foreign ministers as they met Wednesday.

It is meant to both close the gap after Biden's proposed $60 billion has been stymied by Republicans in US Congress, andin future expectation of a possible Trump victory after November.

Stoltenberg said a final decision on the $100 billion fund would be made at a July summit of NATO member state leaders; however, the big hurdle will be achieving the required consensus among the 32 members,

Hungary has already announced its ""opposition to increasing NATO’s coordination role in arms deliveries and training Ukrainian forces, refusing to participate in planning, operations, or funding,"" according to a foreign ministry statement.

Thus Brussels is in for yetanother fight with its wayward Hungarian member state led by Viktor Orban, who has time and again vowed to reject any measure which could pave a path of escalation to WW3 with Russia.

But Stoltenberg is already seeking to calm Budapest's fears and bring it on board. ""What we are discussing isnot a NATO combat presence in Ukraine. We are discussing how we can coordinate and deliver support from outside Ukraine to Ukraine as NATO allies do,"" Stoltenberg said. ""And now when we initiate planning,I’m certain we can also address the concerns that Hungary has raised and find a way where we can have consensus.""

2024-04-04 05:00:00,Financial Flim-Flam Backs Imran Ahmed's Center For Countering Digital Hate,https://web.archive.org/web/20240404114725/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/financial-flim-flam-backs-imran-ahmeds-center-countering-digital-hate,"Authored by Paul Thacker via The Disinformation Chronicle(subscribehere)

The dark money that apparently birthed the censorship industry’s most critical “anti-disinformation” group, theCenter for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH),recently came to light in an investigationby The Telegraph, which uncovered £700,000in undeclared donations to British Labour Party politico Morgan McSweeney.And who’s McSweeney?Hehelped found CCDH in the UK in 2018—the same timespan when millionaire venture capitalists and businessmen were sending McSweeney secret money, triggeringan investigation by Britain’s Electoral Commission.

As Ifirst reported last October,Imran Ahmed is a Labour Party political operative who maintains close ties to intelligence agencies and began running CCDH from D.C. in 2021, when he started working closely with the Biden administration. That first year in D.C., Ahmed took in 75% of his donations from a dark money pass through, although new Internal Revenue Service (IRS) documents show Ahmed provided false information to the U.S. federal government to receive tax-exempt, nonprofit status.

“A finding that there is a materially incorrect statement on an application for tax exempt status should hopefully encourage the IRS to take a hard look,”said Dean Zerbe, a tax attorney with consulting firm Alliant, and aformer Senate stafferwho investigated corruption in the nonprofit industry.

While he was based in the U.K., Imran Ahmed ran both theCCDH and another Labour Party front group, Stop Funding Fake News (SFFN), to attack British leftists, to defund the Canary news site, and to remove Jeremy Corbyn as Labour Party’s leftist leader. Both CCDH and SFFN wielded wide influence in British politics and posed as grassroots movements, until reporters atthe Canaryexposed the groups’ ties to Labour Party conservatives Imran Ahmed and Morgan McSweeney.

Both CCDH and SFFN websitesoperated from the same server, andCCDH shared its addresswith Labour Together,an organization McSweeney organized as a campaign slush fund for Labour Party internecine warfare. After runnning Labour Party leftist Jeremy Corbyn out of leadership, Labour Together then helped elect Keir Starmer as Labour’s conservative leader.

Once Starmer defeated Corbyn to become Labour Party leader, McSweeney joined his staff asStarmer’s election guru.

While neither CCDH nor SFFN reported any donors—either to support their organizations or Imran Ahmed’s salary—Matt Taibbi’s Racket News reportedthat the money appears to have come from hidden donations to Labour Together.

The Telegraph reported further financialdetails of Labour Together, which appears to have served as McSweeney’s political slush fund.

Labour Together was fined £14,250 for its failure to register donations totalling £739,000.

However, there is now the prospect of a new investigation by the Electoral Commission after The Telegraph discovered Mr McSweeney contacted the regulator in 2017 and was told that funds needed to be registered, according to documents obtained underFOI.

Asjournalist and author Paul Holden documents, McSweeney’s Labour Together operated as a cut out for conservatives to raise hidden campaign funds from wealthy donors and drive Jeremy Corbyn from leadership.

After Ahmed arrived in the United States, he continued to operate in the financial shadows. According to tax records, he started running CCDH from D.C. in 2021, wherethe Schwab Charitable Fundreporteda$1.1 million private donation to CCDH. Schwab Charitable Fund is a “donor-advised fund” which allows people to set up private accounts that obscures their donations. The $1.1 million donation happened in Ahmed’s first year operating in the U.S., when IRS tax records report heraised $1.47 millionfor CCDH—meaning almost 75% of CCDH’s first-year donations came from one private, dark money donor.

Ahmed did not respond to questions about the money behind CCDH, nor who has paid his salary in the past.

Attorneys with the law firm Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reathfiled CCDH’s 2021 submission to the IRSfor tax-exempt status and falsely claimed CCDH was operating as a registered charity in the U.K. The IRS documents were obtained by Paul Holden, an investigative journalist whose book, “The Fraud: Keir Starmer, Labour Together, and the Crisis of British Democracy”, will be published later this year.

Attorney Joe Miller with Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath did not respond to an email asking him to explain why the firm filed false paperwork with the IRS.

Since coming to DC, Ahmed has tried to position himself as a leftist, even though he and others on the Labour Party conservative wing helped to push out leftist Jeremy Corbyn from Labour leadership. One of Ahmed’s biggest supporters on social media is the actorMark Ruffalo, who regularly tweets in Ahmed’s support.

Ironically, Ruffalo was one of many Hollywood celebrities who voicedsupport for Jeremy Corbyn, before Ahmed and CCDH helped drive him from power. Ahmed's current board forCCDH includes Aileen Keshishian, who isRuffalo’s agent.

“US progressives may have come to know Imran Ahmed as an ally in their battle against Trump and his politics,” says James Schneider, who was spokesperson for Corbyn when he led the Labour Party. “But Ahmed's political origins in the UK are far from progressive. He worked against the leadership of the Labour Party when it was led by the progressive Jeremy Corbyn. Especially in the murky world of ‘disinfo’, the enemy of your enemy is not always your friend.”

Many of CCDH’s employees are not listed on the group’s website, except for one:Callum Hood, who is CCDH head of research. Neither Hood nor any other CCDH employee isacknowledged in CCDH’s reports, and onhis LinkedIn page, Hood lists the Center for Countering Digital Hate as the only job he has ever held.

Digging into Hood’s background, I found that, like Imran Ahmed, he staffed a member of Labour Party’s conservative wing. Accordingto British Parliament records, Hood worked for Labour Party MP, Ian Austin.

Austin helpedlead the charge against Corbyn’s leadershipof the British government, urging voters to back Conservative Boris Johnson for Prime Minster. Johnsonthen recommended Austinto the House of Lords, where he now goes by the title “Lord Austin of Dudley.”

Ahmed seems loathe to discuss his ties to the intelligence community, links which became more obvious in emails made public last week. AsI reported in Octoberfor Tablet:

One rumor that came up often in the dozen or so conversations I’ve had, with people who have observed Ahmed for years, is that he works for British intelligence. Along with other questions emailed to Ahmed a couple weeks back, Tablet asked him to address the allegation he is connected to British intelligence, but he did not respond to repeated requests for comment. One of Ahmed’s long-standing friends told me that Ahmed once mentioned that he had applied to either MI5 or MI6. Because the conversation took place so long ago, the friend couldn’t remember which of the two British intelligence agencies it was, and they never later discussed if he had gotten in.

New emails from the Biden administration findCCDH partnered with American intelligence agenciesto support social media censorship.

In early 2022, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Under Secretary Robert Silvers connected with CCDH’s then-Head of Policy, Eva Hartshorn-Sanders, to discuss research and strategies for social media censoring.

“I’ll organize for the invitations to our Global Summit and Changemakers Dinner event to be sent through to you separately,” Hartshorn-Sanders emailed Silvers. “We’d love to see you there.”

The following day,DHS members began organizinga meeting with CCDH, which sent further invites to CCDH’s upcoming dinner event. By September 2022, CCDH had begun briefing the White House, the National Security Council, and the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism to act against social media companies.

“We are happy to meet with you to discussthe other findings in this report, answer any questions, and work with the White House team on providing further evidence, recommendations, or ways to place pressure on platforms to act on this disturbing content,” CCDH’s Hartshorn-Sanders emailed.

After the Biden White House released a 2023blueprint to address “online harassment”that included National Institutes of Health (NIH) academic funding for “disinformation research,” CCDH claimed victory. “Great to see the publication of the White House’s initial Blueprint and to have been able to feed in research and policy recommendations for its development.” CCDH’s Hartshorn-Sanders posted on LinkedIn.

When CCDH’s emails with the White House and intelligence agencies became public last week, Hartshorn-Sanders then shut down her LinkedIn account.

2024-04-04 05:45:00,Amazon Scrapping 'Just Walk Out' Technology At Fresh Stores,https://web.archive.org/web/20240404114725/https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/amazon-scrapping-just-walk-out-technology-fresh-stores,"Authored by Katabella Roberts via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Amazon is ditching its “Just Walk Out” technology that allows customers to shop and leave stores without having to visit a typical physical checkout, company officials have confirmed.

Instead, the Seattle-based company will replace the technology with smart carts, also known as “dash carts,” through which customers can skip the checkout line.

That technology, effectively a scanner integrated into a shopping cart, also provides additional benefits, such as allowing consumers to scan their items as they shop and see their spending in real time via an onscreen receipt.

An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the change in a statement to USA TODAY, notingthe decision will only impact Amazon Fresh locations—the company’s online and physical grocery stores—and not Amazon Go convenience stores.

The company said it is also keeping Just Walk Out technology in place at a small number of Fresh stores in the United Kingdom.

In addition, the decision will not impact the more than 130 third-party retailers that Amazon partners with across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada for its Just Walk Out technology across locations including cafes, airports, stadiums, entertainment venues, conference centers, schools, and more, the spokesperson said.

The decision was made following customer feedback, the company official noted.

“We’ve invested a lot of time redesigning a number of our Amazon Fresh stores over the last year, offering a better overall shopping experience with more value, convenience, and selection, and so far we’ve seen positive results, with higher customer shopping satisfaction scores and increased purchasing,” Jessica Martin, Amazon spokesperson, told the publication.

“We’ve also heard from customers that while they enjoyed the benefit of skipping the checkout line with Just Walk Out, they also wanted the ability to easily find nearby products and deals, view their receipt as they shop, and know how much money they saved while shopping throughout the store,” she said.

According to its official website, Amazon’s “Just Walk Out” technology— first rolled out in 2016—allows consumers to “enter a store, grab what they want, and get going” by scanning their card or hovering their palm over an Amazon One device when they enter the store.

They are then able to leave without having to visit a formal checkout, thanks to cameras, sensors, and deep-learning artificial intelligence (AI) that track consumers visiting the stores.

The technology is used not only in Amazon’s own physical stores but also in third-party retail, travel, and stadium environments, the website states.

However, the technology hasn’t always proven to be reliable, with some customers complaining that it often took hours to receive their receipts after leaving the stores, according to reports.

Lawsuits were also filed over the technology that accused Amazon offailing to notify all customerswho entered its Amazon Go stores that cameras were collecting and storing their biometric data.

Amazon currently operates more than 40 Fresh grocery stores across the United States, the majority of which are in California, Illinois, Virginia, and Washington state.

Approximately 27 of those stores have Just Walk Out technology and will transition to Amazon Dash Cart, according to the company. The remaining stores already use Amazon Dash Cart, the retailer said.

According to its official website, Amazon Dash Cart— first unveiled in 2020—is a smart cart that can be accessed by customers using a QR code on their Amazon app.

The technology uses a combination of computer vision algorithms and sensor fusion technology to scan items placed in and removed from the carts and shows real-time receipts of all items in the cart via an attached screen. After purchasing their items, customers can simply exit the store through the Amazon Dash Cart lane and their payment is processed using the credit card associated with their Amazon account.

Consumers will still be able to pay at a traditional checkout with a cashier or use the self-checkout machines, Amazon noted.

The former minister is the first woman who was made head of government in the country andthe 17th female head of government or state on the African continent.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is governed under a semi-presidential system where an elected president and an appointed prime minister share executive powers, similar to the systems of France and Russia.

As Statista's Katharina Buchholz reports,data by the Council on Foreign Relationsshows thatEurope is generally the region with the highest concentration offemale-ledand repeatedly female-led nations.

You will find more infographics atStatista

All the countries which have had three or more female leaders (with the exceptions of Trinidad and Tobago, New Zealand and India) are located there.The one which has had the most females at the helm is Switzerland.The country counts five former female presidents of the Swiss Confederation, but has an advantage because the presidents' terms are limited to one year.

Finlandfollows with four female prime ministers or presidents, including Sanna Marin, who was premier from 2019 to 2023. Iceland has counted three female leaders. One of them, Vigdís Finnbogadóttir, was the world's first female elected president. She stayed in office for 16 years from 1980 to 1996.

The source counts women who have served as heads of government, heads of state or a combination of the two, except when the position was temporary, purely honorary or was filled by a monarch or appointed by one.

2024-04-04 07:20:00,Gold's Defiance Of Real Yields Can't Last Unless Trouble Brewing,https://web.archive.org/web/20240404114725/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/golds-defiance-real-yields-cant-last-unless-trouble-brewing#comment-stream,"By Garfield Reynolds, Bloomberg markets live reporter and strategist

Gold’s surge to record highs is extraordinary — coming as it does in the face of elevated real yields that would normally bring it crashing down.That signals the metal is likely to rapidly reverse this year’s climb,unless risk assets collapse because of an economic or financial crisis.

The 10-year real yield is still around 2%, a level unseen since 2009.That should hurt a non-interest-bearing asset like gold, but it isn’t. The previous two times before the current surge when gold hit record highs were times of negative real yields — during the pandemic and in 2011-12 as Europe’s sovereign debt woes followed on the heels of the global financial crisis.

Back before the introduction of TIPS allowed the ready tracking of market expectations for real rates,the precious metal’s ascent to a record in 1980 came when 10-year nominal yields were well below the inflation rate.

That makes gold’s rally this year vulnerable,though it may also signal investors are becoming worried that major turmoil is coming.The surge that peaked in 2011 blew past gold’s 1980 high at the start of 2008, well before the collapse of Lehman Brothers.

It’s possible the real boon for the yellow metal is negative sentiment, rather than negative real yields.

2024-04-04 07:45:00,Statewide Emergency Declared In Indiana Ahead Of Solar Eclipse,https://web.archive.org/web/20240404114725/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/statewide-emergency-declared-indiana-ahead-solar-eclipse,"Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb issued a statewide emergency due to a large influx of visitors to his state to view the total solar eclipse on April 8.

The Republican official said that the number of visitors to Indiana may strain the state’s communications, transportation, and emergency response systems, warranting the need for the declaration. Indiana includes some of the best locations in the United States to see the eclipse,accordingto a map of the path of totality.

“The massive number of people viewing this event in our state may well stress and/or interfere with first responder and public safety communications and emergency response systems such that a technological or other emergency may occur,” Mr. Holcombsaidin a statement last week, adding that the declaration was issued as a precaution to bring in emergency resources from other states.

His order noted thatthe eclipse “will pass directly over the state of Indiana, giving everyone in our state an incredible view of this extremely rare event.”The order stated that the last time a total solar eclipse passed over the state was in 1869. After the event on April 8, the next one is not expected to occur for about another 75 years.

“It is of primary importance to the state of Indiana to be prepared to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public during this event and to be prepared to swiftly and effectively respond to any emergency that may arise,” the order continued.

The state’s capital and largest city, Indianapolis, is located in the eclipse’s path of totality, local media reported.

Officials in other U.S. states have issued advisories or warnings ahead of the astronomical event. Authorities in Ohio’s Summit County, for example, advised residents to “stay home” due to traffic congestion by an expected influx of viewers, while officials from the Illinois Department of Transportation warned that crowd sizes could be massive in some areas.

“Crowds of 100,000 to 200,000 are expected to come to the prime viewing area in southern Illinois,” the Illinois agency said. “All roads in and out of the area are expected to have heavy congestion in the couple hours after the eclipse.”

Multiple counties in Texas declared emergencies due to the upcoming April 8 total solar eclipse due to potentially heavy traffic and gridlock.

On Monday, the Bosque County Office of Emergency Management declared a state of emergency due to heavy traffic and will authorize the county to take “any actions necessary to promote life, safety and critical infrastructure protection.”

The population of Bosque County is expected to significantly increase because “tens of thousands of visitors” may travel to the area to view the eclipse, possibly straining local resources and fuel supplies, officialssaid. Traffic congestion is expected, triggering the emergency declaration because “extraordinary measures must be taken to ensure the protection of public health, safety and welfare of Bosque County residents and visitors.”

Last week, Kaufman County Judge Jakie Allenissueda disaster declaration due to the “projected and expected number of visitors” in the area. County officials have said that some 200,000 people may visit the county to view the eclipse.

“The dramatic increase in population, even for a short time, will greatly impact our public safety agencies, taxing their ability to respond to calls,”county officials said.

Travis County, which includes the capital of Austin,issueda similar declaration last month due to the anticipated crowd sizes, said Judge Andy Brown. He said the population of the county could potentially double in the days surrounding the total eclipse.

“It’s super exciting to see this once-in-a-lifetime event,” the official said. “What makes it different is that it is a natural phenomenon, and we can’t control the weather around it. So there’s a lot of variables that we just can’t control for.”

According to the Dallas Morning News,the Texas Hill Country may be one of the best spots to view the eclipse in the United States.

But a significant influx of tourists may “cause extreme traffic congestion on our roadways, place an enormous strain on our first responders and hospital systems, drain our food and fuel supplies and strain our city and county infrastructure to, quite possibly, overcapacity,” Kerr County Judge Rob Kellysaidlast month.

Meanwhile, last week, a state of emergency was declared in the Canadian Niagara Falls region, adjacent to the city of Niagara Falls in New York state, due to traffic and crowd sizes.

The city is also in the path of totality, which will receive no solar rays for a few minutes on April 8 as the moon blocks the sun. Niagara Falls Mayor Jim Diodati said in March that he expects the most visitors his city has ever seen in a single day.

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul warned travelers in the state to expect high amounts of traffic as several eclipse-viewing events will be held. She said that lane closures and construction will be halted ahead of the astronomical event.

Yesterday, ZeroHedge posted a piece entitledThe Next AI Trade, which, while on the surface of it was about AI; once read was loaded with info on America's insufficient power generation sources and dilapidated transmission infrastructure woven from multiple bank perspectives and their own insights.

Among the industry recommendations noted was the growing push for Nuclear power. Within that sector, Cameco was discussed in context of Goldman initiating coverage. This video is a summary of that  Cameco analysis

The Bank's 34 page report with slides have been broken out at bottom. It contains industry information including financials, industry fundamentals, and  geopolitical drivers Frankly, its all you need if you want to get familiar with the investment potential, and if you already understand the industry, you can compare your assessments with theirs.If you want to understand the opportunity better in context of  the industry, the ZeroHedge post noted up top is a must read.

Point 1. We see Estimate Change Potential from Better Realized Prices vs Consensus Estimates Longer Term

Point 2. Integrated Business Model Provides Exposure to Entire Value Chain vs more Isolated Peers

Point 3. Estimate Revisions Should Be Aided by the Migration of Demand to Cameco

2024-04-04 13:54:37,Gold Is on the Rise and Reaches All-Time High,https://web.archive.org/web/20240405105559/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-04/gold-rise-and-reaches-all-time-high,"BY PAUL WONG | TUESDAY, APRIL 2, 2024

Source: Bloomberg and Sprott Asset Management LP. Data as of March 31, 2024.*QTD % Chg and YTD % Chg for this Index are calculated as the difference between the quarter end's yield and the previous period end's yield, instead of the percentage change. BPS stands for basis points. **ETF holdings are measured by Bloomberg Indices; the ETFGTOTL is the Bloomberg Total Known ETF Holdings of Gold Index; the ETSITOTL is the Bloomberg Total Known ETF Holdings of Silver Index.

For the quarter ending March 31, 2024, gold bullion rose $166.89 (or 8.09%) to close at $2,229.87, an all-time closing high. After testing the $2,000 gold level several times in 2023, gold closed above that level in December and has not looked back. Several factors are pressing gold to new highs. Simplistically, a massive, relatively price-insensitive buyer (central banks and sovereigns) is providing persistent support. At the same time, another large cohort (investment funds as represented by CFTC7and ETF positioning) is essentially caught in a short squeeze.8Aiding the gold price are signs that the U.S. dollar (USD) is making a significant top, and yields are peaking as global central banks are set to begin a synchronized easing cycle.

The broad stock market has been moving higher as the Federal Reserve (Fed) maintains its outlook for three interest rate cuts in 2024, the U.S. economic growth outlook improves, inflation (though bumpy) continues to track lower, and the U.S. Treasury continues to place more issuances into the shorter maturity end of the yield curve. A phenomenal AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven growth outlook has sparked higher earnings revisions while financial conditions remain highly accommodative, allowing equities ample scope for price multiple expansions. A soft landing, moderating inflation, accommodative central banks, ample system liquidity, a secular growth engine (AI) and easy financial conditions have fueled this ""everything rally”.

Figure 1 highlights the bullish gold chart progression over the past 10 years. After the 2016-2019 consolidation breakout, gold surged to $2,064 in August 2020 and went into a three-year consolidation trading pattern before breaking to new highs in March. In a familiar recurrence, the 2016-2019 gold price consolidation was driven by the Fed attempting to normalize its balance sheet (QT or quantitative tightening), and the breakout triggered by the Fed pivoting (the ""Powell Pivot"") to easing and ending balance sheet normalization as the Repo market (a systematic important source of market function liquidity)9became dysfunctional. The final thrust to $2,064 in August 2020 was due to the massive monetary response to the COVID-induced recession and financial system crisis. In the current situation, parallel to 2016-2019, the Fed has pivoted with pending interest rate cuts, the end of QT is in sight, and during Q4 2023, the U.S. Treasury market showed signs of extreme liquidity impairment, much like the Repo market experienced in the prior cycle.

Past extended bullish gold trends typically follow this pattern (although due to different causes): higher price thrust, consolidation and thrust. We believe several fundamental factors are in place for gold to potentially go higher, which we highlight in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Gold Bullion's Technical Breakout(2014-2024)

Source: Bloomberg. Data as of 3/31/2024. Included for illustrative purposes only. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Figure 2 highlights a comparative analysis of the two large cohorts of gold buyers: Central banks and CFTC plus ETFs combined (investment flows). The chart calibrated to zero starting December 31, 2015, the low of the current gold cycle. Initially, until mid-2020, central banks and investment funds were accumulating gold at the same pace on a net basis. Since Q3 2020, the buying pattern has diverged dramatically, with central banks adding a net 2,630 metric tons (MT) while CFTC and ETFs sold a net 854 MT to the end of 2023. Notably, around mid-2022, the buying of central banks intensified during the Russia-Ukraine war and the subsequent seizure/freezing of Russia's FX (foreign exchange) reserves. As of December 2023 (last reported central bank positioning), the delta has widened to over 2,980 MT (or 95.8 million ounces).

We have discussed the motivations for aggressive central bank buying in past commentaries, especially our February 2023 posting (First Gold Dip Since Central Bank Buying Spree). Factors influencing their decisions include the pressing need to diversify reserves in light of potential sanctions and the risk of foreign exchange reserve seizures. There is also a growing preference for ""outside money"" (assets not linked to any specific country) in central bank reserves, a reaction to the trend of USD weaponization and moves toward de-dollarization, a strategy to hedge against inflation and the impact of relaxed monetary policy on global currencies and sovereign bonds, and a means of insuring against the escalating geopolitical tensions associated with deglobalization.

The critical point is that over the past one and a half years, central banks have increased their average quarterly gold purchases to 313 metric tons versus the pre-2022 decade of 127 metric tons (2.5x greater), altering their strategic rationale. Central banks' objectives and purchasing logic have diverged significantly from those of investment funds. This change is a crucial driver for the current departure of gold bullion pricing from the correlations and patterns observed in the last 20 years. Also, note that the size of central banks (and sovereigns) dwarfs any investment flow, and their definition of a “store of value” for sovereign reserves vastly differs from an investment fund's definition of a “store of value”, both in meaning and size.

Figure 3 illustrates a significant divergence in the gold market. While central banks and sovereign purchases have driven gold prices to record highs, the gold holdings by CFTC and ETFs have decreased, falling back to levels last seen in mid-2019 when gold was at the $1,375 resistance. This trend has continued into the year-to-date (YTD) 2024, with further reductions in their gold positions. The lower panel of Figure 3 shows that the current scale of drawdown in CFTC and ETF positions would typically be associated with a sharp gold price correction or even a bear market, yet gold prices are at all-time highs.

Despite no significant news events or market catalysts on Friday, March 1—particularly with Asian markets closed—gold prices broke out from a multi-year consolidation pattern. The breakout was not driven by any clear external trigger, suggesting that it may have resulted from forced short-covering. Unlike spikes caused by specific risk events, which tend to reverse as traders take profits quickly, this sustained breakout suggests the market has more enduring strength. Investment funds, including CFTC and ETFs, appear to be ""effectively short gold,"" given their very low gold exposure. Our previous commentaries have pointed out that the widening gap between gold prices and CFTC and ETF positions was unsustainable and may likely to lead to a price squeeze, which the market is now witnessing unfolding. The purchasing behavior of central banks and sovereigns is creating a rising price floor for gold, acting as a de facto ""gold put"".

The Shanghai gold price premium is the difference in price for an ounce of gold between the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) and the global gold price, typically benchmarked against the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) or New York COMEX. The higher the premium, the more willing buyers in China are to pay for gold over the international price, providing a live implied demand indicator (see Figure 4). The blue line in Figure 4 is the 200-day moving average of the gold premium, indicating a growing demand trend. The spike in Q3 2023 was related to the turmoil in China's real estate market as prices fell amid negative credit headlines, and the recent pullback is associated with the recent price spike. There is clear evidence—although difficult to fully quantify—that the general population is buying gold as a hedge to protect against their high wealth exposure to the fragile property market.

There is no live data on central banks and sovereign buying, but typically, they do not chase higher prices but resume buying on pullbacks. For example, the Shanghai gold price premium fell from a +1.8 standard deviation reading to a -2 standard deviation level (two-year range), meaning gold buying from China faded as prices spiked. In the longer term, the question will be what the new floor price is likely to be for gold from central banks and sovereigns. Assuming global tensions persist and the trend toward deglobalization continues, central banks and sovereigns may likely maintain a supportive influence on gold prices, similar to the ""Fed put"" in financial markets.

Options trading has a historical precedent for affecting gold prices. Figure 5 shows the total open interest on GLD10and CFTC gold futures contracts. Both show that low multi-year readings were reached (the red dashed marks the 10% percentile level over the past 10 years). If options activity picks up (especially if implied volatility increases), there could be another significant source of bullish market influence for gold. The low open interest readings suggested that price expectations were muted for gold despite the enormous central bank and sovereign buying.

The first panel of Figure 5 shows that GLD's total open interest (calls plus puts) is at the low end of its 10-year range, near the 10%-tile 10-year range. The notional value11of the GLD total open interest is about $49.2 billion at quarter end. The second panel highlights the total open interest in CFTC gold futures over the past 10 years, reaching the 10%-tile level in February. The notional value of the CFTC gold total open interest is about $112 billion and has picked up in March. Relative to historical positioning levels, there is considerable potential for GLD and gold futures to increase open interest levels and serve as a potent bullish force on the gold market.

For the March 31, 2024 quarter, silver bullion rose $1.17 (or 4.91%) to close at $24.96, just below some critical technical price levels. Figure 6 highlights silver sitting just below a significant breakout level of a bullish triangle. There are several possible bullish patterns (fractal iterations), with the differences mainly related to the timing and pattern progression of the price trend. The main point is that multiple bullish configurations (market psychological imprinting) are not typical and reinforce the bullish narrative. All the potential chart patterns on silver bullion project a price of at least $30, the breakout level required to set multi-decade-long chart patterns into motion.

We see three primary drivers for a higher silver price: 1) silver maintaining its monetary value as gold prices go higher from central bank and sovereign buying, 2) silver's correlation to the reflation trade and 3) the massive consumption of silver for photovoltaic panels due to the new growth phase for U.S. electricity demand.

The primary macroeconomic driver remains central banks and sovereigns buying gold. Silver has lagged mainly because central banks and sovereigns are not buying silver. Despite this, with its associated reserve monetary value, silver has not broken its correlation with gold. Figure 7 highlights the rolling 20-week correlation of gold and silver over the past 10 years. The pre- and post-2H2022 correlations (the start of the massive central bank and sovereign gold buying) remain identical. Silver prices are anticipated to be drawn upward in tandem with gold due to its continuing alignment with gold's monetary value.

Figure 7. Silver Maintains Its Correlation with Gold(2014-2024)

Source: Bloomberg. Data as of 3/31/2024. Included for illustrative purposes only. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Silver has long correlated with economic activity due to its wide range of industrial applications. For this reason, silver and copper are well correlated with a 0.73 R-square12since 2000. Global central banks (ex-Bank of Japan) are now entering a synchronized easing cycle, which is likely to benefit the reflation trade. Commodities like copper—and, by extension, silver due to their similar economic correlation—may likely perform well as high beta plays of this reflation trade. Generally, the higher the reflation expectations, the better the commodity cyclical trade plays out. We believe most reflation-linked assets are underweighted as recession forecasts have only recently dissipated.

OurFebruary 2024 Energy Transition Materials Commentaryhighlighted the explosive growth in solar power generation now that it's the most cost-effective source of electricity. For the past 20 years, growth in electricity demand has been only 0.4% per annum, well below GDP (gross domestic product), mainly due to gains in energy efficiencies. We will have more details in our upcoming Energy Transition Materials report on electricity demand growth, but U.S. electricity demand is on the brink of a significant growth phase. U.S. policy and the accompanying fiscal spending continue to accelerate the reshoring of the U.S. industrial and manufacturing base and their associated supply chains. The preliminary data for the rise in electricity demand from the expected growth in AI-related use are staggering. Demand from other electrification strategies, cryptocurrency mining, data centers, etc., is expected to increase the electricity demand growth curve.

Figure 8 highlights the sharp increase in the deployment of photovoltaic systems by 2030, with a pronounced spike in 2023 followed by consistent growth. This forecast suggests that current estimates of solar power demand may be too conservative, especially considering the uptick from AI technology, manufacturing reshoring and broader electrification trends. Notably, the demand for solar power in 2030 is projected to be more than triple that of 2022 on this conservative forecast.

For more information on silver and photovoltaics, please see our two prior reports:•Central Banks Support Gold & Solar PV Demand Buoys Silver•Silver Demand Grows as Solar Leads Renewables

Given these considerations, silver inventory and production dynamics are poised to play a significant role in the silver market. The combination of a potentially dwindling free float of silver, steady demand from traditional sectors, and escalating requirements from the burgeoning solar energy industry, particularly with the transition to more silver-intensive technologies, underscores the likelihood of a more pronounced impact on silver prices. This scenario, coupled with the three previously outlined drivers—silver's monetary value, economic correlation and critical role in the solar sector—further solidifies the case for a silver price breakout in the foreseeable future.

2024-04-04 14:43:32,WATCH: Guyana President ANNIHILATES BBC Climate Change™ Hack,https://web.archive.org/web/20240405105559/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-04/watch-guyana-president-annihilates-bbc-climate-changetm-hack,"Originally published viaArmageddon Prose:

Pompous, posh bespectacled BBC state media hack Stephen Sackur — who wears his glasses down on the end of his nose for some inexcusable reason as any run-of-the-mill Cambridge douche might — clearly went into this little propaganda session fully expecting the Guyanese president to cuck himself at the altar of Climate Change™, only to findhimselfbesieged in return by a torrent of righteous indignation at the unmitigated gall of this person to dictate to Guyana what it is and is not permitted to do with its own natural resources — as if the current year is 1864, and overt colonialism is still raging strong.

Related:LGBTQ+™ Neo-Colonialism: Your Taxes Fund Ecuador Drag Show, Transgenderism Confuses Africans

What follows is what the psychoanalysts call “schadenfreude” (relevant part commences at 4:09):

“The president of an oil-rich South American country has scolded a BBC reporter for ‘lecturing’ his nation over climate change.

Irfaan Ali of Guyana sat down with host Stephen Sackur of the BBC HardTalk show for an interview that has now gone viral.

The country has seen a rapid growth in its oil reserves over the past decade. ButMr Sackur was quick to challenge the president on the potential environmental impact of this industry.

He said: ‘Over the next decade or two, it’s expected that there will be $150 billion worth of oil and gas extracted off your coast.

‘It’s an extraordinary figure. But think of it in practical terms.That means – according to many experts – two billion tons of carbon emissions will come from your seabedfrom those reserves and released into the atmosphere.’

But the 43-year-old head of state was quick to jump in with a rebuttal.”

At this turning point in the exchange, I could hear the Mortal Kombat “Finish Him” soundbite in my mind (apologies for the millennial reference), and it titillated me something fierce.

“’Let me stop you right there,’ he said. ‘Did you know that Guyana has a forest that is the size of England and Scotland combined, a forest that stores 19.5 gigatons of carbon, a forest that we have kept alive?’

Guyana sits on the northern coast of the South American continent, bordered by Venezuela to the west, Suriname to the east and Brazil to the south. Much of the country’s landmass is covered by the Amazon rainforest.

When the reporter asked Mr Ali whether the rainforest gave him the ‘right’ to release the carbon, the Guyanese leader retorted: “Does that give you the right to lecture us on climate change?

‘I’m going to lecture you on climate change. Because we have kept this forest alive that you enjoy that the world enjoys, that you don’t pay us for, that you don’t value.

‘Guess what?We have the lowest deforestation rate in the world. And guess what? Even with the greatest exploration of oil and gas we will still be net zero.’”

I would be remiss not to note that Guyana likely has the lowest deforestation rate in the world not because of a commitment to environmental conservation but rather historical underdevelopment. Nonetheless, the validity of the point remains.

“Mr Sackur noted his words were ‘powerful’ and tried to jump back in, but the president did not allow the interruption.

‘This is the hypocrisy that exists in the world,’ he said. ‘The world in the last 50 years has lost 65 per cent of the biodiversity. We have kept ours.’”

Remarkably, this is hardly the first time in recent history that a BBC hack has gotten totally annihilated by the elected leader of a Latin American country.

Considerthis recent exchangebetween another BBC hack and El Salvador president Nayib Bukele over “human rights.”

“I asked him if, now that he had turned the security situation around, he would concentrate on the next stage of the security policy - specifically the legal process of the thousands of people with no gang affiliation who, according to human rights organisations, have been unlawfully jailed.

‘I find it somewhat amusing when people say 'Oh, in El Salvador, they arrest people and some of the arrested are innocent,' President Bukele said.

‘I'm a little baffled because I wonder if in the UK all of the arrests are of guilty people or if sometimes your police arrest innocent ones?,’ he continued.

He conceded that police in El Salvador had made ‘a couple of mistakes’ but said that some 7,000 of those arrested had already been released.

There followed a long answer in which Mr Bukele argued that he was applying a unique solution to El Salvador's unique problem of having long been the murder capital of the world.

Furthermore, he added, El Salvador had tried countless solutions put forward by Washington, the European Union and the Organization of American States but none of them had worked. The answer, he said, was his policy.

‘El Salvador was turned from the most dangerous place in the world to the safest in the Western Hemisphere. That's not a small feat. That's not done easily. No-one in the world has done it before so fast and so clean as we've done it here with no civilian casualties.’”

The audacity of a criminal government like the UK, or the U.S. for that matter, which has imprisoned and tortured Julian Assange for years now for the alleged crime of exposing the state’s crimes (an act called “journalism”) lecturinganyforeign leader on the arrest of innocents!

2024-04-04 18:12:19,Former Federal Reserve Exec Thomas Hoenig: Our Money Is Dying,https://web.archive.org/web/20240406124235/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-04/former-federal-reserve-exec-thomas-hoenig-our-money-dying,"The Federal Reserve is one of, if not the most, significant institutions in the world given the global impact of its policy decisions.

It influences the price of nearly everything, as well as the availability of jobs, the stability of our banking system, and the purchasing power of our money.

When the Fed Chair speaks, the entire world stops to listen.

But the average person has a poor understanding of how this colossally important entity operates. Or even why it exists.

And after a series of asset price bubbles -- which some argue we're in another one now -- a chorus skeptical of the Fed's actions has emerged.

So today we're doing our best to shine as bright a light as possible on the Fed: how & why it operates, the good & as well as the shortcomings of its actions to date, what direction its policies are likely to take from here, and how all of this impacts the households of regular people like you and me.

We have the great privilege of speaking today withThomas Hoenig, former CEO of the Kansas City Fed, former voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, a former director of the FDIC, and now a Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Mercatus Center.

This is an extremely important interview, folks. IMO,perhaps the most significant one I’ve yet done.

Here are my top takeaways from it:

Dr Hoenig admits the Federal Reserve has experienced substantial “mission creep” since its creation as a lender of last resort. Its track record is very much “mixed” in terms of delivering on the intent of its policies. In Dr. Hoenig’s opinion, its efforts to add stability sometimes instead only create more instability.

While very critical of the Fed’s QE and ZIRP policies in the wake of the GFC, and more recently in the $trillions in monetary & fiscal stimulus unleashed post-COVID, Dr Hoenig thinks current Fed policy is “about right”. Though he expects the Fed to come under serious pressure soon as ebbing liquidity allows recessionary forces to build. He thinks the Fed will need to make an important decision within the coming year: return to QE and re-flame inflation, or allow a recession to occur.

Dr Hoenig criticizes the Federal Reserve for pandering to various interests, noting that short-term thinking and pressures from Wall Street, Congress, and interest groups often lead to decisions that prioritize immediate relief over long-term stability — a sort of “We’ll act now for optics sake and hopefully figure things out later”

In Dr Hoenig’s opinion, our fiscal policy is a runaway disaster. He criticizes both political parties of Congress for their roles in the cycle of ever-increasing deficits. Democrats advocate increased spending and tax hikes, while Republicans aim to keep taxes low but fail to curb spending. He warns of dire long-term consequences for future generations due to this impasse.

Dr Hoenig is very worried about the current stability of the banking system (and this from a former Direct of the FDIC!). He advocates for essential reforms to address government spending, prioritize essential areas without relying on future borrowed funds or inflationary measures, and communicate transparently with the public. He stresses the importance of reducing debt growth substantially below national income growth to avoid a full-blown crisis scenario in the future.

Dr Hoenig predicts the purchasing power of the US dollar (and other world fiat currencies) will continue to decline due to current policies and the lack of a “discipline” to money creation. Until such a discipline is restored (perhaps a return to some sort of hard backing of the currency), the dollar’s fall in purchasing power won’t abate.

Dr Hoenig suggests investing time in reading history and biographies as a valuable way to learn about leadership and gain insights into what strategies works and which don't.

2024-04-04 18:31:00,Israel Warns Iran Of Massive Regional War If Directly Attacked,https://web.archive.org/web/20240405105559/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/oil-pushes-higher-reports-uae-severing-aid-coordination-israel-bibi-puts-embassies#comment-stream,"Update(1831ET):With Israel's embassies around the world on a heightened state of alert, and extra IDF reservists called up, and home and weekend leave for all combat troops having been abruptly canceled Thursday, the Israeli population is anxiously awaiting a response - with some reports saying residents are already seeking the safety of bomb shelters.

Tehran has vowed that vengeance is coming soon for the Monday Israeli airstrike on its embassy in Damascus.Most pundits believe this will take the form of ballistic missiles raining down on Israeli cities. But Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly vowing that if the Islamic Republic launches missiles from its soil itwill ensure""a strong response""from Israel.

Israeli officials have toldAxioslate in the day that such an act would""take the current conflict to another level""—which most certainly would involve a direct Israel-Iran war and thus the eruption of a broader regional conflict.Axiosadds the followingobservations:

Netanyahu informed his security cabinet Thursday that Israel's forces have already been engaged with Iran ""both directly and via its proxies, and therefore Israel is operating against Iran and its proxies, both defensively and offensively.""

A statement issued by the prime minister's office laid out: ""We will know how to defend ourselves and will operate according to the basic principle of whoever is harming or planning to harm us — we will harm him."" The White House has meanwhile issued a statement shortly after Biden and Netanyahu discussed the Gaza crisis, saying ""President Biden made clear that the United States strongly supports Israel in the face of those [Iranian] threats.""

There have meanwhile been unverified reports to emerge saying that theCIA has warned Israel to expect an attack from Iran within the next 48 hours, which has also been picked up inIsraeli press.

At this point Israel's ties with key Gulf countries like the UAE are near breaking point, after only a few short years ago diplomatic normalization was hailed through Trump's Abraham accords. But international and Israeli press reports are confirming the UAE has announced it ishalting all coordination on humanitarian aid with Israel.

Further, as Israeli mediareports: ""The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has announced a suspension of diplomatic coordination with Israel in the wake of the death of seven World Central Kitchen humanitarian workers in Gaza."" Simultaneously, Israel is busyputting its embassies across the world on high security alertdue to the ""heightened Iranian response threat"" in wake of Monday's Israeli attack on the Iranian embassy in Damascus. All of this served to send Brent soaring in the last two hours, with Brent spiking above $90 for the first time since October....

... and sending stocks tumbling to session lows.

With Iran vowing that its retaliation is coming at any moment, Israel's military is scrambling for readiness, with the latest measure being topause all home leave for all combat troops.

""The IDF is at war and the issue of the deployment of forces is constantly reviewed as needed,"" the Israeli military said.

President Biden ismeanwhileissaid to be ""pissed"" with PM Netanyahuover the killing of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza, though Israel acknowledged that it was a ""grave mistake"".

#BREAKING: Israel raises alert level at embassies worldwide to maximum, evacuates missions in several countries, and relocates representatives to secure locations due to heightened Iranian response threat, according to Hebrew media reports.pic.twitter.com/IZGOxl34Ok

So far this sounds like more mere empty words of ""concern"" - a talking point that's been on repeat from the White House even as its Gaza policy continues slowly fracturing the Democratic base - but Biden is said to have pressed Bibi for""an immediate ceasefire"".

The call readout further said ceasefire is needed to ""protect innocent civilians"" in Gaza and improve the humanitarian situation. Axioswritesthat Biden gave his Israeli counterpart an""ultimatum""as the US president ""emphasized that the strikes on humanitarian workers and the overall humanitarian situation are unacceptable.""

2024-04-04 21:40:00,"California Bill Mandating ""Pregnancy Dignity"" For ""Birthing Persons"" Passes Health Committee",https://web.archive.org/web/20240405105559/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/california-bill-mandating-pregnancy-dignity-birthing-persons-passes-health-committee,"Authored by Travis Gillmore via The Epoch Times,

Some advocates for women’s rights are speaking out against a bill passed April 2 by the California Assembly’s Health Committee due to language in the measure that calls women “birthing persons.”

At issue isAssembly Bill 2319—introduced by Democratic Assemblywoman Lori Wilson and sponsored by California Attorney General Rob Bonta—which saysthe Legislature recognizes “all birthing people, including nonbinary persons and persons of transgender experience.”The bill additionally mandates “implicit bias training” for existing medical professionals by June 1, 2025, and within six months for those opening new practices.

A prior bill, Assembly 241 passed in 2019, also mandated such training, but an investigation by the state’s attorney general’s office found many medical providers were not following the law.

Proponents argued the new bill is necessary to reduce black maternal and infant deaths—citing statistics that show significantly higher mortality rates for black women during birth compared to white women.

While acknowledging that mortality rates during birth for black women are a legitimate concern, opposition witnesses took exception to the language regarding transgender and non-binary individuals.

“They really pushed in the hearing that it was to fight the black maternal mortality rate,”Sophia Lorey, key opposition witness and outreach director for the California Family Council, told The Epoch Times after the hearing.

“That is a portion of the bill, but they chose not to address that they call women ‘birthing people’ and that it’s also focused on non-binary people and transgender people, so that’s what we pushed in opposition.”

She argued during the hearing that the bill is “force-feeding medical lunacy.”

“We focused on the fact that only women can give birth, and it’s illogical to say anything different, and it’s not implicit bias to believe that only women can give birth,”Ms. Lorey said.

Assemblywoman Mia Bonta, chair of the health committee and wife of Mr. Bonta, the state’s attorney general, concluded the hearing by declaring that transgender men and non-binary people can give birth, a comment opponents rejected.

“They ended the committee hearing with the chair making sure that we all knew that men can give birth,”Ms. Lorey said.

Such is not the first occasion key issues of a measure are either ignored or side-stepped during committee hearings.

Senate Bill 59, currently under consideration by the Legislature, which would put menstrual products in men’s restrooms, was handled in a similar fashion during hearings last year.

“We see this happen in multiple bills,”Ms. Lorey said.

“During hearings, they chose not to refer to that part of the bill at all, and they only talked about free menstrual products in women’s restrooms.”

She said the approach is deceptive and misleads the public, but given the controversial nature of the topic, she expects the trend to continue.

“This isn’t the first time they’ve done this, and it’s not going to be the last,” Ms. Lorey said. “They just tend to mention the parts of bills that make them seem like great bills, and we have to come out and let people know what the bills are really going to do.”

The section of the health code described in AB 2319 contains a $75,000 fine for a first offense if medical providers fail to comply with the implicit bias training, and subsequent instances are subject to fines of $125,000.

Opponents argued that fining medical providers for not supporting transgender agendas is unacceptable and disregards the science of sexual dimorphism in the human species.

“[Providers are fined] for simply not agreeing with their ideology that men can give birth, that’s what they’re trying to force,” Ms. Lorey said.

Another opposition witness said the choice to couch the transgender language in a bill meant to improve healthcare for black women is manipulative.

“This is how the Democrats do it,”Erin Friday, a California-based attorney and parent advocate, told The Epoch Times after the hearing.

“They have a good aspect of a bill which is designed to ensure that black women get the maternal care that they need, but then they throw in a dose of transgenderism.”

The method is a political tactic, she said.

“They do this routinely in so many bills, and they change the language,”Ms. Friday said.

“And if you don’t go along with the language, they easily call you a racist.”

Arguing that women’s rights are jeopardized by the term “birthing persons,” she said the bill is “creating a new religion of transgenderism” and that women across the state are endangered by the measure.

“It was absolutely galling to hear them call women ‘birthing people,’” Ms. Friday said. “They’re erasing women because now we’re ‘birthing people.’”

One committee member said he was voting for the bill to protect black people, saying that he was confused by those opposing it.

“We have to protect all African Americans no matter what, and I’m not really understanding what the opposition is,”Assemblyman Reginald Jones-Sawyer said before voting in favor.

After clearing the health committee, the bill will next be heard by the Assembly’s Appropriations Committee on a date yet to be determined.

2024-04-04 22:20:00,Maybe The Academic Bubble Is Finally Popping,https://web.archive.org/web/20240405105559/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/maybe-academic-bubble-finally-popping,"Authored by Jeffrey A. Tucker via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Academia has fallen on hard times, most signified by the disgrace of Harvard. When high-paid, high-status professors are revealed as plagiarists, and then kept on with high six-figure salaries anyway, and when others are fired for opposing inhumane COVID-19 controls, one has to wonder.

Such places have only their intellectual integrity; when that falls, what are they left with other than their $51 billion endowment?

Let’s just use Harvard as a proxy for universities generally. How are they faring these days? Is the generation that is now in a position to decide to attend them—rather than develop an actual skill in a trade—and choose to give up four years and hundreds of thousands of dollars really going to take the bait?

It appears that this is seriously in doubt.The last of the last generation born in the 20th century, so-called Generation Z, has entered college and faces the decision to continue on the path or take a different route. It so happens that skills-based trades are paying huge salaries right now. That’s because there is a massive shortage of people who know how to do stuff.

This happens when you have fifty years in which millions have been trained to be one or another form of “intellectual” (or “mind worker”) even as the market for such “skills” has long been saturated.

Plus the job is awful in any case, contrary to what had long been promised.Most members of the professional managerial class of highly educated desk sitters are wholly miserable people. Most of their lives are spent following orders and fitting into the bureaucracy, with little or no creativity, much less adventure.All you get is a fancy title and some social status within some circles, and even that is changing.

As for academic jobs, truly, do you know a happy and wholly content professor or university administrator? I’ve personally never known any professional more willing to kvetch about his or her job, telling tales of amazing intrigue, perfidy, and backstabbery. One always wants to ask, “Why don’t you leave?” but we know the truth. There is nowhere to go. Academic jobs are hard to come by and extremely difficult to convert from one institution to another.

Such people have no other skills.

It’s about time that young people realize that there are other ways to pursue a career. We might finally have reached the point at which people are going their own way rather than following the prescribed path for the illusion of upward social mobility.

The Wall Street Journal (WSJ)reports:

“Long beset by a labor crunch, the skilled trades are newly appealing to the youngest cohort of American workers, many of whom are choosing to leave the college path. Rising pay and new technologies in fields from welding to machine tooling are giving trade professions a face-lift, helping them shed the image of being dirty, low-end work. Growing skepticism about the return on a college education, the cost of which has soared in recent decades, is adding to their shine.

“Enrollment in vocational training programs is surging as overall enrollment in community colleges and four-year institutions has fallen. The number of students enrolled in vocational-focused community colleges rose 16 percent last year to its highest level since the National Student Clearinghouse began tracking such data in 2018. The ranks of students studying construction trades rose 23 percent during that time, while those in programs covering HVAC and vehicle maintenance and repair increased 7 percent.”

Plus, come on, how cool is it to be a welder?That’s amazing. Same with being an electrician, a plumber, a cook, a builder, or just about anything else where you use your hands. These days, the money is great to accompany the adventure. Actually doing things seems to be gaining traction.

For the fourth year, “median annual pay for new construction hires has eclipsed earnings for new hires in both the professional services and information sectors—such as accountants or IT maintenance workers,” the WSJ reports.

Apparently, a major factor here driving this is the pandemic lockdowns in the following sense. Lots of kids saw their parents working from home for two years during this time. Seeing them sit at the dining room table and stare at screens all day, and then interact with colleagues only through more apps and platforms, and then finding out that this is precisely what they do at work all the time, kind of drained away the romance.

Who wants to do that? Let’s just say not everyone.

Plus, it is not unknown to white males that they are not exactly in high demand in a professional workplace beset by diversity, equity, and inclusion preferences for anyone but them. No one wants to be in a profession in which you are discriminated against—and denounced and shamed relentlessly—based on factors you cannot change, such as biology.

Why not get into a field that cares nothing about your sex and race and instead judges you by your skills and character?That seems far more appealing.

The WSJ further reports: “In a survey of high school and college-age people by software company Jobber last year, 75 percent said they would be interested in vocational schools offering paid, on-the-job training. The rise of generative AI is changing the career calculus for some young people. The majority of respondents Jobber surveyed said they thought blue-collar jobs offered better job security than white-collar ones, given the growth of AI.

“Nearly 80 percent of respondents in Jobber’s survey said their parents wanted them to go to college.Professions dominated by college-educated workers generally earn more over time. Professional and business services workers, for example, make a median $78,500 compared with $69,200 in construction, according to ADP.”

The point about parents is interesting. I’ve been predicting for decades that the college bubble would pop. But it hasn’t. The reason is parents. They want the best possible path forward for kids. They might not know for sure that a college degree will guarantee a good life, but surely it can help. Plus a degree is something they “can always fall back on.”

You know the line and the intuition. It’s a Boomer-born attitude that comes from the postwar experience with the GI Bill. An entire generation was led to believe that putting newly returned soldiers into college formed the basis of postwar prosperity and put millions into the middle class.

As a result, we’ve had generations of parents who have strongly recommended college to their kids. And they have been willing to pay the big bucks to make it possible, even once it became impossible to “work your way through college.” Parents just kept paying. And then the student loan market fired up to pick up the slack from what the parents could not afford. This saddled at least two generations with six-figure debts as they started their careers.

This entire calculation is a massive error.

What it forgets is that giving up four years between the ages of 18 and 22 sitting at a desk rather than gaining valuable career experience is a massive opportunity cost that comes at the prime of life. Indeed, it sets you back. Then if you end up in a lucrative profession, you still have to take vocational training in the form of professional certifications—the start of your actual education about which no one prepared you.

That’s the major cost of college: what you otherwise would be doing during those four years that you did not do. By comparison even with the dollar expense associated with tuition and books, that’s a huge cost. The ensuing debt, meanwhile, is an egregious way to start off a life.

What exactly would pop this bubble?It would take a generation of kids who decide to defy their own parents’ wishes and pursue a genuine skill rather than waste time memorizing what professors tell them and spitting it back on tests. Is that happening finally? It seems so.Apparently, it was the lockdowns that broke the spell. Kids look at their parents’ boring lives and have decided that they want to do something more interesting.

Good. This college stuff has been the rage since the end of World War II. Despite its persistence, it makes no sense. Before World War II, the pattern for men was to develop skills as a teen, finish one’s education with high school, and start being an adult. For women, it was the same, contrary to myth. They were typically fully employed until marriage and starting a family and then left the workplace to raise a family.

There were outliers, of course, but the pattern generally held, and it worked.As for college and intellectual pursuits, they grew up with civilization itself, but higher education was for a subset of the population that felt the call toward what we used to call the “life of the mind.” It makes no sense to universalize that calling by force.

There are other ways to have a good life besides being able to hang a degree on the wall. Indeed, that piece of paper might not amount to much at all, and come at too high a price.

2024-04-04 22:40:00,'Cocoa Could Double From Here' - Oil-Bull Andurand Gets Greedy On Chocolate,https://web.archive.org/web/20240405105559/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/oil-trader-andurand-gets-ballsy-cocoa-bull,"Oil trader Pierre Andurand suffered record losses last year in the commodities world, though the money manager has so far crushed it on the cocoa trade.

Bloombergreports Andurand opened a ""small, long position"" in cocoa futures in early March. Since then, prices have soared as much as 73%. People familiar with the trade did not specify where the famed oil trader opened the position or whether he'd taken profits.

Futures in New York have jumped as high as $10,300 a ton in recent weeks, surging from the $6,000 level in early March.

Andurand emailed Bloomberg that cocoa prices ""could break $20,000 later this year.""Hyperfinlating cocoa pricesare caused by drought and disease, which are ravaging the world's largest cocoa farms in West Africa.

Andurand said his analysts forecast cocoa bean production globally to be down at least 18% on the year, compared to most analysts' expectations of 10-11%.

""This means that we will finish the year with the lowest stocks-to-grinding ratio ever, and potentially run out of inventories late in the year,"" he warned.

The firm sees that ratio — which measures stockpiles relative to annual demand — will end the 2023-24 season around 16% in a base-case scenario.That would push the indicator below the previous record low set in the mid-1970s, when prices hit $5,000 a ton — equivalent to about $26,000 when adjusted for inflation, according to Bloomberg calculations.

Any higher cocoa prices and chocolate makers, like the US Hershey Company, will seedemand destruction. Soaring cocoa prices are already weighing on the company's stock.

This once-in-a-generation cocoa crisis will likely result in higher prices. Have the folks atr/WallStreetBetsfigured out about this trade?

""Similar results were observed in the high-risk subgroup(i.e., participants who had been vaccinated and had at least one risk factor for severe illness)and in the standard-risk subgroup(i.e., those who had no risk factors for severe illness and had never been vaccinated or had not been vaccinated within the previous 12 months),"" the authors added.

And while 0.8% of the Paxlovid group suffered 'hospitalization or death' vs. 1.6% of placebo recipients, the authors also concluded that it wasnot statistically significant, however placebo recipients had longer average hospital stays and were more likely to be admitted to intensive care units.

According to the authors, ""the usefulness of nirmatrelvir–ritonavir in patients who are not at high risk for severe COVID-19 has not been established.""

The trial included adults who had tested positive for COVID-19 and shown at least one symptom, hadpreviously received the COVID-19 vaccine, and had at least one risk factor - such as being a cigarette smoker.

Pfizer had previously announced thatthey were halting enrollment in the trialover ""a very low rate of hospitalization or death observed in the standard-risk patient population.""

Paxlovid was previously foundnot to reduce the riskof long COVID either.

As theEpoch Timesnotes, Dr. Vinay Prasad, an epidemiology professor at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved with the research, said on social media platform X that the trial showed Paxlovid ""doesn’t work in vaccinated people.""

""It was embarrassing to watch the administration and many ID doctors recommend this without any credible data,"" he continued - criticizing the government for spendingupwards of $12 billion for Paxlovid ""without much trial data.""

A previous Pfizer trial, which was run to assess Paxlovid’s efficacy and safetyamong the unvaccinated, found that Paxlovid shortened the time to sustained symptoms alleviation and reduced the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. The trial enrolled people with COVID-19, with symptoms, and who had a risk factor for progression to severe disease or were 60 years of age or older.

Based on the results from that trial, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2023 authorized the drug for both unvaccinated and vaccinated adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 who were deemed at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. -Epoch Times

""The benefit observed among unvaccinated high-risk persons does not extend to those at lower risk for severe COVID-19,"" wrote Drs. Rajesh Gandhi and Martin Hirsch inan editorialabout the new paper. That said, they also concluded that ""it still appears reasonable to recommend the drug to older people and people with substantial underlying conditions.""

2024-04-04 23:40:00,The Government Wants To Play God. What Does That Mean For Our Freedoms?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240405105559/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/government-wants-play-god-what-does-mean-our-freedoms#comment-stream,"Authored by John & Nisha Whitehead via The Rutherford Institute,

The government wants to play god.

It wants the power to decide who lives or dies and whose rights are worthy of protection.

Abortion may still be front and center in the power struggle between the Left and the Right over who has the right to decide—the government or the individual—when it comes to bodily autonomy, the right to privacy, sexual freedom, the rights of the unborn, and property interests in one’s body,but there’s so much more at play.

In the 50-plus years since the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark ruling inRoe v. Wade, the government has come to believe that it not only has the power to determine who is deserving of constitutional rights in the eyes of the law but it also has the authority to deny those rights to an American citizen.

This is how the abortion debate has played into the police state’s hands: by laying the groundwork for discussions about who else may or may not be deserving of rights.

Despite the Supreme Court having overturned its earlier rulings recognizing abortion as a constitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment, the government continues to play fast and loose with the lives of the citizenry all along the spectrum of life.

Take a good, hard look at the many ways in which Americans are being denied their rights under the Constitution.

American families who have their dogs shot, their homes trashed and their children terrorized or, worse,killed by errant SWAT team raidsin the middle of the night are being denied their rights under the Constitution.

Disabled individuals who are being strip searched, handcuffed, arrestedand “diagnosed” by police as dangerous or mentally unstable merely because they stutter and walk unevenly are being denied their rights under the Constitution.

School-aged children as young as 4-years-old who are leg shackled, handcuffed and strip searchedforviolating school zero tolerance policies by chewing a Pop Tart into the shape of a gunand playing an imaginary game of cops and robbers, or engaging in childish behavior such as crying or jumping are being denied their rights under the Constitution.

Unarmed citizens who are tasered or shot by policefor daring to hesitate, stutter, move a muscle, flee or disagree in any way with a police order are being denied their rights under the Constitution.

Likewise,Americans—young and old alike—who areshot by police because they pointed a garden hoseat a police officer, reached for their registration in their glove box, relied upon a cane to steady themselves, or were seen playing with air rifles or BB guns are being denied their rights under the Constitution.

Female motorists who are unlucky enough to be pulled over for a questionable traffic infraction only to be subjected by police tocavity searches by the side of the roadare being denied their rights under the Constitution.

Male pedestrians and motorists alike who are being subjected toroadside strip searches and rectal probesby police based largely on the color of their skin are being denied their rights under the Constitution.

Americancitizens subjected to government surveillancewhereby their phone calls are being listened in on, their mail and text messages read, their movements tracked and their transactions monitored are being denied their rights under the Constitution.

Homeowners who are being fined and arrested for raising chickens in their backyard,allowing the grass in their front yards to grow too long, and holding Bible studies in their homes are being denied their rights under the Constitution.

Decorated military veterans who are beingarrested for criticizing the government on social mediasuch as Facebook are being denied their rights under the Constitution.

Homeless individuals who are being harassed, arrested and run out of towns bylaws that criminalize homelessnessare being denied their rights under the Constitution.

Individuals whoseDNA has been forcibly collected and entered into federal and state law enforcement databaseswhether or not they have been convicted of any crime are being denied their rights under the Constitution.

Drivers whoselicense plates are being scanned,uploaded to a police database and used to map their movements, whether or not they are suspected of any crime, are being denied their rights under the Constitution. The same goes fordrivers who are being ticketed for running afoul of red light cameraswithout any real opportunity to defend themselves against such a charge are being denied their rights under the Constitution.

Protesters andactivists who are being labeled domestic terrorists and extremistsand accused of hate crimes for speaking freely are being denied their rights under the Constitution. Likewise, American citizens who beingtargeted for assassination by drone strikes abroadwithout having been charged, tried and convicted of treason are being denied their rights under the Constitution.

Hard-working Americans whosebank accounts, homes, cars electronics and cash are seized by police(operating according to asset forfeiture schemes that provide profit incentives for highway robbery) are being denied their rights under the Constitution.

So, what is the common denominator here?

These are all American citizens—endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, rights that no person or government can take away from them, among these the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness—and they are all being oppressed in one way or another by a government that has grown drunk on power, money and its own authority.

If the government—be it the President, Congress, the courts or any federal, state or local agent or agency—can decide that any person hasnorights, then that person becomes less than a citizen, less than human, less than deserving of respect, dignity, civility and bodily integrity. He or she becomes an “it,” a faceless number that can be tallied and tracked, a quantifiable mass of cells that can be discarded without conscience, an expendable cost that can be written off without a second thought, or an animal that can be bought, sold, branded, chained, caged, bred, neutered and euthanized at will.

It’s a slippery slope that justifies all manner of violations in the name of national security, the interest of the state and the so-called greater good.

Yet those who founded this country believed that what we conceive of as our rights were given to us by God—we are created equal, according to the nation’s founding document, the Declaration of Independence—and that government cannot create, nor can it extinguish our God-given rights. To do so would be to anoint the government with god-like powers and elevate it above the citizenry.

Unfortunately, we have been dancing with this particular devil for quite some time now.

If we continue to wait for the government to restore our freedoms, respect our rights, rein in its abuses and restrain its agents from riding roughshod over our lives, our liberty and our happiness, then we will be waiting forever.

The highly politicized tug-of-war over abortion will not resolve the problem of a culture that values life based on a sliding scale.  Nor will it help us navigate the moral, ethical and scientific minefields that await us as technology and humanity move ever closer to a point of singularity.

Humanity is being propelled at warp speed into a whole new frontier when it comes to privacy, bodily autonomy, and what it means to be a human being. As such, we haven’t even begun to wrap our heads around how present-day legal debates over bodily autonomy, privacy, vaccine mandates, the death penalty, and abortion play into future discussions about singularity, artificial intelligence, cloning, and the privacy rights of the individual in the face of increasingly invasive, intrusive and unavoidable government technologies.

Yet here is what I know.

Life is an inalienable right.

By allowing the government to decide who or what is deserving of rights, it shifts the entire discussion from one in which we are “endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights” (that of life, liberty property and the pursuit of happiness) to one in which only those favored by the government get to enjoy such rights.

If all people are created equal, then all lives should be equally worthy of protection.

At the meeting, ministers discussed how to put assistance to Ukraine on a firmer and more permanent footing in the future.

“All Allies agree on the need to support Ukraine in this critical moment.There is a unity of purpose,”said Stoltenberg.

He stressed that “The people of Ukraine continue to defend their country with skill and bravery” and that“the Ukrainians are not running out of courage, they are running out of ammunition.”

He added that “We need to step up now to ensure our support is built to last.”

The Norwegian leader of NATO said details of the initiative would emerge in the coming weeks.

“We are now in the process of developing a more robust and enduring, institutionalised framework for support to Ukraine, that our support is less dependent on voluntary short term offers and more on long term NATO commitments,”said the secretary general.

He expressed the hope that now that allies have begun to discuss planning, a decision on the final form of assistance could be taken at the NATO summit in Washington in July.

Stoltenberg said that taking responsibility for aid to Ukraine would not make NATO a party to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

“NATO is and will remain a defensive Alliance. And NATO is, and will remain, not a party to the conflict in Ukraine.We need to remember what this is. This is war or aggression by Russia invading another country, violating international law.And then Ukraine has the right, according to international law, to defend itself,” he said.

He also pointed out that Russia is receiving support for its war of aggression from China, North Korea, and Iran.

“As authoritarian powers increasingly align, it is important that like-minded nations around the world stand together. To defend a global order ruled by law, not by force,”Stoltenberg added.

Researchers at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL)utilize liquid lithium coating in fusion reactor vessels to optimize fueling and enhance plasma stability.

Findings published in Nuclear Fusion highlight the importance of neutral particle density at the edge of plasma for maintaining stability and efficient fusion reactions.

Ongoing research aims torefine methods for sustaining fusion reactions over prolonged periods, paving the way for practical fusion energy production.

Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory researchersfound the promise of coating the inner surface of the vessel containing a fusion plasma in liquid lithium guides them toward the best practices for fueling their plasmas.

The research, which is featured in a new paper inNuclear Fusion,includes observations, numerical simulations and analysis from their experiments insidea fusion plasma vesselcalled the Lithium Tokamak Experiment-Beta (LTX-β). (Please note, there is a dearth of attention grabbing media available for this post, however,the research paper at posting isnotbehind a paywall.)

One team at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) has been asking themselves lately as a metaphor,“How much fuel can we add to the fire while still maintaining control?”

Now, they believe they have the answer for one particular scenario. It’s all a part of the Lab’s work to bring energy from fusion to the power grid.

Building upon recent findings showing the promise of coating the inner surface of the vessel containing a fusion plasma inliquid lithium, the researchers have determined the maximum density of uncharged, or neutral, particles at the edge of a plasma before the edge of the plasma cools off and certain instabilities become unpredictable. Knowing the maximum density for neutral particles at the edge of a fusion plasma is important because it gives the researchers a sense of how and how much to fuel the fusion reaction.

The LTX-βis one of many fusion vessels around the world that holds plasma in a donut shape using magnetic fields. Such vessels are known as tokamaks. What makes this tokamak special is that its inner walls can be coated, almost completely, in lithium. This fundamentally changes the wall behavior, as the lithium holds on to a very high percentage of the hydrogen atoms coming off the plasma. Without the lithium, far more hydrogen would bounce off the walls and back into the plasma. In early 2024, the research team reported that this low recycling environment for hydrogen keeps the very edge of the plasma hot, making the plasma more stable and providing room for a larger volume of plasma.

Richard Majeski, a managing principal research physicist at PPPL and head of LTX-βsaid,“We are trying to show that a lithium wall can enable a smaller fusion reactor, which will translate into a higher power density.” Ultimately, this research could translate into the cost-effective fusion power source the world needs.

With the new paper the LTX-βteam has published additional findings showing the relationship between the fuel for the plasma and its stability. Specifically, the researchers found the maximum density of neutral particles at the edge of a plasma inside LTX-βbefore the edge starts to cool, potentially leading to stability problems. The researchers believe they can reduce the likelihood of certain instabilities by keeping the density at the edge of the plasma below their newly defined level of 1 x 1019 m-3. This is the first time such a level has been established for LTX-β, and knowing it is a big step in their mission to prove lithium is the ideal choice for an inner-wall coating in a tokamak because it guides them toward the best practices for fueling their plasmas.

In LTX-β, the fusion is fueled in two ways: using puffs of hydrogen gas from the edge and a beam of neutral particles. Researchers are refining how to use both methods in tandem to create an optimal plasma that will sustain fusion for a long time in future fusion reactors while generating enough energy to make it practical for the power grid.

Physicists often compare the temperature at its edge to its core temperature to assess how easy it will be to manage. They plot these numbers on a graph and consider the slope of the line. If the temperature at the inner core and outer edge are nearly the same, the line is almost flat, so they call that a flat temperature profile. If the temperature at the outer edge is significantly lower than the temperature at the inner core, scientists call it a peaked temperature profile.

Santanu Banerjee, a staff research physicist at PPPL and lead author on the new paper explained, “The team determined the maximum density of neutral particles beyond the edge of a plasma that still allows for a flat-edge temperature profile. Going beyond that number of neutrals at the edge definitely will drop your edge temperature, and you will end up in a peaked temperature profile.”

“That same neutral density is the threshold for instabilities known as tearing modes. Beyond that density, tearing modes tend to get destabilized, cause threats to the plasma and may stop the fusion reaction if left uncontrolled,” he added.

If the instabilities become too large, the fusion reaction will end. In order to support the power grid, researchers are figuring out the best ways to manage a fusion plasma so that the reaction is stable.

Banerjee and Majeski worked with several other researchers on the paper, including PPPL’s Dennis Boyle, Anurag Maan, Nate Ferraro, George Wilkie, Mario Podesta and Ron Bell.

Meanwhile work on the project continues. PPPL engineer Dylan Corl is optimizing the direction in which the neutral beam, which is used to heat the plasma, is injected into the tokamak. “We’re basically creating a new port for it,” Corl said. He uses a 3D model of the LTX-β, testing different beam trajectories to ensure the beam won’t hit another part of the equipment, such as tools used to measure the plasma. “Finding the best angle has been a challenge, but I believe we’ve got it now,” Corl said.

This is a fascinating account of one part of the effort to contain a plasma at temperatures and pressures needed for a fusion reaction.  The idea of the tokamak has, for your humble writer, been a something of a bewilderment. The surface area of a donut vs say a simple sphere is well . . . And compressing the shape seems well . . . The tokamak shape seems to amplify the problems. However, your humble writer is no kind of expert in these matters.

Thus everything developed is interesting to the point of fascination. The best case is the tokamak will be a power producer someday. If now, the effort is going to turn up a whole lot of knowledge and knowhow that might enable other concepts or designs.

Fusion on earth is a long, long, long reach. We’re getting there with each grasp of new understanding and knowhow.

2024-04-05 03:30:00,"""You Try Living With Them"" - Botswana Offers 20,000 Elephants To Germany",https://web.archive.org/web/20240405105559/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/you-try-living-them-botswana-offers-20000-elephants-germany#comment-stream,"Authored by Thomas Brooke via ReMix News,

Botswana has offered to send 20,000 elephants to Berlin, telling Germany’s left-wing government it should try living with the mammals before pushing trophy hunting bans on African countries.

Calls by Germany’s Federal Environment Minister Steffi Lemke forbans on trophy hunting have been met with stiff opposition in Botswana’s capital of Gaborone, with political leaders insisting that hunting, when done sustainably, helps to protect crops and villages from being destroyed and boosts tourism to developing countries.

Speaking to the Bild newspaper, Botswanan President Mokgweetsi Masisi said his country was suffering from an elephant plague after recent conservation efforts, and the Botswanan people are dependent on some of the animals being culled through controlled and “sustainable” hunting.

“We are paying the price for preserving these animals for the world,”Masisi told the German tabloid, explaining it wasvery easy for left-wing politicians like Lemke of the Green party “to sit in Berlin and have an opinion about our affairs in Botswana.”

He explained that his government had already offloaded 8,000 of the animals to nearby Angola due to their exploding population, and threatened to send 20,000 elephants to Berlin so German politicians can “live together with the animals in the way you are trying to tell us to.”

“We would like to make such an offer to the Federal Republic of Germany. We don’t take no for an answer. 20,000 wild elephants for Germany. This is not a joke,”Masisi warned.

There are now over 130,000 wild elephants living across Botswana, and the government has reserved 40 percent of the country’s landscape for protected wildlife — a move that comes at a considerable economic price.

This type of deportation of these wild animals has happened before.For example, the Namibian government transported around 150 wild elephants to Cuba by plane in 2013 and flew 22 to the United Arab Emirates in 2022.

Maxi Louis of the Nature Reserve and Conservancy Association (NACSO) in Namibia told Bild: “We have not yet transported 20,000 elephants, but we are very confident that a country like Germany in particular can carry out this elephant transport successfully.”

“The best place to hand over the elephants to Ms. Lemke is on open farmland outside of Berlin, where there are grain crops. The elephants will then have something to eat,”she added in jest.

Due to the sanctions, Russia cannot access spare parts from Western engineering companies that have provided refinery equipment in the past, leaving Russian refiners struggling to repair damaged units, multiple industry sources in Russia have toldReuters.

Western firms including America’s UOP and Swiss ABB have supplied parts and equipment to major Russian refineries in the past. After the invasion of Ukraine, they no longer fulfill new orders from Russia, leaving local engineers scrambling to find spare parts and equipment.

One example of such difficulty is Lukoil’s Norsi refinery in Nizhny Novgorod on the Volga River.A turbine malfunctioned there in early January and Russian engineers have struggled to have the equipment replaced since then, according to Reuters sources.

This has left the refinery with a reduced capacity to produce gasoline.

The malfunction at the refinery compounded last month aftera fire broke outat the facility following a drone attack.

Since all major Russian refineries use at least some part of Western technology, they could struggle to repair equipment and units that broke down or have been damaged by Ukrainian drone attacks,which have intensified in recent weeks and have taken anestimated 14%of Russia’s refining capacity offline.

Russia claims it can repair all damaged units within two months.

On Wednesday, Russia’s Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov said that all damaged refineries in the country would be restarted by the beginning of June.

“Repairs are underway at the refineries. We plan to re-launch a number of refineries after repairs in April-May, possibly before the beginning of June,” Russian news agencyInterfaxquoted Shulginov as saying.

“All facilities that were damaged will be re-commissioned,” the minister added.

""I have lost trust in the chief of defense,"" Troels Lund Poulsen, Denmark’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, told reporters on Wednesday night. Poulsen reportedly learned about the failure from the Danish military outletOlfi.

""We are facing a historic and necessary strengthening of Denmark’s defense forces. This places great demands on our organization and on the military advice at a political level,"" the Danish official added.

On March 9, the Iver Huitfeldt's air defense systemsfailed for 30 minutes while engaging Yemeni attackslaunched by Houthis in support of Gaza, according to a leaked document written by the ship’s commanding officer and reviewed byOlfi. The document also reported issues with the ship’s ammunition system, which caused half of its rounds to detonate before they hit their target.

""Our clear understanding is thatthe issue has been known for years without the necessary sense of urgency to resolve the problem,"" the frigate's commanding officer reported.

The Iver Huitfeldt eventually fended off the attack, shooting down four drones over the Red Sea in what –at the time – was presented as a success story.

Lentfer's firing is the latest in a string ofrecent public embarrassments from NATO member states, particularly in the Red Sea, where a months-long campaign of US and UK airstrikes inside Yemen has failed to deter attacks against Israeli-linked vessels.

""We favor a diplomatic solution; we know that there is no military solution,"" US Special Envoy for YemenTimothy Lenderkingsaid on Wednesday from Oman, candidly acknowledging the failure of what US military commanders called Washington'slargest naval battle since WWII.

Other recent mishaps for NATO includeGermany’suse of obsolete communications systems and unsecured lines to discuss providing Ukraine with cruise missiles and Britain'sfailuretwice in a row to test its nuclear missiles after having two of its flagship aircraft carriersbreak downahead of drills in Norway.

The steep drops reported in Q1 2024 are the latest sign that consumer appetite for fully electric vehicles has slowed,prompting both companies to escalate their ongoing price war. In February 2024, BYD responded to Tesla’s repeated price cuts with its own round of discounts.

As shown in the above graphic, starting prices for some of BYD’s electric cars are incredibly low.

In China, the BYDSeagullnow starts at 69,800 yuan ($9,700), while theYuan Plus(BYD’s Model Y competitor) starts at 119,800 yuan ($16,000). On the other hand, Tesla’s cheapest model (RWD Model 3) costs 245,900 yuan ($34,000). It’s interesting to note that the cheapest Model 3 in the U.S. costs $38,990, according to reporting fromCNN.

2024-04-05 06:30:00,Federal Reserve Refuses To Provide Records Of Foreign Gold Holdings,https://web.archive.org/web/20240405105559/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/federal-reserve-refuses-provide-records-foreign-gold-holdings,"Authored by Ken Silva via Money Metals,

Weeks afterFederal ReserveChairmanJerome Powellevaded a sitting congressman’s questions about the central bank’s foreign gold holdings,the Fed has also declined to comply with a Freedom of Information Act request for records about such holdings.

The Federal Reserve’s lack of transparency comes amidst reports that countries are removing theirgoldand other assets from the U.S. in the wake of the unprecedented Western sanctions imposed onRussiaover its invasion ofUkraine. According to a2023 Invesco survey,a “substantial percentage” of central banks expressed concern about how the U.S. and its allies froze nearly half of Russia’s $650 billion gold and forex reserves.

Rep.Alex Mooney, R-W.Va., asked Powell about the matter in aDecember letter, only to have the Fed chair respond last month withevasive non-answers, telling him that the Federal Reserve does not own gold but holds it as a custodian for other entities—a fact that the congressman presumably already knew.

Following Powell’s evasive response,Headline USA filed a FOIA request with the Fed for records reflecting how much gold the Federal Reserve Bank of New York currently holds in its vault,as well as records reflecting the ownership stake that each of FRBNY’s central bank/government clients have in that gold. The FOIA request also sought records about the Fed’s gold holdings prior to Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

However,the Federal Reserve denied the FOIA request on Wednesday.

“Board staff consulted with staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (‘Reserve Bank’) and have been advised that such records, if they exist, would be Reserve Bank records, and consequently, not subject to the Board’s Rules Regarding Availability of Information,” the Fed said.

The Federal Reserve said that this publication could take its request to the New York Fed. However, that institution isn’t subject to FOIA.

Headline USAis working on an appeal.

Meanwhile,sound-money advocates are blasting the Fed’s lack of transparency.

“They’re just passing the buck to the New York Fed. The FRB could obtain the data from the New York Fed if it wanted to, and then could share it with you if it wanted to. The Fed chairman has already essentially told Representative Mooney that the Fed doesn’t want to disclose the information,” said Chris Powell, secretary-treasurer of theGold Anti-Trust Action Committee.

“If only other news organizations dared to ask such relevant questions about the secret operations of the Federal Reserve System,” he said.

According toStefan Gleason, CEO of Money Metals Exchange, a large online precious metals dealer and depository based in Idaho, ""The Fed doesn't want anyone to know that foreign governments and other central banks are yanking their gold from America's shores because it would reveal the folly of U.S. monetary and foreign policy.""

2024-04-05 06:55:00,Biden DOE Slaps Energy Efficiency Regulations On Key Power Grid Components,https://web.archive.org/web/20240405105559/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/biden-doe-slaps-energy-efficiency-regulations-key-power-grid-components,"The Bide administration hasfinalized energy efficiency regulationsfor distribution transformers, a key component of managing the flow of electricity between power stations and consumers.

In a Thursday morning announcement, the Department of Energy said that the regulations wouldhelp accelerate the green agendaas part of the administration's ""commitment to tackling the climate crisis"" (and causing more inflation).

The agency suggested that the move wouldsaveutilities and businesses over $824 million per year in electricity costs (once they come out of pocket for the 'necessary' upgrades).

""These standards are going to make America's power grid more resilient,"" said DOE Secretary Jennifer Granholm, adding ""They'll support good-paying, high-quality manufacturing jobs, and they'll help us deploy more affordable and reliable and clean electricity more quickly across the country.""

""It's going to provide critical, long-term certainty for domestic manufacturing and production investments– it's going to strengthen energy and economic supply chain security,"" she continued, adding ""And it'll position American producers and workers to capture an evolving and growing market.""

Granholm also emphasized that theenergy efficiency standardswill slash nearly 85 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of the combined annual emissions of 11 million U.S. homes.

Under DOE's regulations,energy efficiency gains will be achieved with 75% of the transformers on the market being manufactured with grain-oriented electrical steel (GOES)and another25% being manufactured with amorphous alloy, a lesser-used electric steel core material.Manufacturers will be given five years to ensure total compliance with the regulations.-Fox News

The new standards are a scaled-down version of regulations first proposed by the DOE in January 2023, under which 95% of distribution transformers would have been required to be made with amorphous alloy, and manufacturers would have three years to comply.

The original proposal has been widely criticized by power providers and utility companies which said it's unrealistic, leading to bipartisan legislation introduced by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) which would require the DOE to preserve market opportunities for transformer manufacturers.

Brown said that GOES accounts for more than 95% of the domestic distribution transformer market, while amorphous steel relies onforeign materials, while there's just one small producer in the US. Therefore, per Brown, rapidly ramping up reliance on amorphous steel could create a vulnerability in the US power grid.

""The final rule provides stability for most of the market, while affording a more gradual shift toward tighter efficiency standards for transformers used to meet larger commercial and certain electrification loads,"" said  Louis Finkel, the senior vice president of government relations for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA).

In a press release,Cleveland-Cliffsapplauded the rule,sayingin a statement that ""Cleveland-Cliffs and the United Auto Workers (UAW) worked collaboratively to educate the DOE on the shortcomings of the originally proposed distribution transformer rule and the danger of relying on Amorphous Metal, which is produced in very limited volumes and exclusively from imported materials.""

The rate of payroll growth is expected to cool in March, and come in below recent averages. As Newsquawk notes, labor market proxies have been mixed in the month: ADP surprised to the upside, there was a small tick higher in initial jobless claims and continuing claims; business surveys registered improvement in employment conditions in March although still remain in contraction; JOLTs data was inline with expectations, and shows a still sturdy labor market even if the number of quits has slumped. More to the point, Chair Powell recently said that ""It would take an unexpected deterioration in the labor market for the Fed to consider rate cuts sooner"" and that is not a scenario that he currently sees; on the other side, Powell also suggested that hotter than expected jobs growth was not necessarily something that could stoke inflation, given the growth in labor supply (read: the ongoing surge in illegal immigration). That said, with Biden getting increasing pushback from the radical left such as Elizabeth Warren, to slash rates,we would not be at all surprised if the BLS has finally gotten a tap on the shoulder and we get a ""shock"" sub-100K print tomorrow.

The former bodyguard of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’ claims the music mogul had blackmail tapes of politicians, princes and other prominent individuals who were involved in his sex parties.

Combs, who has been hit with a barrage of physical abuse, rape and sexual trafficking allegations, had his homes in Miami and Los Angeles raided by the Department of Homeland Security last month, during which federal agents seized computers and other electronic devices.

Gene Deal, who was present the night when Notorious B.I.G. was fatally shot in 1997, made the sensational comments during an interview with ‘The Art of Dialogue’ YouTube channel.

NEW: Diddy’s former bodyguard Gene Deal suggests that Diddy may have tapes of politicians, princes and even preachers which could now be in the hands of the feds.“I don't think it's only celebrities gonna be shook. He had politicians in there, he had princes in there. He also…pic.twitter.com/hheJPwrKMe

“I don’t think it’s only celebrities gonna be shook. He had politicians in there, he had princes in there. He also had a couple of preachers in there,”said Deal.

“Can you imagine, he had every room bugged,”he added.

When asked why Combs’ media department had stayed silent on the allegations against him, Deal responded, “Either they took part in some of the stuff that happened, or they’re scared that it may mess up their brand.”

Fox News host Jesse Watters speculated that the tapes, if they exist, are now in the hands of the feds and “that’s a lot of blackmail.”

Deal’s comments echo those of rapper Rodney ‘Lil Rod’ Jones, who claimed Combs had hidden cameras throughout his home to record sex tapes involving celebrities during his “freak off” parties.

Combs has denied all the allegations against him and hasn’t been hit with any criminal charges as of yet.

""Meanwhile, Goldshouldbe higher if stocks are higher. bondsshould yield moreas things recalibrate."" 9:05a.m.

UPDATE:Began writing this at 9a.m. read the footnote for context, as gold is now up $30!1

The Jobs number came in strong, but stocks did not react as if it implied the Fed would be stingy. This, despite bonds reacting that way. Stocks kept rallying (as of this writing) even as bonds cratered more. Gold also dropped a little. This makes no sense.

Trying to make sense of it all.

As far as that Bond/Stock relationship goes:

Just as many correlations are now broken, expectations of market influence should also be re-calibrated. For example: Who drives the market more, Fed or Treasury?

It may be time to seriously re-adjust the coefficients we feel these two economic drivers have on the economy.

The Fed just does not matter in the shadow of all this fiscal driven stimulus.. going back to theAnti-goldilocksstuff...which we stand by as essentially giving a name to concepts Zoltan Pozsar illuminated us on.

But the planned immigration, and the fabricated govt jobs are keeping the stagflation (inflation side of it anyway) at bay. Analogously:

In the 1970s Fed was the (shitty) brakes and Treasury/Fiscal was the (sloppy) non-specific gas.

Now same roles have returned, except weakened unions compared to then (while ""back"" are nowhere where they were then,) and immigration is keeping labor costs in check.

Industry-wise it all fits with a shrinking financial upper-middle class, and reborn blue collar lower-middle class.

A generation of affluent middle class is being slowly wound down while a new one is maybe given a chance to be born. just like the 1980s gave us (with much pain for my family)

The whole economy is being reset from financial services to manufacturing again ( as statedin this spacealso 2 years ago and many times afterwards), and either the gov’t learned from past errors (and are trying not to make new ones), or the other shoe just hasn’t dropped yet.

Probably both are true.

Meanwhile, Goldshouldbe higher if stocks are higher. bondsshouldyield more as things recalibrate.

And as Mercantilism goes, it has to be the pullback position now while we get our own house in order. Without Gold and the ability to at lease co-exist as rancorous neighbors, World War 3 would start.

P.S.- I realize everything stated above plays into the “American exceptionalism” meme going around. That phrase is a manufactured soundbite that tries to harness nationalistic pride ( we have no nationalism now due to years of sown division, and that is what is helping China etc stay unified) without engendering ethnocentric behavior. But it’s not wrong

P.P.S.- I also realize with the diminished power of the Fed comes the risk of the MMT types again who believe rates do not matter and all things can be solved with taxing and bonds. They are wrong

2024-04-05 12:05:00,Behind Today's Stellar Jobs Print: It Was Literally ALL Part-Time Jobs (And Illegals),https://web.archive.org/web/20240406124235/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/behind-todays-stellar-jobs-print-it-was-literally-all-part-time-jobs-and-illegals,"First things first: unlike the last two months when both theJanuaryandFebruaryjobs prints were beyond ridiculously manipulated and goalseeked to pass a terrible number as a strong one, the March print was not a complete disaster.

To be sure, superficially the March report was another artificially goalseeked blowout that guaranteed it would have zero credibility: with 303K payrolls added which was a 4 sigma beat to the median estimate of 214K and above the highest Wall Street forecast. There is just one problem:the number of multiple-sigma beats in recent months has been so high, the entire concept of ""beats"" has become laughable.

Consider this: January was a 5-sigma beat to expectations; February was a 3-sigma beat and March, we just learned, beat the median estimate by 4-sigma. Not only that, but in every of the last 3 months, the actual payrolls number (at least before it was revised lower the next month), has come in higher than the highest Wall Street estimate! We kinda feel bad for Biden trying so hard to manipulate the economy and population into liking Bidenomics and approving of his disastrous economic policies. Maybe he should just report one month that jobs rose by 10,000,000 and sit back and wait for his approval rating to hit 100... or something.

The silver lining, is that unlike previous months when the Household Survey reported sharp drops in the number of actually employed workers, in March,employment finally rose by 498K to 161.466 million, the first monthly increase in the past 4 months.

Still, despite the modest rebound in employment, it still lags payrolls by almost 9 million jobs since the covid trough.

However, that's where the mitigating factors end, because while there was some improvement in the quantitative aspect of the March report, when it comes to the qualitative aspect, it was another disaster for one simple reason:all the job gains were part time jobs!

Here isexhibit A: in March, thenumber of part-time jobs soared by 691K to 28.632 million, up from 27.941 millionwhile full-time jobs dropped by 6,000, to 132.940 millionfrom 132.946 million.

This number only gets scarier when we extend the period to the past year: as shown in the next chart, since March 2023,the number of full-time workers has collapsed by 1.347 million while the number of part-time workers exploded by 1.888 million!

Regular readers are aware that all the job gains since 2018 have gone to immigrants, mostly illegal immigrants, something we spent lastmonth's jobs post discussingin detail.

So what happened in March? It will come as no surprise that there was more of the same, and after the collapse in native-born workers in the last three months when nearly 2.5 million native-born workers lost their jobs, March saw some pick up, and 929K native-born workers were added. Meanwhile, after last month's record increase in foreign-born workers, in March illegal immigrants added another 112K jobs,pushing the total number of foreign-born workers to a new record high of 31.114 million.

Said otherwise, not only has all job creation in the past 6 years has been exclusively for foreign-born workers...

... but there has been zero job-creation for native born workers since July 2018!

This, as we have been saying for months now, is a huge issue - especially at a time of an illegal alien flood at the southwest border...

... and is about to become a huge political scandal, because once the inevitable recession finally hits, there will be millions of furious unemployed Americans demanding a more accurate explanation for what happened - i.e., the illegal immigration floodgates that were opened by the Biden admin.

To this point, we are delighted to observe that aftereveryonehad been ignoring what we have been saying for months, namely that all job growth has gone to illegals...

How is this not the biggest political talking point right now: since October 2019, native-born US workers have lost 1.4 million jobs; over the same period foreign-born workers have gained 3 million jobs.pic.twitter.com/Z5HVWmQ24C

... overnight none other than Goldman admitted that not only has all job growth in recent years gone to illegal immigrants, but that America is now being invaded. Below we excerpt from the note from Goldman economist Elsie Peng, who amusingly calls illegal aliens ""unauthorized immigrants""in her note (available to pro subsin the usual place):

Net US immigration surged in 2023. Recent reports from the Congressional Budget Office and border encounter data from the Office of Homeland Security suggest that net US immigration was running above the estimate implied by the change in the foreign-born population in the household survey over the last couple of years.We estimate that net US immigration surged to roughly 2.5 million in 2023, the highest level in the last two decades(Exhibit 1). In today’s note, we look at where recent immigrants are coming from, what parts of the US they are heading to, and how they compare to the rest of the US labor force.

Unauthorized immigrants from South America, Central America, and Mexico have accounted for most of the recent surge in immigration. Using immigration court case data,we estimate that the number of unauthorized immigrants from these three regions likely tripled in 2023 from its pre-pandemic average(left side of Exhibit 2). We note that these estimates of unauthorized immigration inflow carry some degree of uncertainty because some immigration court cases also reflect visa overstays. In contrast, the overall level and origin composition of authorized immigrants is similar to pre-pandemic trends (right side of Exhibit 2).

Where are they going? According to Goldman, the most popular destination states for new immigrants are Florida, California, Texas, and New York, which together have received over 50% of recent immigrants.

And the punchline, or how the establishment is trying to spin the flood of illegals into a positive feature for the US economy: apparently all these illegals are little gifts from god, keeping wages low and taking jobs that nobody else would ever want.

Data from the 2023 Current Population Survey suggest that recent adult immigrants are more likely to be young or prime age (90%) than the native-born adult population (62%) or adult immigrants who arrived earlier (64%).Recent immigrants have a higher labor force participation rate than the native-born population but a lower rate than immigrants who have been in the US for longer,have a higher unemployment rate than either group, are more likely to work in construction and food services and accommodations, and earn significantly lower wages on average.

This is hardly a surprise: none other than Fed Chair Powell fired the starting gun one month agowhen in his 60 Minutes interview he effectively said Americans are lazy and that it was the illegals that have been critical in keep wages lowereven as jobs have grown substantially in the past year (at least according to the Establishment survey). Recall this exchange from the interview:

PELLEY: Why was immigration important?

POWELL: Because, you know, immigrants come in, and they tend to work at a rate that is at or above that for non-immigrants. Immigrants who come to the country tend to be in the workforce at a slightly higher level than native Americans do. But that's largely because of the age difference. They tend to skew younger.

PELLEY: Why is immigration so important to the economy?

POWELL: Well, first of all, immigration policy is not the Fed's job. The immigration policy of the United States is really important and really much under discussion right now, and that's none of our business. We don't set immigration policy. We don't comment on it.

I will say, over time, though, the U.S. economy has benefited from immigration.And, frankly, just in the last, yeara big part of the story of the labor market coming back into better balance is immigration returning to levels that were more typical of the pre-pandemic era.

PELLEY: The country needed the workers.

POWELL: It did. And so, that's what's been happening.

But that's not all: just in case praising illegal immigration wasn't enough to keeping wage growth low (completely ignoring that all these millions in illegals will require trillions in additional welfare spending, and are the primary beneficiaries of the latest explosion in US debt), there has been a second angle this time courtesy of the CBO which recently hilarious ""calculated"" that illegal immigrants will boost US GDP by $7 trillion in the next decade.

This is how CBO Director Phill Swagel summarized it: ""as a result of those changes in the labor force, we estimate that from 2023 to 2034, GDP will be greater by about $7 trillion and revenue will be greater by about $1 trillion than they would have been otherwise.""

And there you have it: yes, the US hasn't added any jobs to native-born Americans in six years, as instead all jobs have gone to immigrants, mostly the illegal variety, but that's good news you see, because if it wasn't for these lovely creatures flooding into the US, wages would be higher (that's a bad thing according to the Fed), and the US economy would not grow by $9 trillion. Just please ignore that that $9 trillion in ""growth"" will comeonly thanks to $20 trillion in debt, almost all of it soaked up by these same illegals, and of course, a handful of corrupt, embezzling politicians.

And so the scene has been set: if and when Trump or Republicans finally get their act together and halt the flood of illegals, then and only then, will the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis admit just how ugly the US economy, the labor market and inflation truly are... and then they will blame Trump for pushing the US into a stagflationary recession because he halted the record inflow of immigrants without which the US is - drumroll - doomed.

The latest updates on the “new normal” – chronicling the lies, distortions, and abuses by the ruling class.

“I don’t remember talking about masks at all,” says Bill Gates.

The excellent montage below then cuts to numerous clips of Gates nerding out with his spaghetti-noodle-arm routine, orgasming about the purported benefits of masks (all lies, we now know).

In one clip, he muses about mask requirements being akin to requiring people wear pants in public.

This is the glory of the free internet, and why the technocrats hate it: in the before times, a lowly creature like Bill Gates, or the Brandon entity, or Fauci, could get away with telling brazen lies because exposing them would require untold amounts of legwork that normal people didn’t have time for and controlled media didn’t have any interest in.

Now, with a meager internet connection anywhere in the world, one can pull up damning clips within a matter of seconds, splice them together using free software, and,voila, you have a viral Twitter/X montage for the world to enjoy exposing the lies of a lying, scheming psychopath.

Let’s appreciate it while it lasts.

The needle-arm NPC meme is going to need a lot more needles to keep up with all the Current Thing™ mRNA injections coming down the pike.

How’s this for a business model:

·       You create a lucrative experimental injection

·       You bribe relevant government officials at a fraction of the ultimate profit margin to get it rushed through the regulatory process

·       You get it mandated by holding the ability to work, go to school, or even shop at grocery stores hostage

·       You then develop a new lucrative experimental injection to treat the conditions induced by the last experimental injection

·       Repeat processad nauseam

It’s pharmaceutical fairy-tale storytime with, as the kids say, the “receipts.”

“Shares of Moderna MRNA rose 3% on Wednesday after management announced positive clinical updatesat its Vaccines Day Event, highlighting its pipeline progress.

While the company provided an update on multiple pipeline candidates,it announced its decision to advance three vaccinesto pivotal late-stage development.These include mRNA-1189 (for Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]), mRNA-1468 (for Varicella-Zoster virus [VZV]) and mRNA-1405 (for norovirus).

The decision to advance these candidates is based on data from separate early-stage clinical studies on these vaccines. Data from these studies showed that the vaccines were immunogenic and well-tolerated among the study participants.”

Varicella-Zoster virus is a viral pathogen that induces chickenpox as a primary infection (usually in childhood) and herpes zoster (shingles) as a reactivated latent infection (meaning the virus lies dormant in the nervous system, waiting for an opportunity to re-emerge and cause active infection).

“Varicella (chickenpox) is an acute infectious disease. It is caused byvaricella-zoster virus (VZV), whichis a DNA virusthat is a member of the herpesvirus group.After the primary infection, VZV stays in the body(in the sensory nerve ganglia)as a latent infection. Primary infection with VZV causes varicella.Reactivation of latent infection causes herpes zoster (shingles).”

We now know now that the COVID injections have been tied through documented mechanisms to the degradation of the human immune system, leaving the organism susceptible to opportunistic latent viruses like VZV.

ViaFood and Chemical Toxicology:

“There has been an unwavering message about the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 from the public health apparatus in the US and around the globe. The efficacy is increasingly in doubt, as shown in a recent letter to the Lancet Regional Health by Günter Kampf. Kampf provided data showing that the vaccinated are now as likely as the unvaccinated to spread disease. He concluded: “It appears to be grossly negligent to ignore the vaccinated population as a possible and relevant source of transmission when deciding about public health control measures.” Moreover,the inadequacy of phase I, II, and III trials to evaluate mid-term and long-term side effects from mRNA genetic vaccines may have been misleading on their suppressive impact on the innate immunity of the vaccinees.

In this paper, we call attention tothree very important aspects of the safety profile of these vaccinations.First is the extensively documented subversion of innate immunity, primarily via suppression of IFN-α and its associated signaling cascade.This suppression will have a wide range of consequences, not the least of which include the reactivation of latent viral infections*and the reduced ability to effectively combat future infections. Second is the dysregulation of the system for both preventing and detecting genetically driven malignant transformation within cells and the consequent potential for vaccination to promote those transformations. Third, mRNA vaccination potentially disrupts intracellular communication carried out by exosomes, and induces cells taking up spike glycoprotein mRNA to produce high levels of spike-glycoprotein-carrying exosomes, with potentially serious inflammatory consequences.Should any of these potentials be fully realized, the impact on billions of people around the world could be enormous and could contribute to both the short-term and long-term disease burdenour health care system faces.”

This is not theoretical, either. Real-world studies have documented a temporal (probably causal) relationship between COVID-19 shots and herpes infections.

ViaJournal of Cosmetic Dermatology:

“[The objective is]to describe the demographic, clinical, morphological characteristics, outcomes, and timing of development of herpes zoster to the various COVID-19 vaccines. And to identify on whether COVID-19 vaccine has temporal relationship between development of herpes zoster (HZ)…

A total of 54 cases consisting of 27 male and 27 female patients have been reported. There were cases with known risk factors for herpes zoster, which included age more than 50 years (n = 36), immunological disorders (n = 10), chronic disease (n = 25), metabolic disorder (n = 13), malignancy (n = 4), and psychiatric disorder (n = 2). The mean (SD) period between development of herpes zoster and COVID-19 vaccination was 7.64 (6.92) days. Majority of the cases were from the high-income and/or middle-income countries.86.27% of the cases of HZ were reported due to mRNA vaccine. Thirty-six patients 36/45 (80%) developed herpes zoster following the priming dose of COVID-19 vaccine among those who received mRNA vaccine.”

What this boils down to is the sickening and ultimate killing of the useless eaters — harvesting as much profit out of them in the process as possible via endless pharmaceutical products, many of which force-fed to the public at the end of a government barrel.

The evil cannot be done justice with written words, a feat I struggle to accomplish.

2024-04-05 16:11:13,Making the Most of the Total Solar Eclipse 8th April,https://web.archive.org/web/20240407121010/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-06/making-most-total-solar-eclipse-8th-april,"One of the little known facts about the coming total solar eclipse is that its path crosses the previous October 2023 partial eclipse over Texas, the state that has recently seen bitter political divisions concerning the border with Mexico.

Not if you are the Vedic astrologer Silvia Suryodaya.

From herYouTube channelSilvia has produced a number of videos about what she calls theonce in a centuryevents taking place in the sky this month.

According to Silvia the path of the two eclipse crossing over Texas is likely to signal more division and separation in the state and in the United States as a whole (21:48) in this election year.

It may be that Texas becomes the focal point of what she callsa great ending and a new beginning(15.16).

From an astrological point of view this ending and beginning comes from the total eclipse taking place in the sign of Pieces, the last house of the zodiac (1:45).  This is followed on the 20thof April by an exact conjunction between the planets Uranus and Jupiter in Aries (18:13).  Aries is the first house of the zodiac.  It is this combination of total eclipse in the last house and the Uranus/Jupiter conjunction in the first house that gives this month its extraordinary astrological significance.

In astrological terms Uranus is the planet of revolution.  William Herschel discovered it in 1781 at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution that has transformed human society.  It was also the time of the French Revolution of 1789 with its cry ofliberté, égalité, fraternitéand accompanying reign of terror perpetuated by Jean-Paul Marat amongst others.

When this revolutionary energy is combined with the expansiveness of Jupiter it can mean two things.

It can mean the energy of Uranus is intensified and its revolutionary nature accentuated.

But Jupiter is also associated with good fortune so its combination with Uranus can mean the changes brought by Uranus can also be beneficial – in other words, theliberté, égalité, fraternitéwithout the reign of terror.

The crux of Silvia’s message is that these April events in the sky areindicatorsof the energies now influencing the earth.  How these energies are expressed is up to us:

You can determine how things can change. Nothing is set in stone(20:50).

The twist is that we need a degree of self-awareness if we are to influence how they manifest.  As Carl Gustav Jung famously put itwhat we do not come to consciously we experience as fate.

Silvia believes many men and women will awaken to their true identity due to the Uranus/Jupiter conjunction (19:40).  However she warns that initially the road may be rocky.  It can be tough to realise we have been living in an illusion of false beliefs about ourselves, illusions that go to the very foundation of society’s present structures (20:00).

The first phase of theTroubles Awayprotocol is about clearing the foundational beliefs of the illusion men and women have lived with for thousands of years.

As Jung makes clear, those who resist this process of inner change are likely to experience the full impact of the new energies as external events.  Expect more earthquakes.

However the more men and women that are self-aware and can process the energies as personal transformation, the more beneficial their impact will be. After all, as Silvia says, the whole point of these times of change is to enable us to live freer, more self-determined lives.

So from an astrological perspective this month is a big deal.

The total solar eclipse in the last house of the zodiac followed by the revolutionary Uranus/Jupiter conjunction on the 20thin the first house of the zodiac suggests the end of one way of life and the beginning of a new.  How we use these energies depends on our own state of being.

If these two remarkable events were not enough the month also includes the return of the periodic comet 12P/Pons-Brooks.  Variously nicknamed the Horned, Mother of Dragons or Millennium Falcon comet because of its split tail, the comet is one of the brightest in the sky.

Comets are seen as omens of change throughout history. Pliny reported a comet during the Battle of Salamis (480 BCE) that ended the Persian assault on Greece.  A comet woven into the Bayeux Tapestry portends the Norman conquest of England in 1066.  Giotto adds a comet into his 1304 depiction of the birth of Jesus.  In the New World the Aztec emperor Moctezuma sees a comet prior to the conquest of Mexico by Cortes.

Thanks to astrologers like Silvia we now know more about what changes we can expect from a comet this time around.

What we make of it is up to us.

Comet 12p/Pons-Brooks will be closest to the sun on 21stApril.

President Joe Biden’s new EV mandates will likely prove to be a sizable wealth transfer from rural red regions of America to urban blue sections, and to wealthy Democrats who reside in them, according to reports.

On March 20, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized its tailpipeemissions rulesfor the auto industry starting in 2027.

These rules are the strictest in history and will effectively force carmakers to have one-third of new car sales be plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) by 2027 and more than two-thirds by 2032.

This represents a dramatic increase from current EV sales, which were about 8 percent of the new car market in 2023.

Climate activists cheered the EPA’s move, with the Environmental Defense Fundcallingit “a day to celebrate American achievement.”

But critics say that the measures will be particularly punitive for huge segments of the U.S. population who don’t want, can’t use, or can’t afford EVs. If carmakers go along with President Biden’s plan to shift their fleets to EVs, the cost of remaining gas-fired cars and trucks will likely escalate as demand dwarfs supply.

“This isn’t industrial policy,” Robert Bryce, author and energy analyst, told The Epoch Times. “In reality it’s a type of class warfare that will prevent low- and middle-income consumers from being able to afford new cars.”

And as many traditional car buyers struggle, the federal subsidies and incentives continue to flow, to the benefit of EV buyers.

According to anOctober 2023 reportby the Texas Public Policy Foundation, as much as $48,000 of the cost of the average EV sold in the United States is paid, not by the owner, but in the form of “socialized costs” that are spread out among taxpayers and electricity consumers over a 10-year period.

These socialized costs come in the form of taxes, government subsidies, fuel economy credits paid by gas carmakers to EV manufacturers, and higher electricity bills as consumers absorb the capital costs required to expand the power grid and install new charging stations.

The report states that“the average model year 2021 EV would cost $48,698 more to own over a 10-year period without $22 billion in government favors given to EV manufacturers and owners.”

These dollars, which do not take into account the additional dollars that gas-car owners will likely pay for their vehicles as manufacturers are forced to make fewer of them, amount to a government-mandated wealth transfer to affluent EV owners, paid by those who often cannot afford to buy EVs.

The new EPA mandate is “aimed at accommodating a very narrow segment of the auto-buying public: wealthy, white Democrats who live in a handful of liberal communities,” Mr. Bryce said. “EV ownership is largely defined by class, ideology, and geography.”

In a Februaryanalysisof EV buyers, Mr. Bryce reported that 57 percent of them earn more than $100,000 annually, 75 percent are male, and 87 percent are white. In addition, EV buyers are overwhelmingly Democrats, with 71 percent of Republicans stating in a Galluppollthat they would not consider owning an electric vehicle.

A 2023 University of California Energy Institutereportfound“a strong and enduring correlation between political ideology and U.S. EV adoption.”

Looking at county-level data on new vehicle registrations between 2012 and 2022, the report stated that 50 percent of all new EVs were sold into the top 10 percent of most-Democrat counties, with 70 percent going to the top 25 percent most-Democrat counties, and 90 percent going to the top 50 percent most-Democrat counties.

Twenty counties bought 40 percent of all EVs sold in this period, the report states, and “most of these counties are urban, high-income, and in Democratic states.”

Data from the Department of Energy supports this view. As of year-end 2022, California had 903,600registeredEVs in the state, or 37 percent of all EVs owned nationwide.

The next largest number of EV owners were in Florida, Texas, and Washington state, with 168,000, 149,000, and 104,100 EVs respectively, followed by New Jersey, New York, Georgia, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.

The states on this list are home to large cities and suburbs, which are the target market for EVs. This contrasts sharply with rural states like Wyoming and North Dakota, where 800 and 600 EV owners reside, respectively.

According to areportby the Committee to Unleash Prosperity,“if you count all the EVs in North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Mississippi, West Virginia, Alabama, Montana, and Idaho, they account for less than one percent of the total U.S. sales.”

Of the top 10 states in terms of EV per capita ownership, seven are “deep blue states,” the report notes.

“By contrast, the 10 states with the smallest market penetration for EVs were all red states,” Unleash Prosperity states.

“Ironically, Joe Biden is the worst thing that ever happened to this industry. EVs have become ‘Biden cars.’”

The Biden administration is not alone in attempting to force Americans to switch to electric cars. A number of blue states including California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington are on track to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars and trucks by 2035,accordingto non profit group Coltura, which advocates for the switch from gasoline to electric cars.

The lack of interest in EVs among red states isn’t merely a political issue, however. There are practical reasons why people are unwilling to spend thousands of dollars more on electric cars. According to a November 2023 AAAsurvey, the primary reasons for people not to buy electric cars are a lack of charging stations, limited range, and time to charge the battery.

A recent Rasmussenpollfound that 65 percent of Americans surveyed don’t think they’re likely to make an EV their next automobile purchase.

""This is mind-blowingly bad,"" said one Garda employee,KTLA5reports. ""You would never suspect it, $30 million in the Valley — gone.""

The March 31st heist is among the largest in LA history.

According to theLA Times, the thievesentered the building through the roof, tripping no alarms - andthere was no obvious sign of break-inon the vault itelf. Officials weren't even aware of the heist until the safe was opened Monday.

The thieves also cut a hole in the side off the building, which was later covered with plywood and has now been repaired,KTLA5reports.

Both the LAPD and FBI have yet to comment on how the crew got away unnoticed.

One law enforcement official with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s Major Crimes Bureau who is not on this case told KTLA thatmoney storage facilities like GardaWorld in Sylmar have multiple layers of security and other fortified systems, including alarms and motion sensors. -KTLA

So duh, clearly an inside job.

According to retired FBI Special-Agent-in-Charge of the LA field office Robert Clark,investigators ""will try to determine who had access to the facility, who was aware of the schedule and knew that the money would be in the facility and [for] how long, the security around the facility and how much time they would be able to have to gain access and be able to move such a large amount of money.""

Clark thinks there's a good chance the crew well get caught.

""I think the likelihood is very high because you don’t move that kind of money very quickly,"" he said. ""It’s not like you’re grabbing a couple of checks and running out the door. To be able to liquidate [it] would be very difficult.You’ll have to have a team of individuals that do it.""

2024-04-05 19:40:00,"Japan To Embark On An Era Of ""Mass Foreign Immigration""",https://web.archive.org/web/20240406124235/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/japan-embark-era-mass-foreign-immigration,"Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Modernity.news,

Japan appears to be transitioning from a homogenous society to embrace ‘diversity and inclusivity’ by ushering in “an era of mass foreign immigration.”

It’s set to be a massive change for a country that was still up until recently 97.5% ethnic Japanese, according to theCIA World Factbook.

A Bloomberg reportdetailshowrapidly declining native birth rates, an aging society and a chronic labor shortage is fueling the importation of millions of foreigners who “are changing the face of Japan.”

The number of foreign workers in Japan has now exceeded 2 million, a 12.4% increase on 2022. The East Asian country needs at least 647,000 working-age immigrants per year to meet its 11 million worker shortage by 2040.

“Japan is entering an era of mass foreign immigration,”said Junji Ikeda, president of Saikaikyo, a Hiroshima-based agency that sources and supervises foreign workers.“Incremental adjustments will not suffice,”he added.

Underone programalone, 820,000 migrants will be admitted to work in the transportation and logistics sectors, a doubling of the previously agreed number, in order “to make efforts to realize an inclusive society,” according to Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi.

While the process is being implemented under ‘skilled worker visas’,the actual roles migrants will fill include taxi drivers, bus drivers and factory workers.

Japan to admit 820,000 foreigners in transportation, logistics sectors; eases current regulations -https://t.co/Lj5j8IwKQjpic.twitter.com/1sWFCswLu5

The service industry will also be increasingly filled with foreign migrants, who will subsequently be allowed to bring their families to stay in Japan indefinitely.

The Economistreportsthat a “glimpse at Japan’s future” looks like convenience stores being staffed overwhelmingly by migrants, highlighting “the importance of immigration.”

The news outlet cites one such 7-Eleven store in central Tokyo where “all the staff are Burmese.”

For a glimpse at Japan’s future, look at its convenience storeshttps://t.co/FGAlQ2Qsnq

“Gearoid Reidy in an article for the Japan Times estimates that the number of overseas workers has more than doubled in the last decade, while the broader foreign community, which includes children and students, has risen by 50 per cent,” reportsthe Spectator.

“Reidy envisages a time when more than 10 per cent of Japan’s population will be foreign born, putting the famously homogenous, exclusive, nation on a par with the UK, U.S and France.”

Is Japan finally embracing immigration?https://t.co/pwvnqobPB3

At the end of last year, the governmentannouncedthat crime had risen for the first time in 20 years,a situation native Japanese people might become more familiar with in the coming years.

A BBC Newsreportabout Japan’s previous refusal to adopt mass migration highlighted how the country was “stuck in the past,” with that past being characterized as “a peaceful, prosperous country with the longest life expectancy in the world, the lowest murder rate, little political conflict.”

Japan was the future but it's stuck in the pasthttps://t.co/xwsnvGjWki

Apparently, affordable property prices, “refusing immigration and maintaining the patriarchy,” and the fact that “Japan still feels like Japan, and not a reproduction of America,” is being “stuck in the past.”

However, while importing large numbers of workers, Japan does still seem to be keen to limit foreign nationals claiming to be asylum seekers.

A new systemstartingin June will give the government the power to deport foreigners who have had their asylum claims rejected multiple times.

2024-04-05 20:20:00,Judge Dismisses DeSantis From Lawsuit Over Illegal Immigrant Flights To Martha’s Vineyard,https://web.archive.org/web/20240406124235/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/judge-dismisses-desantis-lawsuit-over-illegal-immigrant-flights-marthas-vineyard#comment-stream,"Authored by Aldgra Fredly via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

A federal judge on Monday dismissed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis from a lawsuit filed by illegal immigrants who were transported to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, on chartered flights in 2022.

In a 77-pageruling, U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs said that there were “insufficient facts” presented in the lawsuit to exercise jurisdiction over Mr. DeSantis and other staff members.

“On the present record, the court cannot ascertain what actions were undertaken by whom and therefore cannot determine which, if any, of the individual defendants transacted business or caused injury here,leaving it no choice but to find that, at least on this record, personal jurisdiction has not been established,” the judge stated.

However, Judge Burroughs stated that the illegal immigrants could still proceed with their suit against Vertol, the Florida-based company that was paid $1.5 million to transport illegal immigrants to the island.

The court found thatthe facts of the case “taken together, support an inference that Vertol and the other Defendants specifically targeted Plaintiffs because they were Latinx immigrants.”

Judge Burroughs also said that Vertol and the other defendants “were not legitimately enforcing any immigration laws” when transporting the illegal immigrants.

“Instead, as alleged, they exploited [Plaintiffs] in a scheme to boost the national profile of Defendant DeSantis and manipulate them for political ends. Moreover, Plaintiffs’ images were captured and sent to national news media,” the judge said.

“Unlike ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents legitimately enforcing the country’s immigration laws ...the Court sees no legitimate purpose for rounding up highly vulnerable individuals on false pretenses and publicly injecting them into a divisive national debate,” she added.

The judge stated that “treating vulnerable individuals like Plaintiffs in this way, as alleged and accepted as true for purposes of the motion to dismiss ... is nothing short of extreme, outrageous, uncivilized, intolerable, and stunning.”

Lawyers for Civil Rights (LCR) in Boston filed a federal civil rights class action lawsuit in 2022 against Mr. DeSantis, Secretary of Florida Department of Transportation Secretary Jared Perdue, the State of Florida, and their “accomplices, challenging the fraudulent and discriminatory scheme to transport nearly 50 vulnerable immigrants, including women and children, from San Antonio, Texas to Martha’s Vineyard without shelter or resources in place.”

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a class of affected illegal immigrants, including those stranded in Martha’s Vineyard, andAlianza Americas, a network of organizations supporting illegal immigrants across the United States, according to a statement.

The illegal immigrants, many of whom were Venezuelans, were allegedly told if they were willing to board planes to other states, they would receive social services.

LCR has hailed the ruling as “a major victory” for the affected illegal immigrants.

It said that the ruling “sends a crucial message: private companies can—and will—be held accountable for helping rogue state actors violate the rights of vulnerable immigrants through illegal and fraudulent schemes.”

“All other defendants have been dismissed, but only for now. The dismissal is ‘without prejudice,’ meaning that the claims may be reasserted and reinstated,” the organization said in a statement.

“To be clear: the Martha’s Vineyard migrants will not stop here,” it added.

LCR said that they would continue to pursue their claims in federal court against all defendants, “including by seeking jurisdictional discovery to prove the viability of the claims against the dismissed parties.”

2024-04-05 20:40:00,Lab-Grown Meat Isn't For Everyone,https://web.archive.org/web/20240406124235/https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/lab-grown-meat-isnt-everyone#comment-stream,"Would you eat laboratory-grown meat?

This question,as Statista's Anna Fleck reportswas posed recently to respondents of their Consumer Insightssurvey, seems to divide opinions.

Laboratory-grown meat, also known ascultivated or cultured meat, is produced from animal cells, often taken by biopsy. These are then placed in a “nutrient bath” in order to develop meat outside the animal. In theory, cultured meat could offer an option to those concerned about animal welfare, or the meat industry's impact on our planet, as its production requires neither the breeding nor the slaughter of living animals.

However, as Fleck shows in the infographic below,the idea of eating laboratory-grown meat is still not that convincing to a majority of people.

You will find more infographics atStatista

While one in five people surveyed in India said they would be willing to try this new type of food, only 9 percent of respondents in France said the same.

In the United States, which is one of only two countries where this meat is currently marketed (alongside Singapore), 16 percent of respondents said they were open to the idea of eating it.

It is unlikely though that cellular meat will soon find its way onto European plates, as no authorization application has yet been filed for the bloc’s market.

2024-04-05 21:00:00,Nebraska State Senator Switching From Democrat To Republican Over Abortion,https://web.archive.org/web/20240406124235/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/nebraska-state-senator-switching-democrat-republican-over-abortion#comment-stream,"Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Nebraska state Sen. Mike McDonnell has announced that he’s switching party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his Christian faith and views on abortion.

Mr. McDonnell made the announcement in an April 3 statement to local media outlets, citing the Democratic Party’s opposition to his pro-life stance.

“When I ran for reelection in 2020, I was pro-life,” he said, adding that he’s Catholic and recalling that in 2016, he ran as a pro-life candidate for Nebraska’s fifth legislative district.

“Ihave asked the Democratic Party to respect my religious-based pro-life position. Instead, over the last year, they have decided to punish me for being pro-life.”

Mr. McDonnell said that, because he opposes abortion, Douglas County Democrats voted not to seat him as a delegate and not share party resources, while the state Democratic Party voted to censure him for his pro-life views.

“Being a Christian member of the Roman Catholic Church and pro-life is more important to me than being a registered Democrat,” he said, adding that he was switching to the GOP effective immediately.

The Nebraska Democratic Party issued a statement in response to Mr. McDonnell’s party change, expressing “respect” for his work with the party while denying that the censure vote had anything to do with his pro-life views.

“The Nebraska Democratic Party will continue to stand up for reproductive freedom and the human rights of the LGBTQ community,” Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb said in the statement.

“Our decision to censure Sen. McDonnell was never about him being a pro-life Catholic. Our decision was based on our party reaffirming our core values to protect women’s ability to make health decisions and to keep politicians out of our personal health decisions.”

Ms. Kleeb said that she and her Nebraska Democrat colleagues “respect the ongoing work of Senator McDonnell on behalf of unions and his commitment to protect a fair electoral vote system” in the state.

Mr. McDonnell’s party affiliation switch could signal that Nebraska may be headed for a major change as Republican leaders have expressed support for a move to a winner-take-all system for allocating the state’s Electoral College votes.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican,showed a willingnesson April 2 to back legislation that would potentially prevent President Joe Biden from getting one of the state’s electoral votes. He did this by endorsing a statewide “winner-takes-all” system that is likely to boost former President Donald Trump.

Unlike every other U.S. state, only Nebraska and Maine assign Electoral College votes by district. A congressional district that centers around Omaha, the largest city in the state, has sometimes gone in favor of Democratic presidential candidates, including in 2020.

However, if the state switched to a more standard system, Nebraska’s three electoral votes would likely all go to President Trump as the former president easily won the GOP-dominated state by wide margins in both 2016 and 2020.

In January, legislatorsintroduced a billto use the standard, winner-take-all system. In a social media post on April 2, Mr. Pillen endorsed the initiative.

“It would bring Nebraska into line with 48 of our fellow states, better reflect the founders’ intent, and ensure our state speaks with one unified voice in presidential elections,” Mr. Pillenwroteon X, formerly known as Twitter. “I call upon fellow Republicans in the Legislature to pass this bill to my desk so I can sign it into law.”

His comment was backed by President Trump on social media, describing the governor’s endorsement of the measure as “very smart.”

“Governor Jim Pillen of Nebraska, a very smart and popular Governor, who has done some really great things, came out today with a very strong letter in support of returning Nebraska’s Electoral Votes to a Winner-Take-All System,” President Trump wrote on Tuesday.

“Most Nebraskans have wanted to go back to this system for a very long time, because it’s what 48 other States do—It’s what the Founders intended, and it’s right for Nebraska,” he continued. “Thank you Governor for your bold leadership. Let’s hope the Senate does the right thing. Nebraskans, respectfully ask your Senators to support this Great Bill!”

In 2020, President Joe Biden won Nebraska’s Omaha-based congressional district, giving him one electoral vote.  President Trump carried the state with nearly 60 percent of the vote.

Some analysts have said on social media that if the Nebraska bill is signed into law, it would pose a problem for President Biden because he wouldn’t have a clear path to 270 votes to win the presidency.

2024-04-05 21:20:00,These Are The Countries With The Highest Corporate Tax Rates,https://web.archive.org/web/20240406124235/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/these-are-countries-highest-corporate-tax-rates,"In 1980, the global average corporate tax rate stood at40.2%- a levelnotably higher than today...

Over the last several decades, corporate tax rates have declined across every region, with the average now falling at 23.5% as of 2023. As tax rates have sunk lower, U.S. Treasury Secretary JanetYellen and others have called for a global minimum corporate tax to prevent multinationals from sheltering profits in tax havens.

But on the other hand, some argue that lower corporate rates allow corporations to report more income and boost real business activities.

The graphic below, fromPranav Gavali,via Visual Capitalist,shows the countries with the highest corporate tax rates since 1980.

Below, we show how countries with the highest corporate taxes have changed over the last four decades, based on data from theTax Foundation:

As the above table shows, countries clustered in Africa and South America have the top rates globally.

Argentina, with a corporate tax rate of35%, hiked up rates from 25% in 2022 as the country was mired in a deepening economic crisis. The country has also been a key supporter of a global minimum tax, suggesting it should be raised as high as 25%.

Malta, the only European nation on the list, also has one of the highest rates. Yet itstax systemis complex: local businesses pay a 35% rate on profits, but international firms can pay as low as 5% in Malta with an additional 10% tax paid in their originating country.

By contrast, we can see that in 1980, countries including India, China and the United Kingdom had corporate tax ratesabove 50%. Since then, China underwent a series of economic reforms that included key tax reductions that helped drive the growth of its private sector.

In the United Kingdom, tax rates were 52% four decades ago and now fall at 25%. The U.S. tells a similar story, with corporate rates standing at 46% in 1980—more than double the rates seen today. Major corporate tax cuts were seen during Reagan’s presidency during the 1980s, when rates were cut to 35%, and later in 2017 when they were further reduced to 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

2024-04-05 21:40:00,Liberals Trying To Force Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor To Retire,https://web.archive.org/web/20240406124235/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/liberals-trying-force-supreme-court-justice-sonia-sotomayor-retire#comment-stream,"Authored by Matthew Vadum via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Liberals are mounting a pressure campaign to force liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor to retire from the benchso President Joe Biden, who faces a tough reelection fight in November, can appoint a younger liberal successor before the election.

Democrats fear that the 6–3 conservative majority on the nation’s highest court could become a 7–2 conservative majority if President Donald Trump wins the election in November and she dies during his second term of office.

They point out that PresidentTrump was able to replace liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died of pancreatic cancer complications on Sept. 18, 2020, at 87, with conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett days before the 2020 election.

Justice Ginsburg refused to step down despite her fragile health.

Justice Barrett’s appointment, they say, helped supply the votes on the Court needed to overturn abortion rights precedent Roe v. Wade by a 5–4 vote in June 2022.

The ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization found there was no right to abortion in the U.S. Constitution and returned the regulation of abortion to the states, which Roe had taken away.

Justice Sotomayor, 69, is reportedly in good health, but activists have seized on the fact that she has had Type I diabetes since she was 7 years oldand that she has had some health scares.

They note that she is the only Supreme Court justice to have traveled with a medic and remarked she was “tired” during a talk in January at UC Berkeley Law School.

In January 2018, she was reportedly treated at her home for low blood sugar by paramedics but was able to report for work afterward.

Left-wing activists seem emboldened becausethey successfully pressured liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, now 85, to retire in June 2022,which allowed President Biden to replace him with liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, now 53.

In an April 3 broadcast on NBC News, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), said Justice Sotomayor should consider stepping down soon.

“Justices have to make their personal decisions about their health, and their level of energy, but also to keep in mind the larger national and public interest in making sure that the Court looks and thinks like America,” the senator said.

“We should learn a lesson, you know? And it’s not like there’s any mystery here about what the lesson should be—that the old saying, ‘graveyards are full of indispensable people,’ ourselves in this body included.”

Before that, left-wing commentator Mehdi Hasan published a column in The Guardian (UK) saying it pained him to argue that JusticeSotomayor should make way for a younger successorwho can serve for decades on the Court because she is a good standard bearer for the progressive cause.

He described Justice Sotomayor as “the greatest liberal to sit on the Supreme Court in my adult lifetime.”

Mr. Hasan added that she is “the first Latina to hold the position of justice, [and] she has blazed a relentlessly progressive trail on the highest bench in the land.”

“Whether it was herlone dissentin a North Carolina voting rights case in 2016 (“the Court’s conclusion … is a fiction”); heringenious referencingof Ta-Nehisi Coates, James Baldwin, and WEB DuBois in another 2016 dissent over unreasonable searches and seizures.

“Herwithering observationat the Dobbs oral argument in 2021: (Will this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?’), Sotomayor has stood head and shoulders above both her liberal and conservative colleagues on the bench for the past 15 years.”

Although Justice Ginsburg had already survived two cancer diagnoses, she refused to retire even though liberal voices urged her to do so, Mr. Hasan wrote.

On her deathbed in 2020, she said her “most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,” yet President Trump “nominated Amy Coney Barrett as RBG’s replacement just eight days after her death, and Senate Republicans confirmed Barrett to RBG’s vacant seat just eight days before election day.”

With President Biden now trailing President Trump in polls in several swing states and Democrats “in danger of losing their razor-thin majority in the Senate, are we really prepared for history to repeat itself?”

Justice Sotomayor could “easily” survive a second Trump term and continue serving until 2029, “but why take that risk?Why not retire now?” he wrote.

Molly Coleman, executive director of the People’s Parity Project, also wants Justice Sotomayor to resign.

“This isn’t personal. This isn’t about one individual justice. It’s nothing to do with what an incredible legal talent Justice Sotomayor is. It’s about what’s in the best interests of the country moving forward,” she told NBC News.

The Biden administration is neutral on the issue so far.

White House spokesman Andrew Bates said: “President Biden believes that decisions to retire from the Supreme Court should be made by the justices themselves and no one else.”

The Epoch Times reached out to Justice Sotomayor for comment but had not received a reply as of press time.

The report argues that this leaves these countries “exposed to undue influence.”

The following chart,from Statista's Anna Fleck,showswhich countries have enforced regulations on the complete ban of financial contributions from anonymous donations, publicly owned enterprises and foreign states and foreign enterprises.

You will find more infographics atStatista

According to the report,the problem with foreign donations is that they can “unduly influence candidates and political parties and lead to overrepresentation of foreign actors’ interests in public institutions rather than the domestic public interest.”

For this reason, theOECDrecommends the transparency and traceability of funds.

Meanwhile, donations from publicly owned enterprises or state-owned enterprises can “blur the line between public and private and distort governance framework agreements between state-owned enterprises and the state”, including the “improper diversion of public funds” and risk of the idea that donations are given in exchange for “political allegiance”. Anonymous donations run the risk of the aforementioned donors circumnavigating rules.

As the chart above shows,bans on contributions to political parties from foreign states or enterprises are common for most OECD countries.

OnlyGreece, Australia, Denmark and Sweden do not have this rule. Meanwhile, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Australia, Denmark and Sweden stand out for not having a ban on funding from publicly owned enterprises.

Mike Gallagher– former Marine intelligence officer, fresh face of 2016, young idealist with enough honors to fill a trophy case –is quitting his congressional seat April 19.

The high school valedictorian, Princeton undergrad, and Georgetown PhD was elected to the House of Representatives before his thirty-third birthday. His intellect and eloquence made him a leader in the Republican caucus, someone capable of wielding not just votes but ideas to influence policy.

Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy acknowledged Gallagher’s status among his colleagues in January 2023 whenMcCarthy picked him to chair the newly formed House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. Gallagher was a fervent advocate for strengthening our China policy, and his ideas and passion drove the agenda of the 24-member committee.

Back home in Wisconsin’s eighth congressional district, voters resoundingly endorsed Gallagher. He garnered 63 percent of the vote in 2016, 64 percent in 2018 and 2020, and a whopping 72 percent in 2022.

We’ll never know how far he might have gone; how bright his star might have shone.

It’s unclear why Gallagher, a generational talent, is abandoning his seat halfway through his term.To spend more time with his family? Or, perhaps more cynically,to work for defense tech giantPalantir?Gallagher hasn’t said, but whatever his answer, he’s lowered the bar – as a veteran and a congressman.

Gallagherpromisedto work for Green Bay, Oshkosh, and the country, and the voters believed him. While the media fixates on whether Gallagher “betrayed the party,”the truth is he betrayed the American people. Gallagher happily displayed his service medals on campaign commercials, and proudly wore his USMC polo shirt while meeting the voters. I once attended a meeting where Gallagher sipped hot tea from a green canteen cup – odd but touching, like watching a young lieutenant showing the troops he’s all in.

Ultimately, though, Gallagher was like many others on the political stage; moreactorthan genuine article. Just another young, ambitious person playing the role of veteran, for as long as it served his self-interest.

I wish him well, but wonder if the decision, for him, won't age well.

Beneath the T-shirts and slogans, the medals and canteen cups, are the principles Gallagher learned in Quantico, and followed while serving in Iraq. The warrior ethos is ingrained in everyone who wears the uniform.Put the mission first. Never quit. And most importantly, never leave a Marine behind.

You fooled us, Mike, but did you fool yourself?

Citizen Soldierbelieves in life, liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

Several of the nation's power grids face increasing power brownout/blackout risks during high-demand periods. This overview we provided premium subscribers was published in a Wednesday note titled""The Next AI Trade.""

Cloud-computing startup CoreWeave's co-founder and chief strategy officer, Brian Venturo expands more on this. He spoke on Thursday at theBloomberg Intelligence Summiton generative AI in New York.

He said theworld is ""grossly"" underestimating how much AI demand will expand the need for data centersacross North America and the world.

Venturo said the cloud computing provider hasseen an ""absurd"" amount of data center requests over the last several quarters.He noted that some companies are asking to reserve entire campuses for themselves.

""There are going to be some things that this industry is going to have to work through,"" Venturo said, adding,""What worries me"" is that there's not enough infrastructure to handle the demand.

He stressed, ""It's a sprint. It's a sprint that requires all the capital in the world"" to build new data centers and revamp old ones and upgrade the existing infrastructure to supply the electricity needs of data centers. This urgency highlights the need for swift action by smart grid companies and utilities that can rapidly build out the grid for the digital age.

""You have to build new transmission lines,""Venturo said, adding,""You have to do new substation builds. There are just a lot of physical blockers here that are hard to overcome in the short-term.""

Reverting to our""The Next AI Trade"" note, we emphasized to premium subs the potential for significant investment opportunities with companies that have high exposure to infrastructure, electrification, power grid, and energy.

The companies, such as the ones in Goldman's ""Power Up America"" basket (Bloomberg ticker GSENEPOW), will be some of the winners over the coming years.

2024-04-05 23:00:00,Extremism On The Ballot,https://web.archive.org/web/20240406124235/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/extremism-ballot,"Authored by Peachy Keenan via AmericanMind.org,

The 2024 election is between a dangerous madman and Donald Trump...

I hope everyone enjoyed a wonderful day with family and friends on the holiest day of America’s liturgical year, the Transgender Day of Visibility. I had never heard of this blessed Federal holiday until a few days ago, but my kids loved it. We had a visit from the Easter Drag Bunny and it/they filled the kids’ baskets with all kinds of treats. Puberty blockers, dilators, lipstick for the boys, packers for the girls. She/They is risen—and you will bow down and worship Her/Them!

Of course, Joe Biden’s Easter sacrilege was only the latest travesty that proves what you and I already know, which is that the 2024 presidential election is a contest between common-sense centrism and dangerously radical extremism.

One candidate is a classical liberal whose positions are squarely in the middle of the political spectrum.On nearly every issue, his views are anodyne, conventional, mainstream—positions that were the norm, nationwide, in every state, on both sides of the aisle, within recent memory (not including a few fringe strongholds in Berkeley and the West Village).

His opponent, however, is a dangerous radical extremist; a divisive, fanatical agent of chaos who holds frightening positions that threaten to destroy America.

To preserve what’s left of Our Sacred Democracy, the extremist must be stopped.

The radicals we are up against are so deranged that they are embracing and even leaning into the Replacement Theory they once vilified and dismissed as fake. You will recall that “replacement theory” was a taboo conspiracy only racists and bigots believed in until about 15 minutes ago. But the extremists running the country recently decided thatakshally, “replacement” is the perfect strategy to finish off what’s left of what you and the country formerly known as “America.”

Replacement means you don’t need to worry about convincing Congress to pass new laws or give speeches or waste time governing. To get your way, just replace everyone.

But the extremists in charge are not going to stop after replacing you with “newcomers.” They’re replacing everything not nailed down.

Easter just got replaced with a demonic child abuse cult festival.

Jews are getting erased, literally chased out of cities, harassed out of college, and replaced with ululating Hamas enthusiasts.

Your grandchildren got replaced with fur babies.

Formerly great universities have been replaced with plagiarizing paperclip factories.

Your borders have been replaced with Welcome Centers.

Your retirement has been replaced with twenty more years of work to pay for safe injection sites for your kids and free gender affirmation surgeries for the world.

As Elon Musk likes to point out on X, Americans are just four percent of the Earth’s population. Soon, they’ll be just four percent of their own country.

This is, in President Biden’s own words, going according to plan. “Just like we drew it up,”he tweetedominously.

An explosion in robberies and violent crime. Two dangerous new foreign wars. Forced conversion therapy on normal people to make them believe children can change their sex. Rampant hate crimes and open, gleeful discrimination against people who are not “of color.”

Who is the extremist again?

The dangerous tyrant seeking re-election has the full support of our bloodthirsty elites, a warmongering foreign policy establishment, virulently antisemitic academia, and the entire mainstream media apparatus.Sometimes it’s hard to even fathom what we are facing, but then you remember that they had the nerve to arrest and sentence a young man toprisonfor… wait for it… sharing a funny Hillary Clinton meme. That actually happened in real life.

The humble moderate whom these frightening cretins hope to defeat this fall faces expropriation of his property to satisfy hundreds of millions of dollars in absurd fines, plus hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees to fight regime lawfare on a Hiroshima scale. The threat of prison looms. His support comes not from wealthy celebrities, titans of industry, or the tech billionaires. It comes from the peasants. The rabble. A ragtag coalition of nobodies, the working class, the powerless middle class, and a few anonymous dissidents forced to post samizdat from undisclosed locations to avoid the eye of Sauron.

The radical extremist we face wants to empty our treasury so he can continue to launder hundreds of billions of our dollars through the most corrupt nation in Europe, which for decades was the world’s number one producer of child pornography, among other evils.

He’s flirting with nuclear war, and even committed an illegal act of war by detonating an enormous oil pipeline that helped heat all of Europe. His military bosses are blackmailing brave American military families: if they don’t cough up the cash for Ukraine, he’ll send their enlisted kids to die in a hole in Siberia. Thanks to him, 13 Marines were blown up in Afghanistan, but if you’re a grieving parent who protests, he has you handcuffed and dragged to prison, as he did to one dad who dared to protest at the State of the Union.

This extremist lunatic is also doing whatever he can to trigger another Middle East quagmire that inevitably will put boots on the ground in all the old stomping grounds. He wears Catholicism like a skinsuit, blaspheming the rosary around his wrist as he excoriates actual people of faith who want to protect the unborn. He screams for abortion through 40 weeks, for any reason.

He sends his shock troops to arrest pro-life protestors and slanders parents as “domestic extremists.”

He’s so extreme he thinks young children can choose to change their genders with irreversible experimental surgeries that have catastrophic rates of failure. He wants parents who don’t allow schools to secretly change a child’s gender behind their backs to lose control of their children and go to prison.

He’s so radical that he thinks it’s funny when you can’t afford groceries, and wonders why you don’t buy the “other Raisin Bran” in order to save a dollar. He mocks you when he declares “Let them eat more chips,” as he pledges to increase the number of Doritos in each shrinkflated bag.

Worst of all, this crazed extremist thinks it’s good to dissolve the nation’s borders, permanently and eternally. He wants to pack the country with the excess population of Central and South America, as well as Africa and Asia, to boost congressional reapportionment numbers and make America blue forever. Any kids that get raped or murdered are not his problem. The tree of extremism must be watered by the blood of America’s daughters like Laken Riley.

Our only hope, my fellow centrists, is to throw our entire weight behind the common-sense moderate running against Joe Biden. All he wants is to return the country to the way it was within recent memory (!):  a blessed land that enjoyed low illegal immigration, low crime, low prices, low inflation, low mortgage interest rates, and high patriotism and, imagine—optimism.

Our demands are simple. We want a leader who will make the country a place where normal citizens can go about their lives in peace, enjoy a bit of prosperity, not have to worry about politics constantly, and not get pushed in front of a train waiting for the subway on the way to work.

A poll says most of the electorate is “unhappy” with their choice of candidates and wishes it wasn’t a Trump-Biden rematch.

Get over it and get on board. You don’t have any other option.

The Regime’s iron grip on power can only be broken by finally calling them what they are: domestic extremists inflicting acts of terror, violence, and child abuse on innocent citizens.Their hegemony can only be broken by regular, reasonable people in the middle—in other words, you, me, and Donald Trump—exorcising them from power and driving them back into the fetid swamps from whence they came.

The current Regime represents an existential threat to our lives and liberty. They are no longer a political party; they are a violent hate group, and the group they hate is us.

Only God himself can show them mercy, and I doubt he will when the time comes.

Vote for the centrist if you want to live!

2024-04-05 23:40:00,World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here's Why It Can't Be Avoided,https://web.archive.org/web/20240406124235/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/world-war-iii-now-inevitable-heres-why-it-cant-be-avoided#comment-stream,"Authored by Brandon Smith via Alt-Market.us,

If you’re getting the feeling like the globalists are really pushing hard for WWIII these days, you’re not alone.

In the past few months there has been multiple instances of European and US officials hinting at the possibility of a new military draft, the EU has talked openly about boots on the ground in Ukraine, NATO officials have stated unequivocally that they WILL NOT accept a loss in Ukraine to the Russians and the Kremlin has warned once again that nuclear weapons are on the table if western troops enter the war. The US government has recently asserted that Ukraine will be joining NATO, a red line in the sand for Russia.

Then there’s Israel and Gaza. I warned months ago in my article‘It’s A Trap! The Wave Of Repercussions As The Middle East Fights “The Last War”’that the war in Gaza would expand into a multi-front conflict that would probably include Iran. I also warned that it would be to Israel’s benefit if Iran entered the war because this would force the US to become directly involved. To be sure, Iran has already been engaging in proxy attacks on Israel through Lebanon, but Israel’s attack on the Iranian “embassy” or diplomatic station in Syria basically ensures that Iran will now directly commit to strikes on Israeli targets.

In other words, much like WWI, the situation is being escalated by the political elites despite the fact that the general public in the west is increasingly opposed to participating in the conflict.The globalists want to send us to war whether we like it or not.  Every decision they have made so far makes peaceful resolution impossible.

One saving grace that is perhaps new in the entire history of geopolitics is that the public is far more awake and aware of the fact that it’s not necessarily their “duty” to blindly go fight when their government calls on them to do so. Social media has also given a platform for people to widely voice their concerns about war, whereas in the past objectors felt isolated.

Obviously, some of this is based purely on fear – A large percentage of Gen Z is unequipped mentally or physically to go to war, which is why more than 70% of potential military recruits today are rejected before they even get to boot camp. These are many of the same young people who post Ukrainian flags to their social media profiles and jump headfirst into anti-Russian rhetoric, but now that they are faced with the possibility of having to sacrifice themselves for Ukraine they are angry and terrified.

However, there is also a large contingent of capable (and mostly conservative) men with the background and the aptitude for combat that still want nothing to do with Ukraine. The reason is simple:They believe that far-left western governments and globalists want to use them as cannon fodder to get rid of them. Once they are used up in war, there will be no one left to oppose the leftist takeover at home.

For most of us in America, Ukraine is irrelevant and we grow tired of wars in the Middle East. Whether left or right, we have no interest in fighting for them. But that’s not going to matter much, at least in terms of preventing a global war.

War with Russia will depend more on European involvement than US involvement.While the US has been the largest provider of armaments to Ukraine by far, the ultimate goal I believe is to integrate European troops into the Ukrainian front, which would be an automatic declaration of global war.

The basis for mobilization of troops from Europe is “domino theory” propaganda.We’ve heard some of it here in America but nowhere near the same level as the EU populace. Governments assert that Russia’s goal is to clear Ukraine as a pathway to invade the rest of Europe. This is the same claim used as justification for the US war in Vietnam: “If we let one country fall to the enemy, all the surrounding countries will fall also.”

Both Ukrainian and NATO leadership suggests that war must continue in Ukraine in order to contain it. There has been no serious discussion of diplomacy, which is utterly bizarre considering the stakes involved. A peace proposal should have been broached the moment the war kicked off and there should have been ongoing efforts to come to an agreement. Instead, even limited peace talks have been thwarted before they truly begin.

A military draft in Europe is far more likely to succeed, given the socialist nature of the population and the fact that only a tiny percentage of civilians are armed to defend themselves. Even with a public protest movement I have little doubt EU governments will be able to secure a large enough force to send into Ukraine and escalate the war.

According to the evidence, it’s clear that some NATO troops have already been deployed to Ukraine and have been there for some time.As I’ve noted in past articles, the strategies used during the first Ukrainian counter-attack were far too advanced for Ukrainian troops and leadership to pull off without help. Anti-armor tactics in particular were very familiar; similar in execution to tactics used by US and British special forces. Not surprisingly, as soon as foreign mercenary recruit rates dropped off, Ukraine’s momentum fizzled.

The Russians are likely well aware of this situation, but as long as smaller groups of soldiers can be sent under the guise of mercenary forces, there’s not much they can do about it. It’s the open deployment of NATO battalions that is cause for greater worry.

There is zero basis for the domino narrative. Not once has Russia indicated since the start of the conflict that they intend to invade the EU. In fact, Putin has long stated that the war in Ukraine is about protecting the separatists of the Donbas region from Ukrainian reprisal, and about the continued escalation of NATO armament.

My suspicions about Putin’s connections to the globalists aside, if we look at the war from a basic cost/benefit analysisthere is really nothing for Russia to gain by threatening Europe.

Then there’s the problem of logistics. If Russia is supposedly struggling in Ukraine, how could they have the means to fight on an expanded front against the combined military might of Europe and the US? The only end result would be nuclear war, which both sides would lose. But if you look at the situation objectively, there is a group of people out there that have a lot to gain…

Smaller attacks on Russian supplies as well as civilians have been escalating in the past month. The terror attack in Moscow (which US intel blames on ISIS) resulted in the deaths of at least 130 people and drone attacks are threatening oil depots along with other resources. In the grand scheme of the war these attacks are inconsequential, but they will undoubtedly lead to extensive bombardment of Ukrainian cities and the further disablement of Ukrainian infrastructure. Power, water and other utilities will be destroyed and a resource crisis will ensue.

Compared to the US invasion of Iraq, Russia has managed to keep civilian casualties in Ukraine very low.But, each new attack on Russian soil instigates a larger Russian retaliation. And maybe this is the goal – To get the Russians to crater a larger Ukrainian population center thereby giving NATO an excuse to send troops to the region.

In the Middle East the primary driver for international involvement is oil. We all know this.But oil access is not the end goal to the war in Gaza, just a mechanism for getting the US involved.

I’ll reiterate here that I don’t care which side started the fight or how far back the conflict supposedly goes in history. This is irrelevant. What I do know is that Hamas started this particular war by killing civilians in Israel and you should not start a war unless you’re willing to accept the consequences. That said, I do find it suspicious that Israel’s defensive measures were so useless that they were completely unaware of the Hamas incursion until it was too late.

In any case the conflagration is guaranteed to bring in other larger military elements.Iran is going to enter the fray now, there’s no way around it. This might happen first in the form of economic warfare, and the Strait of Hormuz is the most likely target. Shutting down 30% of the world’s oil traffic would be disastrous for the west. So, America’s entry is thus also guaranteed.

Joe Biden has been struggling for the past three years to manipulate oil prices down by dumping strategic reserves on the market. By artificially keeping oil prices down he keeps energy prices down, and by keeping energy prices down he reduces the growth of CPI.

The Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil depots have helped to spike gas prices in the past month exactly because Russian oil is still being purchased by western countries through back channels. You can’t just cut off one of the largest energy suppliers in the world without huge effects on prices at the pump. And these attacks are revealing how sensitive the oil market is to the slightest threat to supply.

Any major conflict in the Middle East will seal the deal and gas prices will explode. Inflation is not just going to be the death knell of Biden’s presidency (assuming presidential elections still matter), it’s going to be the death knell of the leftists and globalists overall UNLESS they can delay a larger economic calamity until they have a scapegoat, or, until they can start a massive war.

That scapegoat will either be Trump and conservatives, or, Russia and the BRICS (or both).If Trump replaces Biden in 2025 then a crash will be fast and assured and it will be blamed on conservative movements. If Biden stays in a crash will be slower but will still hit hard after it can be blamed on the widening wars.

Then there’s the scenario of globalists securing a war BEFORE elections take place. Perhaps with the intention of preventing or delaying the vote. Perhaps with the intention of creating enough chaos that the vote can be rigged, or giving the impression that it was rigged, triggering civil unrest. Perhaps with the intention of declaring martial law.

Obviously, this is where the globalists benefit; either by preventing conservatives from taking power or by embroiling conservatives in a global calamity that they eventually get blamed for. Keep in mind that any conservative/independent opposition to the globalist establishment can now be accused of “Russian collusion.”

What’s the value of this? Well, it’s an age-old strategy for demonizing freedom fighters – If they are seen by the public as fellow citizens fighting for their rights, then they might be treated as heroes. But, if they’re painted as foreign assests and terrorists seeking to destabilize society, then the public sees them as villains. It’s just another advantage that explains why globalists seem so intent on creating a world war.

I believe that the reason the establishment is pressing so hard for WWIII is partly because of the upcoming elections and also because their covid agenda failed.Covid lockdowns and the vaccine passport system were their big play to create a permanent authoritarian environment with the ability to crush conservative groups that refused to submit. And no matter how you slice it they didn’t get what they wanted. World war is the natural Plan B.

It’s important to understand that every crisis created by globalists is meant to destroy the freedom minded. The true target is not Russia or Iran; they are peripheral. These events are designed to create an environment conducive to tyranny, they act as cover for engineered economic collapse, and they act as cover for the REAL war against those people that still defend liberty.

You could say that WWIII has already started, at least in economic terms.I also highly doubt that the end game for the globalists is a worldwide nuclear exchange; why spend decades building a massive control grid only to vaporize it all in seconds? I do think the danger of kinetic warfare is skyrocketing and that US and European citizens will be directly affected. It will take a sizable resistance movement to change the path we are being forced to follow, and things will get much worse before they get better.

Authored by Kevin Dolan at EXIT

COVID caused baby boom in red states, baby bust in blue states

Scientific American says “the findings suggest that the degree to which states or regions took the virus ‘seriously’ affected whether they were likely to see a drop or bump in fertility rate”.

In the big picture, fertility is declining rapidly in all of these states and none are above replacement in the aggregate, so this isn’t cause for red-state triumphalism — but it does support the thesis thatWestern infertility is mostly memetic, and therefore not inevitable.

Our people tend to think of the demographic crisis as depicted in the movieIdiocracy: smart people descending inexorably into neurotic barrenness, while the stupid breed like rabbits.

But whatever proxy for IQ you choose, the story falls apart upon inspection.Everygroup that comes to the US or Europe and imbibes the local culture is effectively sterilized within two generations.

Education, socioeconomic status, IQ, etc. are relevant because the sterilizing memes hit rich, educated, high-IQ populationsfirst,but it’s not obvious that it hits them any harder.

The middle class aren’t having kids, but neither are the poor — except at the very bottom of the distribution, where they are (barely) at replacement, with 100% subsidies of housing, food and healthcare.

(Anyone who recommends handing people money to have kids should explain why it will work better than this.)

Meanwhile, the fertility rates at the upper end of the income distribution — among a very small but culturally influential population — demonstrates that “rich/smart/high-status = barren” is an oversimplification.

And all of these statistics give the misleading impression that these populations are all slowly declining together — but what is actually happening is a world-historic selection event:

According to this figure, one-third of the population will be excluded from the next generation, and the 20% of families with three or more children will produce 50% of the next generation. (That’s a minimum estimate, using the lowball assumption that the average size of 5+ families is 5.)

If you really wanted to stretch, you could argue that our economic situation is so awful that only families making $1,000,000 a year can afford to have 2.1 kids, but having spent many years deep in the trough of the middle-class income distribution, I can tell you that it’s silly.

Middle and upper-middle class people can certainly afford kids — but they are unable or unwilling to have them for cultural reasons.

First, men and women are struggling to pair off, because (as noted by Brit Benjamin at NatalCon 2023) marriage has become an unenforceable contract, so the financial and personal risk involved is unsustainable.

This means that people take a long time — too long — to choose and vet romantic partners. Many age out of childbearing having never met The One.

Among those who find a viable partner, themedian age of first-time American moms is 30, at which point a lot of things have to go right (professional, marital, medical) for the couple to make it to three children.

Median personal income in the US is about $55K, and childcare costs about $10K per year per child. Even with the massive de facto childcare subsidy provided by public schools,most families can’t afford to spend $30,000 on childcarefor the first five years.

And the public school “subsidy” is mostly illusory anyway, since sending your kids to a school where they’ll actually be safe and educated requires you to buy a massively overvalued house “for the schools”. (Liz Warren wrote a book about thisback when libs were allowed to notice things.)

One of the funniest examples of this phenomenon is Medina, Washington, where Bill Gates dumped millions of dollars into the local school district (so he could give his kids an elite experience but still claim that they “went to public school”), and now Seattle strivers rent empty apartments on Mercer Island so they can send their kids to Gates’ personal public school district. (Now that the Gates kids are grown, of course, the spigot has run dry and the district isstruggling to keep up appearances.)

The decision to be a middle-class working mom of three is a decision to earn less than burger-flipper wages for five years, and then either sign on to the most burdensome mortgage and commute you can afford, or send your kids to a gladiator school. Unsurprising that few take that deal.

The two problems are linked, of course: if marriage establishes no real social or contractual obligations, it is difficult to justify the risk of creating an integrated (and mutually dependent)family. So most people build separate, air-gapped economic lives where they don’t actually need each other — their“marriage” is largely a gesture of sentiment and a tax vehicle.

The doomers have a point:you can’t fully escape these problems just by being individually smart and competent. The collapse of single-earner families hasintroduced social and financial costs that affect everyone.

You have to earn a salary for one, while paying a mortgage priced for two, in a neighborhood where most kids are being raised by the state.

If you bug out to the country, your kids will besurrounded by the same dysfunction you find everywhere else.

If you can afford to live in a fancy neighborhood on a single income, and your wife brings your kids down to the clean, well-funded public park during the day, instead of meeting other moms she will mostly encounter foreign nannies.

There’s nowhere to run.

These are the systems by which a culture replicates itself. If it cannot accomplish these basic tasks, it will collapse — no matter what else it does.

The infrastructure of Western society has now organized around a new default life-path for men and women that is incompatible with family life, so it cannot reproduce itself. It only survives by consuming the families of healthier cultures — and it is rapidlyrunning out of other people’s kids.

developing marketable skills outside public school and academia

networking to build businesses and find work for our guys

connecting people who want kids and grandkids

building communities that support raising a family

These are roughly in order of complexity.EXITis intended to address #1 and #2 directly, and lay the groundwork for #3 and #4.Natal Conferenceis our first attack on #3, andwhat we are building in Texaswill serve as a blueprint for #4.

It’s a huge task:restarting the engine of civilization at minimum viable scale. We can’t stop the flood, but if we work together maybe we can build a boat.

Last week on our full-group call, we discussed“How to Live Near Your Friends”— and, more broadly, how/whether we can adapt rich atomized techbro digital-nomad networking paradigms to our purposes.

In the Hot Seat, we pull together the resources and connections of the group to help one member with his EXIT plan. Tonight, we’ll be running aHot Seatfor a young man who is preparing to leave his FAANG job, go into business for himself, and start a family.

2024-04-06 07:00:00,"German Intel Chief Defends His Efforts To Police The ""Thought And Speech Patterns"" Of Citizens",https://web.archive.org/web/20240406124235/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/german-intel-chief-defends-his-efforts-police-thought-and-speech-patterns-citizens#comment-stream,"Authored by  'Eugyppius' via Substack,

The German Interior Ministry continues to defendits controversial and widely criticised plansto restrict the speech, travel and economic activity of political dissidents.The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), our domestic intelligence service and political police, have sacrificed substantial popular regard in the face of this campaign. According to a poll published last month,a plurality of Germans believe that the BfV is being misused for political purposes. The sentiment is prominent across all parties, except of course for the Greens, who believe that all is well with the Federal Republic.

The creepy, dissolute and rodent-looking BfV chief, Thomas Haldenwang, has taken to the pages of theFrankfurter Allgemeineto defend the conduct of his office and his plans to shape the “thought and speech patterns” of ordinary people through official repression.

The thing about “freedom of expression,” Haldenwangexplains, is that it “is not carte blanche for enemies of the constitution”.

Recently, public discourse has repeatedly featured headlines and articles calling the work of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) into question. There is talk of an “opinion police,” a “language police” and even a “Government security service”. They say the BfV discredits political opinions “on command” as extremist as soon as they depart from the social and political mainstream, or when they embark upon criticism of Government action or the work of the democratic parties.

One thing should be unmistakably clear: freedom of opinion prevails in Germany – and that is a good thing!Freedom of opinion is a fundamental element of our constitution and one of the greatest assets of our liberal democratic order. As such, it is also protected by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.

“Freedom of opinion,” Haldenwang explains, is what “distinguishes a democracy from an autocracy or a dictatorship.” In the Federal Republic even “offensive, absurd and radical opinions” are protected.

In theory, you can think and say whatever you want in Germany, so long as what you think and say does not violate the law. Within the range of legal expression, however, there is a grey area that Haldenwang and his minders in the Interior Ministry get to define. If you enter this danger zone, you may end up inviting the unwelcome attention of the political police even though you have not broken any laws.

Put less charitably, there is clearly illegal speech on the one hand, and on the other hand there is speech which is alas not yet illegal, but which existing authorities will use all the administrative tools at their disposal to dissuade you from. Such speech, we might say, is pre-illegal, and only reluctantly permitted because the hurdles to banning it are too substantial.

Specifically, you become susceptible to surveillance and harassment by the BfV whenever you express opinions that suggest you are interested in “eliminat[ing] the free democratic order” of the Federal Republic.Your mere freedom of expression is “not a licence to evade observation and evaluation” by the political police if there are “factual indications” that your thought is tending in unconstitutional directions.

Unsurprisingly, the scope of what is “unconstitutional” in thought and speech turns out very wide indeed:

For example, if elements of our free democratic basic order are attacked, e.g. if the human dignity of members of certain social groups or political actors is violated, if permissible criticism and democratic protest escalates and turns into aggressive,systematic delegitimisation of state conduct(including calls for violence), when legitimate criticism and opinions turn into extremist agitation intended to shake the foundations of our democratic order and thus prepare the ground for unpeaceful and violent activities – such statements can constitute evidence of endeavours directed against the free democratic order.

As Iposted last month, the BfV has been targeting political dissidents it deems guilty of “delegitimising” the state since 2021 – a concept that takes aim at a wide range of expression and that reminds one of defunct DDR laws against “defaming the state”. Here, Haldenwang quietly expands this concept, explaining that you may become a case for the BfV if your “permissible criticism” crosses some invisible boundary to become the “delegitimisation of state conduct”. Comparing the Federal Republic to the DDR is an example of delegitimising the state; comparing the behaviour of the BfV to the behaviour of the Stasi is presumably an example of delegitimising state conduct. The goal here is to make it effectively impossible to criticise the German Government for its antidemocratic and unconstitutional policies without drawing the attention of the BfV, because attacking our nominally democratic leaders for antidemocratic behaviour is the very definition of “delegitimisation”.

Otherwise, to understand how ominous this is, you must remember that the present political establishment in general, and the BfV and Haldenwang more specifically, exercise a total sovereignty of interpretation over everything you say.It doesn’t matter whether you intend to violate “the human dignity of members of certain social groups” with your statements, or even if this is a remotely defensible interpretation of your words. It only matters if the constitutional protectors decide you are guilty of doing so. Thus if our constitutional protectors decide that your statements are “intended” to call into question “our democratic order” or “prepare the ground for unpeaceful and violent activities”, you’re on the radar of the BfV, regardless of what you said or how you meant it. This is a licence to go after anyone saying anything our political leaders don’t like.

Haldenwang believes that “in the post-War history of our country, democracy has rarely been in such danger as it is now”.

This is because “the number of extremists and the potential for extremism have been on the rise for years”, because “digitalisation and virtualisation” are helping bad people “spread their ideologies”,and because “authoritarian states” are propagating “disinformation” which “often meets with approval and applause from domestic organisations and actors”.

What Haldenwang is really terrified about, of course, are the upcoming elections for the EU Parliament and for the state parliaments of Brandenburg, Thüringen and Saxony.

That is why we have to read so much in the press every day about “Right-wing extremism”,why the police are going after 17-year-old girls who post AfD Smurf videos to TikTokandinvestigating inflatable snowmen for fascismandwhy leading Green politicians are having ordinary people prosecuted for political satire.

In the Federal Republic there is nothing so threatening to democracy as free and open democratic elections.

2024-04-06 07:35:00,French Pilots To Go On Strike Against Government's Proposal To Ban Strikes,https://web.archive.org/web/20240406124235/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/french-pilots-go-strike-against-governments-proposal-ban-strikes,"It's been a week full of absurd news and this certainly is a fitting end to it.

At a time when workers around the world are striking and demanding higher pay left and right to keep up with soaring prices, the Air France pilot union is doing the same... only with a twist: this strike isn’t due to any current labor issues between the union and company, but rather due to a new government bill that’s currently under consideration; as suchthe pilots are about to go on strike over a government’s proposed ban on strikes.

As View from the Wing reports, the French government is considering a ban on strikes “over fixed periods, up to 60 days per year"" and the French Senate will debate the proposed bill April 9th. In France, strikes are often timed to maximize the impact they have on customers, so the government’s goal is to presumably limit strikes over the busiest periods, especially in the transportation sector (the upcoming Summer Olympics in Paris may also factor into this).

Meanwhile, the SPAF pilot union (Syndicat des Pilotes du groupe Air France), which represents pilots at Air France, believes that Air France is not public transport and not engaged in public service,and thus their right to strike shouldn’t be constrained to benefit the public.Doing otherwise “would “relegate” the country to an authoritarian state” according to the pilots who clearly are unaware that France was relegated to an authoritarian state long ago.

And since the union “cannot accept” such ""authoritarian"" legislation they are calling on all French pilots to strike April 15-16.

The pilots maintain that there’s a separation between the airline and society, and that they don’t owe a duty to the French public – yet their own actions undermine the claim. They say Air France is private, this new potential policy is government, and they’re protesting the government policy by striking… against the airline.

Meanwhile, it’s surreal to suggest that:

The French government is the primary owner of Air France and heavily involved in French labor relations. New legislation threatens to tinker with rules that would limit harm to French citizens from strikes at this business that’s been deemed systemically and socially important (hence billions in subsidies from citizens). With this change, if it were to come to pass, French law would still tilt heavily towards workers.

Meanwhile, Air France pilots are not the downtrodden souls union workers normally want to be seen as: ""these aren’t factory workers during the industrial revolution"", as VFTW points out. On average Air France pilots earn around $160,000 with senior captains frequently earning in excess of $250,000 per year. And since French per capita GDP is half that of the United States, these numbers are even more impressive.

Bottom line: French pilots striking to push for government policies protecting their privileged positions at the expense of average citizens is an awkward position to be in, but come to think of it not all that different than ALPA in the United States.

2024-04-06 08:10:00,Europe's South Takes The Lead,https://web.archive.org/web/20240406124235/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/europes-south-takes-lead,"By Maartje Wijffelaars, Senior Economist at Rabobank

Brent crude oil extended its gains and broke through the 90 dollars a barrel threshold yesterday, for the first time since end-October last year. The commodity continues its ascend this morning and at the time of writing it’ll cost you 91.2 dollars to buy a barrel. And more support for the commodity is on the table if Russia and Iraq actually stick to the production quotas. Indeed, on Wednesday OPEC+ decided to extend its production cuts through June, but Russia and Iran have produced more than agreed recently. Ukraine strikes on Russian production facilities over the past weeks could ‘help’ Russia lowering its exports, as sites are down. The exact amount of damage is unknown, however, with multiple different figures going around.

Apart from a tighter market, rising uncertainty in the Middle East have fed oil prices since Monday. At the start of the week, Israel hit Iranian military officials in Syria, stoking fears of an escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict into the broader region.

Yesterday’sECB accountsof its March meeting showed that uncertainties with respect to the developments of energy prices are on the ECB’s radar. Specifically they mentioned that“Upside risks to inflation included the heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade.”And that“It was important to keep in mind that wrong assumptions on energy prices would eventually feed through to all inflation components, either through input prices or indirectly, via wages.”

Overall, the accounts strongly point to a June move, but also underscore the likelihood of a cautious approach for the trajectory afterwards. For more on our ECB view please keep an eye on the preview for next week’s meeting our ECB watcher Bas van Geffen will send out today.

Meanwhile, yesterday’s PMI figures for March narrowly lifted activity in the Eurozone to expansionary territory, for the first time since May 2023. The composite figure came in at 50.3, despite an accelerated contraction in manufacturing (46.1), owing to improved conditions in the services sector on the back of rising new orders, output and employment (51.5).

Indices for individual member states continued to show quite some divergence among member states. Specifically, they showed that things are going rather well in the South, with a composite PMI of 55.3 in Spain and 53.5 in Italy, but (still) not too good in Germany (47.7) and France (48.3). It’s a story that has been playing out for quite some time now due to a multitude of both longer- and shorter-term reasons.

For example, Germany has been struggling with low demand in China and a loss in competitiveness not only due to the ‘recent’ surge in gas prices, but also due to relatively high labour cost growth – outpacing that of many peers for years now – and increased competition from Chinese car manufacturers. A very tight labour market has also been putting a lid on business’ abilities to grow.

Meanwhile, Italy has benefitted from increased competitiveness due to both relatively weaker wage growth and quality gains over the past years, supporting export growth. Indeed, it’s real effective exchange rate based on relative unit labour costs has been steadily in decline since the GFC. It has furthermore been able to tap into high-growth niche markets such as maritime transport production and has suffered less than Germany from supply chain disruptions during the pandemic.

Another important driver of Italy’s post-pandemic boom is the Superbonus tax credit scheme which hasfuelled construction investmentsince 2020 – support from the latter is expected to come to end, however, as the scheme is being faced out. Finally, Italy has benefitted from EU grants from the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) – also known as the EU pandemic recovery fund. Conditional on reform and investment progress, it is entitled to grants worth in total EUR 72bn (3.4% of 2023 GDP). So far it has received just over half of the amount it’s eligible to, although part of that money isstill waiting to be spend.

Both wage moderation and significant support from the EU recovery fund have also helped Spain. The latter is entitled to as much as EUR 80bn in EU grants (5.5% of 2023 GDP) and has so far received a little less than half, although not all money received has been spent yet. More beneficial demographic developments have also helped Spain when compared to both Germany and Italy - this partly results from immigration. Another important factor of Spain’s more recent outperformance is that it has been playing catch up lately. It took longer for its hospitality and tourism driven economy to pick up from the pandemic slump. Furthermore, while its relatively small industrial sector – with a relatively strong focus on car manufacturing – has meant that Spain’s economy benefitted less from the strong industrial production growth during the pandemic years, past year(s)’ slump in the sector has also acted as a smaller drag.

German factory orders for February (0.2% m/m and -10.6% y/y) and industrial production in France (0.2% m/m and -0.8% y/y), out this morning, confirmed both countries’ rather weak start to the year. Yes, both saw a minor monthly uptick after a major contraction in January, but performance was worse than expected and in year-on-year terms both indicators weakened compared to January. At the same time, Spain’s industrial output in February exceeded expectations and picked up both compared to January (0.7% m/m after 0.4% m/m in January) and a year ago (+1.5% y/y in February after -0.6% y/y in January).

On a positive note, figures for Germany, France, and the Eurozone were upwardly revised from preliminary estimates. This suggests that the economy gained some steam in the final weeks of the quarter. This suggests growth in the Eurozone is likely to pick up in Q2, from a rather flat start this year. This is in line with our forecast, as private spending is projected to benefit from improved household purchasing power and a decline in long-term interest rates, while investment in general will be supported by the RRF funds – especially in Southern member states. Overall, Spain is expected to largely outperform peers this and next year, while France and Italy are projected to perform broadly in line with the Eurozone average;  Germany is to underperform.

Arabica coffee futures with May delivery jumped 12.5% on the week (the largest weekly gain since July 2021), closing at $2.12 per pound.

The contract is at its highest level since early October 2022.

As for weekly CFTC data on futures and options, managed money-only long contracts hit a record high.

""The current move can largely be attributed to a heat wave in Vietnam affecting Robusta coffee production and as a result, providing carryover support for premium Arabica beans,"" Aakash Doshi, senior commodities strategist at Citi, wrote in a note to clients.

Doshi forecasts Arabica coffee futures to be trading between $1.88 and $2.15 through the 2024 calendar year. He indicated prices could go higher if the physical outlook tightens.

Separately, Hernando De La Roche, a senior vice president at StoneX Financial Inc., told Bloomberg that dealers were caught in a vicious ""short and forced to cover while funds have been adding long positions,"" adding that importers were forced to abandon hedges.

Meanwhile, the recent surge in Brent crude prices due to the worsening geopolitical situation in the Middle East could begin to lift global food prices.

Food inflation is not going away. This is more bad news for central banks.

2024-04-06 16:26:09,Why Central Banks Want the Gold,https://web.archive.org/web/20240408112119/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-06/why-central-banks-want-gold,"Authored byGoldFixZH Edit

Title piece from April 5, 2023 has proven prescient and even growing in importance as the rest of the world media slowly catches up to the reality of things. The other segments below cover closely related topics in light of Gold and now Silver’s resurgence. Enjoy

[Transcribed frompodcast.]

This is the beautiful part about gold.

We all get sucked into the correlations. We live by them.

Things you read and follow like:

But that's because when gold's been demonetized or has no genuine use-case--as it has been for the better part of 50 years--it is a pet rock.It isn't needed when everyone trusts every one else with their money. It's an opportunity cost asset. Its an imperfect hedge for a plethora of risks, but wildly unpredictable for any one risk.

But now they want the goldbecause they need the gold to transact business across international lines. That's what's going on.

Warranted or not,ground zero for this change in priorities was the US confiscation of Russia's Forex and Treasury Wealth. Now nobody trusts anybody.

So interest rates may alter speed of Gold price going up, but it will not change the direction. At least not until everyone has enough gold that needs it for international trade. Gold has already revalued itself against every currency in the world except for the dollar.

And the dollar is coming next. That's basically it.Gold going up, even with the dollar going nowhereis a reflection of the dollar's buying power going down internationally, among other things. But I'm telling you, I remember that from a mentor explaining whycorrelations do not matter when you absolutely need to own something.Back then I was like:

But, the dollar's doing this.The yen's doing that.

And the guy would just say:

Vince, they don't f*cking care about your correlation. A central bank wants the gold. They don't care. And  neither do I. I have to find some to buy for them.. [click]

You need gold to transact across borders now as clean,uncorrupted collateral, and soon that will apply to Silver.  Which is why you also need Bitcoin as an entity who needs to trade internationally

“We are entering an era where all correlations mean nothing because financial markets have abused correlation between assets. In the future I think what will determine the price of an asset is going to be more and more based on the actual asset’s utility. Not a financial correlation or relationship to dollars  or stocks, or anything else used to measure global assets as merely dollar minions.

When gold goes up in dollar terms in the future it goes up itwill be because they want the goldnot because someone is  shorting dollars. Remember correlations are useless in a real market. Think about oil. That's a real market in which they need the oil for obvious reasons.Gold hasn't been a real market for years. You didn't need the gold. You needed the benefits of the gold. But what happens when they need the actual gold?”

All correlations are man-made. When an option on amc has a two Delta, and goes in the money two days later that “2 delta” correlation was worthless. The world is changing. Non-Bayesian Statistics will lead you to ruin.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;

2024-04-06 16:55:00,Hartnett: Explosion In Gold Shows Investors Are Preparing For The Endgame,https://web.archive.org/web/20240407121010/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/hartnett-explosion-gold-shows-investors-are-preparing-endgame,"Earlier this weekwe noted that back in the start of 2022, something snapped in the long-term correlation between gold and real rates: as BBG's Garfield Reynolds pointed out, gold’s recent - and ongoing - surge to record highs was quite extraordinary as it is coming in the face of elevated real yields (which at 2% are at levels not seen since 2009, when gold was trading below $1000)that would normally bring it crashing down.

That, to Reynolds, the fact that real yields are the highest in 15 years -a level which should hurt a non-interest bearing asset like gold, but clearly doesn't- signals one of two outcomes: i) either the metal is likely to rapidly reverse this year’s staggering ascent, or ii) risk assets are due to collapse because of an economic or financial crisis.

2024-04-06 17:30:00,SEC Forced To Halt Climate Reporting Mandate For Businesses,https://web.archive.org/web/20240407121010/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/sec-forced-halt-climate-reporting-mandate-businesses#comment-stream,"Authored by Naveen Athrappully via The Epoch Times,

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)paused the implementation of its climate disclosure requirements for companies as legal challenges against the rules are pending in a circuit court.

In March, the SECfinalizeda controversial rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose any climate-related risks to their business. The SEC’s Final Rules also required some midsize and large firms to reveal how much CO2 is emitted from their operations. This led to several Republican states, companies, and business groups filing lawsuits against the regulations, asking for the SEC rule to be stayed. Two energy companies—Liberty Energy Inc. and Nomad Proppant Services LLC—sought an administrative stay on the rule, which was granted by the Fifth Circuit court on March 15.

According to SEC rules, businesses must report on the potential impact climate risks may have on their financial condition as well as the strategies undertaken to mitigate such risks. Businesses have to disclose their climate targets and the losses suffered due to severe weather events.

Other legal challenges against the rule were filed at the Second, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuit courts. All the lawsuits, including the Fifth Circuit one, were consolidated into a single case, with the Eight Circuit set to hear thechallenge.

On March 26, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Texas Association of Business, and the Longview Chamber of Commerce filed a motion in the Eighth Circuit, seeking a stay of the SEC rules pending judicial review.

Lawsuits from Republican statesclaimthat the SEC breached their rule-making authority by asking public firms to disclose climate risks while such regulations have not received approval from Congress.

SEC’s rules create costly, unnecessary “red tape” for businesses.They accused the climate rules of being part of the Biden administration’s push to make sure investment decisions in the country are driven by climate considerations rather than financial returns.

On April 4, SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman issued anorderstaying the agency’s climate rule requirements while litigation proceeded in the Eighth Circuit.

Ms. Countryman argued that given the procedural complexities involved in litigating the multiple cases filed against the climate rules, the SEC’s stay “will facilitate the orderly judicial resolution of those challenges.”

In addition, “a stay avoids potential regulatory uncertainty if registrants were to become subject to the Final Rules’ requirements during the pendency of the challenges to their validity.”

Though the SEC is issuing a stay on the climate rule, the agency continues to hold the view that the regulations are “consistent with applicable law” and within the authority of the commission, the order stated.

“Thus, the Commission will continue vigorously defending the Final Rules’ validity in court and looks forward to expeditious resolution of the litigation.”

Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, one of the Republican AGs that led 25 states to file lawsuits against the climate rules, called the SEC’s April 4 stay a “victory” that “shuts down the most outrageous climate mandate for businesses since Biden took office.”

“The SEC’s job is to protect people from fraud. It has no business slapping companies with extremist climate mandates. We are making it clear that Biden has to follow the law like everyone else,”she said.

“By halting this mandate, we are protecting businesses from costly red tape, securing our supply chain, and defending family farms. Next, we are going to make this win permanent!”

In addition to Iowa, other states in the lawsuit are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

The SEC rule “will also require businesses to disclose climate-related risks, including higher insurance rates from weather disasters, and release a plan to adapt to climate-agenda recommendations.The plan is estimated to cost businesses billions of dollars every year.”

When the SEC finalized its climate rules in March, agency commissioners had voted 3–2 to pass the measure. The votes were done along party lines, with all Democrats voting in favor of the rule and Republican commissioners voting against it.

Republican commissioner Hester Peirce had pointed out that the climate rules would be expensive and burdensome for businesses while creating a large amount of inconsistent information overwhelming investors.

“However well-intentioned, these particularized interests don’t justify forcing investors who don’t share them to foot the bill,”he said.The SEC estimates the climate rule to impact around 2,800 American firms.

The rules adopted in March were a watered-down version of an earlier draft that contained more stringent measures, including requiring companies to report certain indirect emissions. These stringent measures triggered intense opposition from the business community.

In an interview withThe Epoch Timesin June 2022, Sean Griffith, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, suggested that SEC rules enforce viewpoint discrimination since the regulations are essentially forcing companies to endorse certain assumptions about how the earth’s climate is being affected by human actions.

“The reason why the climate rules are so problematic is that either they’re politically driven—which is very plausible—or they are driven by this desire to appease the institutional asset manager community, which has its own profit interest because they generate revenue from the assets under management of those ESG portfolios. At the end of the day, it’s not about investors.”

2024-04-06 18:05:00,Next Big Mineral Trade Revealed By Morgan Stanley,https://web.archive.org/web/20240407121010/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/next-big-mineral-trade-revealed-morgan-stanley#comment-stream,"Abandoning petrol-burning vehicles and adopting low-­carbon technologies to power tomorrow's economy are trends accelerating across the nation. To do this, access to rare earth metals, key ingredients in many of these 'green' technologies, must be sourced domestically - not from China, an emerging national security threat to the US. As the world fractures into a multipolar state, there is a big push domestically to revive America's metals and mining industry and reduce reliance on Asia.

Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba recently conveyed his optimistic outlook for the US metals and mining sector to clients. He highlighted that investment levels in the industry have reached their lowest level in decades. He believes the sector is poised for massive investments and outlines the companies that will benefit.

""US reliance on import critical minerals has reached a 30-year high, and investment in the industry is near its lowest point in decades,"" the analyst said, pointing out America's heavy reliance on imported minerals from China:

""The US government has identified 50 minerals it deems critical to the US economy and to national security; for 43 of those critical minerals, more than 50% of domestic consumption depends on imports.

Since 1990, the US has seen a significant increase in both the variety of imported minerals and the level of dependence on these imports. In 1990, the US was fully reliant on imports for the supply of 9 minerals, and imports exceeded 50% of consumption for 27 minerals (including all minerals, not only critical ones).

These figures have risen to 15 and 51, respectively, as of 2022. China currently dominates the global mineral processing/refining industry, and the US is heavily reliant on China (>50% of net import reliance) for imports of 26 minerals.""

China's global dominance in rare earth metals is a national security threat. Were Western leaders asleep at the wheel over the last three-plus decades to allow this to happen?

The analyst detailed how China dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals and cautioned against rising vulnerabilities in US mineral supply chains, especially given the ongoing tensions in Sino-US relations:

""China is in a powerful position to influence the global mineral markets and has already started to flex its strength through mineral export restrictions. For US policymakers, the US's mineral dependence on imports highlights the growing vulnerability of the US mineral supply chain and the urgent need to strengthen domestic supply chains. In addition, the US faces a multi-decade decline in investment in the domestic mining and exploration industry, which has fallen from ~2.0% of GDP in 1960 (and a peak of ~3.1% in 1981) to just ~0.5% today.""

After being asleep at the wheel for decades, the bloated US government, thank former President Trump - has awakened from its slumber and realized that it must play a serious ""catch-up"" game with policy reform and incentives for private industry to rebuild America's domestic mining and separation sector.

""US permitting reform and other government incentives will likely act as a tailwind for the domestic mining industry through encouraging the development and helping mitigate the associated risks of building new mine supply,"" the analyst said.

He said the big winner of ""permitting reform"" that is ""geared toward promoting the development of mining projects"" will be the ""Junior Mining and Exploration industry.""

One company that stands to benefit is MP Materials, the largest US-based miner of rare earths. The analyst said this company is a ""play on accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and electrification trends in wind turbines.""

""The company's mission is to restore the full US rare earth supply chain. MP has executed on its plan of restarting the Mountain Pass mine in California and it is currently ramping a refining facility to produce rare earth oxides. The company will get into the production of NdFeB alloy flake and permanent mag-nets (critical components for electric vehicles and wind turbines) with a plant that is under construction in Texas.""

Shares of MP Materials have roundtripped Covid lows.

He said Cleveland-Cliffs Inc and United States Steel Corporation are ""key beneficiaries to building ex-China supply chains given CLF is currently the only producer of electrical steel in the US and X is ramping up a greenfield electrical steel facility this year.""

He added: ""All steel names under our coverage (NUE, STLD, CLF and X) will broadly benefit from re-shoring trends given manufacturing facilities, and the equipment to outfit them is often steel intensive.""

And the analyst listed a few junior miners with assets in the US that should interest investors:

American Rare Earths Ltd (ARR.AX | Market Cap ~A$138 million): ARR is a rare earth exploration & development company. Their 100% owned flagship project, Halleck Creek deposit, is located in Wyoming and has extensive rare earth mineralization. According to the company, the project has the potential to be amongst the largest rare earth deposits in the US

USA Rare Earth (Private):According to USA Rare Earth, the company owns the only scalable, sintered neo-magnet manufacturing system in the Western Hemisphere (located in Oklahoma). The company is targeting magnet production in 2024 and is aiming to supply the plant with rare earth feed stock mined from the Round Top property in Texas in late 2025 or early 2026. USA Rare Earth owns an 80% stake in the Round Top property, Texas Mineral Resources (OTCBQ: TMRC) owns the remaining 20% stake.

Perpetua Resources (PPTA.TO | Market Cap ~C$360 million):Perpetua's flagship development project is the Stibnite Gold Project located in Idaho, which according to the company has one of the largest economic reserves of antimony and could supply ~35% of US demand in the first six years of production. Antimony is considered a critical mineral and is used in batteries, munitions and semiconductors. The company was recently awarded up to $15.5 million in funding for the Department of Defense to help demonstrate a fully domestic antimony trisulfide supply chain.

IperionX Ltd. (IPX.AX, IPX.O | Market Cap ~A$525 million):IperionX goal is to re-shore a fully integrated titanium metal supply chain to the US. The company plans on extracting titanium minerals from its Titan Project in Tennessee, in addition to producing rare earths and zirconium as co-products. The company plans on producing high-performance titanium alloys, from titanium minerals or scrap titanium

In addition to profiting from what could soon be an explosion of investment in the mining sector, we outlined to readers days ago another big trade theme in a note titled""The Next AI Trade.""

2024-04-06 18:40:00,'Animal Spirits' Update (Or Reflections On Another Fake Unemployment Report),https://web.archive.org/web/20240407121010/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/animal-spirits-update-or-reflections-another-fake-unemployment-report,"Authored by Elliott Middleton via 'End Times Meditation' Substack,

The BLS is reporting the March unemployment rate down slightly to 3.8 percent, nowhere near the 4.5 percent that it will take to trigger a collapse of confidence.

ZeroHedgehas detailed how fake the BLS’s numbers have become in a series of recent posts (yesterday’s highlights are hereandhere).

When I was in academics, my research program was on the application of psychology to economics, especially the fundamental psychological law of sensitivity to adaptation level.

Back in the 1990s, I was featured in a front-page article in theWall Street Journalon “animal spirits” or confidence levels.

I discovered that when the unemployment level rises above a 4-year exponential moving average of the unemployment rate (in which more recent observations are weighted more heavily), confidence collapses, the unemployment rate skyrockets upward, and economic activity contracts sharply.

This event marks the end of the business cycle.

While the economy has been stagnating for most people recently, we have not experienced this signal event, the collapse of confidence that occurs when the recession begins.

The post below describes my intellectual journey and was published inZeroHedgeon June 21, 2022, and is highly recommended if you haven’t read it already.

We can expect laughable unemployment reports for the rest of the year. Meanwhile, private industry sources keep track of announced layoffs.

Leading Companies Announcing Layoffs And Hiring Freezes in 2024

Since January 1st, 2024, 151,943+ companies have announced mass layoffs.

[Last update: April 01, 2024]. [emphasis added]

The Biden administration is aware of my work and apparently will do anything to prevent the reported unemployment number from climbing to 4.5 percent before the election, which would trigger a collapse of confidence.

The adaptation level is currently at 4.53 percent. Look at the graph below.

There is still a gap of 4.53 - 3.8 = 0.73 unemployment percentage points,too wide for people to feel that “things are getting worse than what we’re used to.”

The difference between the unemployment rate and the adaptation level can be flipped to be presented as a confidence level.By this metric, confidence is still quite high (though trending lower).

Real per capita personal income is almost exactly on trend for the past 30 years.

Consumers may have a lingering COVID-bubble-stimmy-checks-induced feeling of wealth as well, having recovered from a dip in 2022.

The recent experience has been nothing like the years following the Great Financial Crisis.

Unfortunately, more fake data from the BLS coming on top of all the fake data from the FDA and CDC over the past four years will only further extinguish any confidence the American people have in their government’s statistical releases. Or in their government in general.

Perhaps the BLS will simply stop reporting an unemployment number. This is what the Chinese did with their youth unemployment series.

Or perhaps they’ll issue a report with all the data redacted like the FDA did with their myocarditis analysis. Every page was redacted.

The “strong” report this morning suggests that rates will stay higher for longer than many expect. Note in the chart below, showing the inflation rate and the 3-month T-bill rate, that the peak in short-term interest rates came a year after the peak in inflation, the last time the Fed was battling with inflation during the 1980-1982 recessions.

With the WEF Cabal pursuing their goal of global famine by destabilizing oil production in the Middle East, thereby especially starving China of the means to run its economy and feed its population, a global oil shock appears to be in the making.

Crunch coming. Will there even be an election?

We are approaching maximum uncertainty.

2024-04-06 20:25:00,Democrat Division Intensifies As Ex-Speaker Pelosi Joins Call For Biden To Stop Arming Israel,https://web.archive.org/web/20240407121010/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/democrat-division-intensifies-ex-house-speaker-pelosi-joins-call-biden-stop-arming-israel#comment-stream,"A divide among Democrats over whether to halt defense aid to Israel is growing more fierce, causing a crisis and headache for Biden strategists ahead of the presidential election, which has only intensified in the wake of last week's Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza, which left seven international workers dead, including an American.

Thisintensifying fragmentation of Biden's basehas been on display this weekend also given former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - still very influential among Dems - has publicly come out against Biden's policy to continue arming Israel. The issue is entering the heart of the Democratic establishment, threatening unity.

Axiosreportsthat she ""signed onto a call by progressive members of Congress for the U.S. to stop transferring weapons to Israelover a strike that killed seven aid workers in Gaza.""

Thelettershe signed, and which was led by Reps. Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), included the signatures of some 40 Democrats.

""In light of the recent strike against aid workers and the ever-worsening humanitarian crisis,we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers,"" the lawmakers stated in the letter addressed to President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

""If this strike is found to have violated U.S. or international law,we urge you to continue withholding these transfers until those responsible are held accountable,"" the lawmakers wrote.

However, a follow-up statement from a Pelosi representative toAxioshas this to say: ""Speaker Pelosi knows President Biden's support for Israel and empathy with the innocent civilians in Gaza, and she respects his judgment in how to proceed.""

This trend of the Gaza war becoming a bright red dividing line among Democrats is also on display with recent stories like the following fromEpoch Times--Pro-Israel Democrat Group Endorses ‘Squad’ Primary Opponents:

A Democrat pro-Israel group has endorsed candidates challenging incumbents who are members of the far-left congressional group “The Squad.”

Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI) announced on April 3 its backing of Westchester County Executive George Latimer and St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell.

DMFI did not state its reasons for backing the two other than through announcinga slateof endorsements.

So now the 'fight' is on and it's becoming a real issue with campaign money lining up on either side. Still, those voters who put the Squad members in office in the first place are more than likely to come down on theanti-Israelside.

Another indicator that the internal Democrat divide is accelerating is that the controversy has completely altered a long-standing White House tradition.Muslim leaders are boycotting an annual White House Ramadan gatheringwhich marks the end of the Muslimseason of fasting:

The Biden administration is hosting a scaled-down Ramadan gathering for Muslim and Arab Americans afterseveral community leaders declined the invite over the unrelenting and steadfast nature of US support for Israel’s waron Gaza.

The event scheduled for Tuesday will be instark contrast to previous Muslim celebrationsand gatherings under the Biden administration, which have seen packed ballrooms of Muslims from all over the country joining the White House festivities.

This year, the iftar will beconfined to staffers only, and a separate gathering will take place for Muslim community members.

U.S. MUSLIMS REJECT BIDEN THIS RAMADANAfter boycotting the White House's annual Iftar invitation, American Muslims staged an Iftar protest outside demanding an end to U.S. arms to Israel & a ceasefire.Muslim community anger in America has risen over the U.S.' loyal…pic.twitter.com/WTbXKELpBh

One such Muslim community leader and activist toldMiddle East Eyethat Palestinian-Americans are""vehemently opposed to any Palestinian, Arab, Muslim, or any person who has an ounce of humanity""attending the event.

All of this is of course a plus for Trump's chances of retaking the White House going into November, also given the Israel-Gaza issue is much less of a divisive flashpoint issue for Republican voters.

2024-04-06 21:00:00,Trump Accuses Biden Of Unfairly Targeting 71-Year-Old Jan. 6 'Hostage',https://web.archive.org/web/20240407121010/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/trump-accuses-biden-unfairly-targeting-71-year-old-jan-6-hostage,"Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Former President Donald Trump has criticized President Joe Biden and the Justice Departmentfor “unfairly” targeting a 71-year-old woman dubbed the “J6 Praying Grandma” who entered the U.S. Capitol for around 10 minutes on Jan. 6, 2021.

Rebecca Lavrenzwas convictedon April 4 on four federal misdemeanor charges, including entering and remaining in a restricted building, and disorderly and disruptive conduct. She faces up to a year in prison and $200,000 in fines, with her sentencing scheduled for Aug. 12.

President Trump took to social media on Friday to denounce the conviction.

“Rebecca Lavrez, also known as the ‘J6 Praying Grandma,’ has been unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ, and now faces up to 1 YEAR in prison for peacefully walking around the Capitol, and praying for our Failing Nation on January 6th!” he wrote in apost on Truth Social.

President Trump said thatMs. Lavrez, a 71-year-old grandmother and small business owner from Colorado, has now become “one of Joe Biden’s J6 HOSTAGES!!!”

President Trump has made the alleged mistreatment of Jan. 6 defendants a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, vowing to use executive power to issue pardons and free Jan. 6 “hostages” soon after taking office, if elected.

“Crooked Joe Biden spends more time prosecuting Patriots like Rebecca, AND ME, than Violent Criminals, Thugs, Murderers, and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS who are destroying our Country. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST,” President Trump added in his post.

President Biden has been sharply critical of President Trump’s statements about the Jan. 6 defendants, whileAttorney General Merrick Garland has promised to press ahead with more Jan. 6 prosecutions—and to cast the Justice Department’s dragnet even more widely to include people who weren’t even present at the Capitol that day.

“As I said before, the Justice Department will hold all January 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under the law—whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Mr. Garland said in a speech on Jan. 5.

More than 1,350 people have been charged with various crimes in relation to the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, ranging from misdemeanor offenses such as trespassing to felonies such as seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers.

Of these, roughly 800 have been sentenced, with nearly two-thirds receiving some time in prison.

Ms. Lavrenz, who calls herself the “J6 Praying Great-Grandma” in her Xaccount bio, was convicted by a federal jury on April 4 on four criminal counts.

After nearly 26 hours of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.

In an April 5 appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” program, Ms.Lavrenz said she only spent 10 minutes inside the Capitol and that she traveled to Washington on Jan. 6 to pray for America’s future.

“I went there to pray,” Ms. Lavrenz told Mr. Bannon. She explained that she was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 “because I love God, my country, and my family, and I knew that something wasn’t right in that 2020 election.”

Ms. Lavrenz was captured on video surveillance entering the Capitol building through the East Rotunda doors, walking around the building, and speaking briefly with a police officer before exiting the building, according to charging documents.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in the complaint against her that Ms. Lavrenz volunteered photos of herself at the Capitol on the day of the breach to FBI agents. The complaint says the Falcon, Colorado, resident “admitted traveling to Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 to attend the ‘Stop the Steal’ rally on the mall and ‘following the crowd to the U.S. Capitol building.’”

In its statement of facts against Ms. Lavrenz, the DOJ said the grandmother of seven entered the building despite seeing physical barriers “indicating the U.S. Capitol building grounds were a restricted area.”

The filing also states that she “observed people getting into physical confrontations with police” and that she “saw a woman get injured in the exchange.” Video evidence confirmed Ms. Lavrenz’s statement that she was inside the building for only 10 minutes, per the court filings.

Several days before the start of her trial, Ms. Lavrenz posted avideoof herself online as she entered the Capitol grounds for the first time since Jan. 6, 2021.

“My own country is treating me like a criminal just because I believe that my—they stole my rightful president, and just standing up for my country makes me a criminal,” she said in the video. “It’s not right. It feels so weird to be here.”

A retired register nurse, Ms. Lavrenz also owns and operates a bed and breakfast near the Rocky Mountains in Falcon, Colorado.

She has set up a GiveSendGocrowdfundingpageto help pay for her legal bills and as of Saturday had received over $82,000 in donations.

2024-04-06 22:10:00,Climate-Con & The Media-Censorship Complex – Part 1,https://web.archive.org/web/20240407121010/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/climate-con-media-censorship-complex-part-1#comment-stream,"Authored by Jesse Smith via TruthUnmuted.org,

The gauntlet has been cast by the media-censorship complex. Just prior to this year’s annual globalist confab in Davos, the World Economic Forum (WEF) announced that misinformation and disinformation are currentlythe greatest threats to humanity, with the release of itsGlobal Risks Report 2024.

From a list of 34 risks, the WEF report identifies mis- and disinformation as the top threats to global stability over the next two years and the fifth most dangerous threats over the next 10 years.Of particular concern is false information that could affect elections, democratic processes, and social cohesion in various countries worldwide, as well as sentiment contradicting the “consensus” narrative about climate change.

Echoing these same concerns, the United Nations (UN),its strategic partnerin advancing the climate-focused2030 Agendafor Sustainable Development,has previously statedmuch of the same.

InInformation Integrity on Digital Platforms, a June 2023 UN policy brief recommending a code of conduct for digital platforms, Secretary-General António Guterres stated:

The ability to dissem­inate large-scale disinformation to undermine scientifically established facts poses an exis­tential risk to humanity (A/75/982, para. 26) and endangers democratic institutions and funda­mental human rights. These risks have further in­tensified because of rapid advancements in tech­nology, such as generative artificial intelligence. Across the world, the United Nations is monitor­ing how mis- and disinformation and hate speech can threaten progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. It has become clear that business as usual is not an option.”

All the UN’s 2030 Agenda plans, activities, and expenditures are based on the belief that we face an existential climate crisis caused by human activity and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This conviction is clearly outlined ina fact sheetproduced byVerified, a joint initiative of the United Nations andPurpose, launched in 2020 to respond to mis- and disinformation about “intersecting crises like COVID-19 and climate change.” The document states unequivocally that:

Climate change is happening.

Climate change is caused by human activity.

Scientists agree that humans are responsible for climate change.

Every fraction of a degree of warming matters.

The climate is changing faster than humans, plants, and animals can adapt.

Climate change is a major threat to people’s health.

Natural gas is a fossil fuel, not a clean source of energy.

Clean energy technologies produce far less carbon pollution than fossil fuels.

Entire countries already rely 100 percent on renewable electricity.

Renewable energy will soon be the world’s top source of electricity.

Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels.

Solar panels and wind turbines make good use of land.

The transition to clean energy will create millions of jobs.

By stating that disinformation is undermining these supposed scientific facts, Guterres rests his entire argument on the premise that each of the above statements is absolutely, indisputably, and undeniably true.Like Guterres, all who espouse this climate narrative have no tolerance for any opinion, theory, or evidence that runs contrary to this dogged notion.

Verified is backed by powerful globalist NGOs including the Rockefeller Foundation and Omidyar Network. It has an extensivelist of major media collaboratorssuch as Al Jazeera, Clear Channel, Facebook, Reddit, Spotify, TikTok, and Twitter. Melissa Fleming, Verified co-founder and current UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, has made it known thatsocial media is a huge threatto climate science and other UN initiatives and is particularlybothered by Twitter/Xfor allowing rampant disinformation.

It is clear from these reports that any dissent from the established climate narrative threatens the advancement of the UN’s 17Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs).Now, urgent calls to extinguish these threats have been issued so they can proceed with transforming the world unimpeded.

While many of the issues expressed in theInformation Integrityreport are legitimate and concerning, the UN via the World Health Organization (WHO) participates in disinformation by continuing topromote COVID-19 vaccinesassafe and effective, when they have largely been proven to beineffective and cause much harm. Their stance regarding climate change could also qualify as disinformation to thethousands of scientistswho oppose this view but are being discredited as mere conspiracy theorists.

The following statement from the report underscores their frustration with “climate deniers” and the platforms they use to oppose the UN’s agenda:

…mis- and disinformation about the cli­mate emergency are delaying urgently needed action to ensure a liveable future for the planet. Climate mis- and disinformation can be under­stood as false or misleading content thatun­dercuts the scientifically agreed basis for the existence of human-induced climate change, its causes and impacts. Coordinated campaigns are seeking to deny, minimize or distract from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific consensus and derail urgent action to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement.A small but vocal minority of climate science de­nialistscontinue to reject the consensus po­sition and command an outsized presence on some digital platforms.”(p. 12, emphasis added)

Globalists want conformity regarding climate change and will go to extreme lengths to marginalize, censor, and discredit dissenters. They talk a good game about enforcinguniversal freedom of expression, but on climate and other issues vital to their agenda, free speech is not tolerated. Though they readily acknowledge that controlling information may lead to greater levels of authoritarianism, surveillance, censorship, and the erosion of human rights, it seems they are willing to overlook these offenses to protect their precious climate agenda.

If they can successfully shut down debate about climate change, then soon any topic that threatens their aims will be off limits. The UN deems itself a protector of human rights but plays a major role in the media-censorship complex. Its attempts at crushing opposition to the climate narrative betrays their mission and reveals authoritarian tendencies.

Arecently released reportissued by theCenter for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)claims that new forms of climate denial have emerged. These new arguments don’t deny that the climate is changing and is caused by human activity, but instead contend that:

The impacts of global warming are beneficial or harmless.

Climate solutions won’t work.

Climate science and the climate movement are unreliable.

The basis for their report stems from use of “an AI based model calledCARDS,” short forComputer-Assisted Recognition of Climate Change Denial and Skepticism. CARDS is designed to identify and categorize climate denialist claims in text. The researchers used CARDS to analyze YouTube video transcripts from 96 mostly right-wing, conservative leaning channels including prominent ones like BlazeTV, Jordan Peterson, and the Heartland Institute.

CCDH has a big gripe with social media companies they believe are not doing enough to stem the tide of rising climate denial. They want to eliminate the ability for any “climate denier” spreading “conspiracy theory statements” to financially benefit from their content, as evidenced in the following statements:

To support the global efforts to avert climate disaster, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Xshould all demonetize and de-amplify New Denial content. Demonetizing climate denial removes the economic incentives underpinning its creation and protects advertisers from bankrolling harmful content. Moreover, de-amplifying climate denial limits its reach and visibility, allowing time for fact-checking and other protective measures to be applied where content is clearly contrary to the well-established scientific consensus on climate change”p. 34; emphasis added

CCDH polling on social media usage tested respondents’ agreement withconspiracy theory statements, including the statement: “Humans are not the main cause of global temperature increases.” CCDH found that 43% of adults and 56% of teenagers who report high activity on social media expressed agreement with that statement. This link between social media usage andconspiracist beliefillustrates why urgent action is needed to prioritize information integrity on digital platforms in climate policymaking”p. 34; emphasis added

Their demonetization and censorship recommendations come even after admitting that the CARDS model is onlyup to 78% accurate, couldnot perform any fact checkson the claims made in the transcripts, and that lack of punctuation causedresults to be skewed.

Image: The New Climate Denial Report, Page 40

The CCDH is asketchy, UK-based, advocacy group that has produced various reports inciting censorship against those they disagree with. Theirefforts against “anti-vaxxers”culminated in several reports that led to the deplatforming, demonetizing, and discrediting of many individuals and organizations exposing pandemic-related fraud and COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods.

CCDH’sTheNew Climate Denialreport has been promoted through mainstream outlets like CNN, MSN, Yahoo, and USA Today. It could impact the cited individuals and organizations the same way it affected those targeted in itsDisinformation Dozenreports a few years ago. Though their stated mission is to “protect human rights and civil liberties online,” they practice the opposite by advocating the revocation of these rights for climate and vaccine narrative challengers.

Two things are very clear from the recent reports issued by the WEF, UN, and CCDH. One, is that climate skepticism is on the rise. The second, is that they are threatened by the very existence of those who dare to refute their narrative. Many strategies to stem the tide of climate cynicism have already been employed with new ones currently being tested.

If one dares to publicly question the science regarding climate change, one or more of the following tactics may be used to impede the effort:

Artificial Intelligence

DemonetizationandFinancial censorship

Media and information literacy

Prebunking/psychological inoculation

Text mining / Automated text analysis

Whole-of-society approach

In addition to Verified and CCDH, other organizations utilizing these methods to silence opposers include:

2024-04-06 22:29:38,European Debt Trap Ahead!,https://web.archive.org/web/20240408112119/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-07/european-debt-trap-ahead,"Investors' attention has rightly been on the US fiscal deficit, but rising tensions between Russia and Europe suggest thatthe fiscal situations of European governments may trigger a European sovereign crisis 2.0 sooner than in the US. A flashback to February 1992 and the notoriousMaastricht Treatyis necessary. This treaty, which laid the foundation for the European Union and the euro, established four rules:

Deficit rule: A country is compliant if its general government budget balance is equal to or larger than -3% of GDP, or if any breach of the -3% threshold remains small (maximum 0.5% of GDP) and limited to one year.

Debt rule: A country is compliant if its general government debt-to-GDP ratio is below 60%, or if any excess above 60% of GDP has been decreasing by 1/20 on average over the past three years.

Structural balance rule: A country is compliant if its structural budget balance is at or above the medium-term objective (MTO), or if progress towards the MTO is sufficient (annual improvement of the structural balance equal to or greater than 0.5% of GDP, or the remaining distance to the MTO is less than 0.5% of GDP).

Expenditure rule: A country is compliant if the annual growth rate of primary government expenditure, net of discretionary revenue measures and one-offs, is at or below the 10-year average of the nominal rate of potential output growth minus the convergence margin necessary for adjusting the structural budget deficit in line with the structural balance rule.

Fast forward to 2024, France and Italy are major disasters in terms of the budget deficit rule.France currently has a budget deficit of 7%, while Italy's stands at 5%. France needs to reduce its deficit by a significant 4% of GDP. Neither Italy nor Greece should have been allowed in the EMU (European Monetary Union – Eurozone) originally. Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio sits at 170%, far surpassing the 60% target. Only the Scandinavian countries are currently in compliance.

On February 10th, away from the media spotlight as usual when it is about talking fiscal policies,the EU agreed to ""Looser Fiscal rules to cut debt, boost investments.""The revised rules permit countries with excessive borrowing to reduce their debt by an average of 1% per year if it exceeds 90% of gross domestic product (GDP), and by 0.5% per year on average if the debt is between 60% and 90% of GDP. Countries with a deficit exceeding 3% of GDP are mandated to halve it to 1.5% during periods of growth, establishing a safety buffer for anticipated challenges.Defense spending will now be factored into the Commission's assessment of a country's high deficit, a response triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Under the new rules, countries have seven years, extended from four previously, to reduce debt and deficit starting from 2025.

Fifteen or so years after the Euro area’s sovereign debt crisis, Europe faces another financial turmoil. France and Italy's high budget deficits for 2024, over 7% and 5% respectively, are warning signs. Butthese figures are symptoms of deeper economic stagnation.Germany, despite differing fiscal policies, also grapples with similar challenges. The collapse of Nicolae Ceaucescu's repressive but debt-free regime in Romania serves as a poignant reminder that the volume of debt alone does not determine sustainability. Rather, it is a state's ability to provide welfare and contentment while remaining financially stable. Politics, therefore, becomes the art of balancing these aspects continuously. Historically, the European model relied on oligopolistic industrial firms, heavily supported by favourable regulations and state-backed services. These firms, like those in the German automotive sector, enjoyed high profit margins and dominated the economy. This setup also shaped social policies, ensuring equitable distribution of benefits through fiscal transfers and labour market interventions. However,European companies now struggle to sustain profitsand fund research. While government intervention historically fostered industries, prioritizing incumbents, the new digital revolution has also changed the nature of economic growth. Withthe lack of access to ""cheap energy""since the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, theGerman business model, relying on cheap energy to manufacture goods,has been structurally broken.In a nutshell, the growthengine of the European Union is brokenand the weaker satellite likeFrance and Italy will be first in line to pay the pay priceof this new industrial reality.

Germany Industrial Production.

Zooming in,France is poised to be at the epicentre of the impending European Ice Age, as its fundamentals have been deteriorating since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. With a government spending to tax revenue ratio of 0.5, France has persistently lived beyond its means, and the looming recession is expected to worsen this situation, potentially pushing the ratio even lower than during the peak of the Covid pandemic.

France: Ratio of government spending to tax revenue.

In a ""bureaucratic communist"" country like France, where the government plays a dominant role in generating GDP, investors would be wise to focus on the ratio ofgovernment debt to the GDP generated by the private sector, representing real economic activity. At 198%, the French government's debt-to-private-sector-GDP ratio has reached levels comparable to those seen in Argentina before experiencing a collapse of their sovereign debt.

France: Ratio of government debt to GDP generated by the private sector.

This rings particularly true when considering the inflation rate for everyday people, often referred to in France as the ""Gilets Jaunes"" in reference to the 2018 social unrest sparked by working-class individuals. This inflation indexencompasses energy, food, and housing costs which are the costs that matter for the average employee. Since the onset of the Covid pandemic, the rising prices of these three basic necessities have surpassed the average wage increase for French workers. Consequently, the quality of life for the average French worker has significantly deteriorated since the pandemic's onset whatever the ambient narrative prevailing among the elites.

Average wage per capita in France (black line); ‘Gilets Jaunes’ Inflation Index (1/3 Food; 1/3 energy; 1/3 housing) (red line).

France faces the challenge of refinancing EUR273 billion in 2024, EUR262 billion in 2025, and EUR278 billion in 2026, totalling EUR813 billion of its EUR2.766 trillion debt over the next 36 months. The current weighted average coupon of the French debt is 1.61% compared to the French 10-OAT yielding at 2.9%. Given the current fiscal situation, smooth refinancing seems unlikely.

So, France, like many European countries grappling with deregulated immigration are onthe brink of a social revolution. Additionally, France is entering adire ‘debt trap’. As a matter of fact,France is in a more precarious situation than Italyin the impending sovereign debt crisis, one can examine the spread between Italian and French 10-year yields, which is atits lowest level since 2015. This suggests that Macron may have recognized the need to divert financial markets' attention from the dire state of the French economy by adopting a more aggressive stance among NATO leaders. Historically, wars have often been a catalyst for governments to default on their debt.

Spread between Italy and France 10-Year Yield.

Currently, thefinancial markets are not pricing in the risk of a sovereign debt crisisin France or Italy, evident from near-decade-low CDS spreads. However, a reassessment of ""European government risk"" would likely triggercapital outflowsfrom the region andsignificantly weaken the EUR/USD forex rate.

France CDS (blue line); Italy CDS (green line); Spain CDS (purple line) & EUR/USD FX rate (axis inverted; red line).

On March 21st, the European Council President urged Europe to transition to a war economy, emphasizing job creation as a significant benefit. Charles Michel's endorsement reflectsEurope's extensive history of conflict, with the Russia/Ukraine NATO war being just one of many, marking the 487th military conflict in Europe over the past 2000 years. Europe's increasing reliance on China and the US for security, coupled with its dependency on Russia for energy, suggests thatcapital outflows are likely to intensify in the coming monthsas geopolitical tensions escalate on the ground. Consequently,Europe may be tempted to impose capital controls, as most Emerging Markets have done during previous financial crises.

Rates ALWAYS rise during warbecause governments print money like never before, and inflation skyrockets, forcing them toput capital controls, wage controls, price controls, and rationing in place.This time will not be different, andEurope is moving first in this direction.

In this context, given the Eurozone's bureaucratic tendencies, it's no surprise that it has beguntightening regulations on cryptocurrency. This move primarily targets private wallets, aligning with theECB's preparations to launch a CBDC. This initiative likely formspart of the European Union's strategy to increase taxes for financing defense efforts and to implement capital controlsmore efficiently than emerging markets have done in the past. The ECB's presentation from March 2024 outlines a timetable for the Digital Euro, with development and implementation set to begin in November 2025 after the legislative process is completed. This aligns with the EU's plan to issue digital identity cards to all residents by 2030 for government identification and citizen tracking.

From an investment perspective,it's impossible for this catastrophe to have no repercussions for various economic actors. However, as always, these effects will take time to manifest.Insurance companies, for instance, guarantee future risks and maintain reserves to cover them, typically invested in government bonds, real estate, and minimally in stocks. With real estate also declining due to rising interest rates, they've incurred a 40% loss on these reserves. Meanwhile, the costs of the risks they've insured have risen due to inflation, prompting them to significantly increase prices. This willreduce the profitability of insured businesses and lower individuals' standards of living, exacerbating the impending recession.Commercial banks, much like insurance companies, have their mandatory reservesheavily invested in government bonds. With these bonds declining, along with their capacity to absorb defaults, banks are likely to halt lending. Already, there's a virtual freeze on new loans, particularly in real estate.Pension funds, which cater to complementary pensions,typically allocate about 50% of their reserves to various investments.

Investors should not be swayed by the prevailing narrative suggesting that all is well for the European banking system, as indicated by the current state of CDS. Instead, it's crucial to recognize that the banking system, especially in France, is poised to endure substantial losses from the impending sovereign debt crisis in the region.

Taking a closer look behind the curtain, at loans provided by Monetary Financial Institutions (MFIs) to Euro area financial corporations other than MFIs and ICPFs (Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds), which essentially encompassloans made by Euro area banks to non-banks, including investment funds and securitization structures, reveals an intriguing trend. While there has been an overall decrease in loans across the European banking system in recent years,this specific category of loans tends to rise during periods of heightened liquidity and economic financial circumstances.

Recent history provides ample evidence of this phenomenon. For instance,in early 2007, as the world began to grapple with the unfolding subprime mortgage crisis, there was a notable increase in loans provided by Euro area banks to non-bank financial corporations. Similarly,asimilar trend was observed in December 2009, preceding the onset of the Greek debt crisis.

Indeed, history repeats itself, and we witnessedsimilar events once again in January 2018, when dollar funding became scarce, leading to liquidity issues worldwide.This trend resurfaced in February 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting disruptions to energy supplies, which impacted the European economy. Therefore, the increase in loans from European banks to non-banks serves asa reliable canary in the coal mine, signalling the loomingpossibility of a credit event brewing behind the scene.

To provide context,the current value of loans from European banks to non-banks stands at EUR 1.3 trillion, a significant sum within the global banking sector. This represents a5.7% increase since August 2023. Conversely, loans from banks to households have either remained stagnant or decreased, reflecting tightened liquidity and a pessimistic economic environment.

This trend serves asa warning sign that a crisis may be looming beneath the surface in Europe. While the exact reason for the increase in loans to non-banks is not definitively known, clues suggesta potential connection to the commercial real estate problem in Europe. The latest Financial Stability Review from the ECB has highlighted this issue, indicating that it may be contributing to the uptick in loans to non-banks.

In its 2023 annual report released two weeks ago,UBS highlighted the downturn in commercial real estate as one of its ""top and emerging risks.""This concern arises from high interest rates and a decline in demand for office space, impacting the sector. UBS expressed apprehension about adverse effects on valuations due to higher interest rates and the structural decline in demand for office and retail space. The bank emphasizedthe potential broader impacts stemming from material balance sheet exposure to the sector by both bank and non-bank lenders. The bank defines ""top and emerging risks"" as those with the potential to materialize within one year and significantly affect the group. Other risks highlighted in the report includeinflationandgeopolitics. Notably,commercial real estate did not feature among its top risks in the previous annual report.

Lagarde has already been quite clear that the first interest rate reduction will come in June, as she mentioned at the latest ECB meeting on March 20th. This view has been widelyendorsed by many members of the Governing Council, including the most hawkish among them.

With stagflation already present and the banking system facing uncertainty, it's unsurprising that theECB has adopted a more dovish stance compared to the ‘politically correct’ FED. Given the ECB's heightened political sensitivity compared to the FED, it's anticipated that theECB will be compelled to cut rates ahead of the June European electionto lure electors to support the war agenda of current heads of states and to avoid dealing with rising nationalist parties. This prospect is likely to serve asanother catalyst for the EUR to weaken against the USD in the months ahead.

2024-04-06 23:20:00,America Is Hurtling Toward A Full-Blown Hot Civil War,https://web.archive.org/web/20240407121010/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/america-hurtling-toward-full-blown-hot-civil-war#comment-stream,"Authored by Justin Smith via The Burning Platform blog,

It never ceases to amaze me at how little so many people in this country have done to train their minds to critically analyze information.They have eyes to see and ears to see, and yet, somehow the truth of any major issue still seems to evade them, or they simply refuse to recognize the truth with it standing right in front of them, slapping them in the face.

So many things are currently plumb damned fouled up by this Biden regime and going awry on their own through the dynamicsset in motion by this anti-American, lawless regime, that it’s nearly impossible to properly address them all in a single commentary. But I’ve tried to give the Reader as comprehensive an assessment as I possibly can with this piece.

Michael Savage, a longtime renown radio host, was fond of noting that“liberalism is a mental disorder” and we’re witnessing the result of its heavy utilization for far too many years without being grounded in common sense and a certain amount of pragmatic realism.And so here we are, on the cusp of the final fall of America, short of a miracle from God or true patriots taking a firm stand with rifles in hand and refusing to give an inch of ground and any further movement towards the new world order desired by our amerikkan commies.

It might sound quaint and out of touch with what some have now accepted as “the new normal”, but I say we should all wrap ourselves in the American Flag and send out the clarion call for a rush of strong, capable men to come to the aid of their country, in a manner as never before.

“I may be crazy. But it’s no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” ~ Ivor Browne, Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the University College Dublin [2017]

In an ideal and perfect world, all Americans would be following a righteously guided conscience and their better angels, and they could trust that their elected leaders were doing likewise; but, we live in a far from perfect world or society, and the fools of the country have abandoned Christian kindness, the Golden Rule and humanity for the evil of trans-humanism.Heartwarming words advocating for true freedom and liberty are far and few between in today’s society and political arenas, in a manner not too unlike the years between 1850 and 1860 that led to the Civil War; and tho’ some on both side of the political aisle still exude goodness in a way that makes each day seem a bit brighter, by and large, the Democratic Party has been completely infiltrated by Marxist-Maoist Communists, who are driving the nation towards the darkest tyranny and bloodiest days ever witnessed in America, as they attempt to stamp out the tenderness and beauty in each person’s soul and reduce us all to mere mindless cogs in their authoritarian machine.

Look around.Half or more of America’s citizenry have lost their minds and are six steps or more removed from reality,either due to the mind-numbing communist indoctrination they have absorbed from their “education” in the public school system, something genetic or a trauma from their life, some new maniacal drug that has them hooked and out of their minds, or a combination of all three.

Some would suggest that we set about immediately reforming public education to promote and defend the ideas that originally built America, but we don’t have time to change hearts and minds to counter a movement that started over a hundred years ago and now sits on the cusp of being able to solidify its current stranglehold on America, if the tide swings its way in the 2024 Election or they are able to steal the election through current fraud facilitating mechanisms. Although we can still move to properly educate the next generation in a newly reformed education system or through homeschool, now is the time to organize and assemble those within the country who already know and hold to the truth of American principles and all the freedom and liberty that follow — time to gather our like-minded American patriots and those Lions of Liberty who have had enough of witnessing this America we love so well so sorely abused, put upon and assaulted.

It doesn’t help when we have self-serving, corrupt people in high office promising to save the gullible and ill-informed from their hell and the misery it brings, if only they will support more madness to be placed in U.S. code. Vote for more economy killing “climate change” change regulations and initiatives and “we’ll put more money on your EBT cards, courtesy of Uncle Sam and the American taxpayer”. “Help us make sure the government has the final say over everybody’s children and can kill babies as they exit the birthing canal, and we’ll make certain you get privilege over all other Americans”, one can almost hear Traitor Joe whispering in some dimly lit concert hall. “You can be a champion among champions”, they say — “Let us help you change your gender”.

And if anyone stands in your way in the pursuit of any evil, it is they who will be called evil and fallen upon by the full weight of the U.S. Federal Government.

Oh yea. And as if that isn’t bad enough, Biden is now moving as fast as he can to forgive $144 billion more in student loans. He plans to announce this on Monday, April 8th 2024, and for anyone with eyes to see, this is simply corruption at its worst and Biden buying votes in the upcoming presidential election. What a slap in the face of Americans who couldn’t afford to go to college but now will be forced to bear the tax burden this move will bring.

I see the immorality growing every day, the people who revel in its evil, freaks from some futuristic sideshow that bodes ill and speaks to the destruction of humanity. and with each passing day, I find myself moving farther and farther away from those with whom I have little or nothing in common with, adrift from most of humanity too. Not in any manner that lends itself to any sadness over my situation, but rather as if to say “whew” in a realization of the relief that has come by way of my separation from those I despise most.

It’s sort of like I’m standing on the river bank watching the “ship of fools” sailing over the river falls in denial of their own mortality, thinking their crazy ideas will save them and hold them invincible, or worse, knowing they are going to die and not caring who they drag to Hell along with them.They think we’re crazy for defending America’s righteous and true founding principles and virtues and the liberty associated with them, and we think them mad for denying God, reality and the best mankind has to offer in exchange for an evil, unrestrained, immoral freedom that is no freedom at all, a bringer of Death.

Since 1965, the communists within the federal government, Congress and many state and local governments have essentially separated us and pitted us against one another as one aggrieved group or another, some special interest and through identity politics and racial hatred. They broke us into tribes and acted as if the represented each, all the while setting in place mechanisms that made us serfs to the government, The Leviathan, and reducing us all to poverty as they have gradually destroyed the bulk of the middle class in our country. The Constitution is so degraded and eroded now that any tyrant can impose his will by way of one flourish of a pen, which Traitor Joe has done through 118 executive orders, bypassing Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court.

We have a national debt that’s rapidly approaching $35 trillion and counting, that to be sure rests on the shoulders of both parties, but itcouldn’t have arrived to this abysmal point without both Marxist-Maoists and RINOs accepting the tenets of the Marxist-Keynesian Modern Monetary Theory and the notion that any one nation could print and borrow an endless supply of money forever without any terrible consequence, which is currently being proven wrong.Our people struggle to pay for food and rent and new high mortgage rates have put home ownership out of reach for this new Generation Z that is coming up and expecting a successful way of life to be attainable in some form or fashion, even tho’ many of them are a great part of the problem, some thirty percent claiming to be either queer themselves or supportive of the LGBTQ sickness running rampant through American society, advocating for every known sexual perversion and deviancy one might care to mention.

Several decades ago, I realized every government in the world was using a Keynesian debt-based system, printing money as if there was no end to real assets or backing for it.Basically, the world had gone mad, as the greed of its so-called “leaders” knew no bounds, and the various governments of the world basically accepted the use of monopoly money.The charade is ongoing and the casino open, that is, ’til those at the very top decide to call in their markers and usher in the final forced phase of The Great Reset.

In 2008, as I watched the near total collapse of our economic system and heard George [Bush] say that we had to temporarily abandon the free market capitalist system in order to save it, I received a strong sense that America may have peaked and was as good as it was going to get from there on out. I had a feeling that things were only going to continue to decline, especially as one major corporation after the next receive a taxpayer funded bailout after being deemed “too big to fail”.

In unbelievable fashion, when the largest economic collapse in U.S. history hit in March 2020, to be followed by the Covid Lockdowns, pushed and kept going for years by traitors to America, such as Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, many of us saw it for the fraud it was. Still, whole swaths of our cultural freedoms and norms were very nearly destroyed, as a timid American people complied, by and large, because they couldn’t simply stand on their hind feet and tell the government despots “NO”. Even now, as many careers no longer exist and jobs are disappearing like cotton-candy on a rainy day, far too many, especially the communists among us, hold to the delusion that all is well and deny that out-of-control spending and massive national debt really do matter for the health of the nation’s economy.

Who could have possibly known at the time — other than those Deep State bad actors behind the curtain — that this was a dire harbinger of things to come and but one of the first precursors to a validation of this current system of economic fascism as the preeminent and defining feature of what everyone still mistakenly calls our “free market capitalist system”.Who knew that — if one believes Obama and now Biden — the cure for debt was more debt; the cure for greed was more greed, and that envy of the neighbors’ possessions was perfectly acceptable, even if one easily walked on over to take them by force, through armed robbery. And who could have foreseen that every Marxist-Maoist of the Democratic Party would become modern day Jezebels, condemning the innocent by way of one false accusation after another, paving the way for a vile new phenomena and way of life for the misguided youth of America.

But never in my wildest imagination did I expect to see every single government institution corrupted to its very core and heavily infiltrated by men and women seeking to destroy traditional America — to “transform America” — and bring great harm to all Americans in the process, as evil was called “good” and good was called “evil”, turning the world upside down as foretold in Isaiah 5:20, as we all witnessed in 2020, driven by the Democratic Party Communists and fascists and globalists of the country, for the most part. Never did I expect to see U.S. science so corrupted and in denial of real science, reality itself, as supposedly “educated” people were soon trying to convince the entire nation that men could really become women and women could become men — that men actually have periods and can have babies.

And asthe American people continue to fail to mount a strong and passionate rejection or effective defense against the current climate change directives from the Biden regime,the Biden regime has just recently [January 26th] ordered our international export of natural gas and natural gas extraction to be placed on hold; and it’s still on hold as of this writing [April 5th], while its impact on the environment is further scrutinized. And in the meantime, the movement towards greater control over our society by way of a digital currency is gaining momentum.

I don’t think the Biden regime is going to be able to control much of anything once they completely destroy America’s energy infrastructure and our efficacy as an worldwide energy powerhouse, as we were under the Trump administration. It’s going to be damned difficult to control anything without electricity, fossil fuels or heat, and all hell will be unleashed once Americans start being forced to sit in the dark, shivering in the cold or sweltering in the heat.

When I hear Rachel “Mad-Cow” Maddow and Chris “Cry-baby” Matthews talking about Republicans who support Trump being members of a cult with “crazy ideas”, I think how ironic, that they are perfectly describing themselves and their ilk.They are so insane that they don’t even recognize themselves in that description or what it is that they don’t know; they call themselves “the normal people” as their despot leader, Traitor Joe, dismantles and tears the American republic down around the shoulders of all Americans.

In listening to many proponents of the Democratic Party Communist platform and agenda — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer for three in particular — I cannot help but wonder when did the wards for the mentally ill release all the inmates. And so here we are in America, where the inmates of mental institutions, federal prisons, Illegal Aliens, drug dealers and sexual deviants and child predators are running the country and the Oval Office today.

I have noted in several past articles, I do believe the “united States” is currently hurling down a path on a fast track to a full blown, hot civil war.What will emerge will either be a nation squashed under an iron-fisted communist government or a people united in freedom and liberty under a limited government, restrained from ever growing or overreaching as the current Federal System has allowed and the Biden regime has done, trampling on the entire Constitution and our Inalienable God-given Rights in the process.

Although I refuse to accept any excuse for the far-reaching, incredible and massive ignorance of so many of my countrymen in this day of the internet and information, with books aplenty in every public library too, there are an unbelievable number who accumulate scores, even hundreds, of bits and pieces of the bigger picture without the ability or the will to put them together to reach any worthwhile conclusion aimed at formulating a proper course of action to resist this current totalitarian-minded movement and save themselves, their families and communities and America herself. They do not currently seem to have any real sense of urgency, unless one looks at leadership in Texas and Florida and the current manufactured border crisis.

Twenty-five state governors stood alongside Governor Abbot of Texas in the border dispute with the Biden regime,and the Governor of South Carolina sent his own National Guardsmen to the border to assist the Texas National Guard and Texas’s various law enforcement agencies who are in this struggle for America’s survival. So although I was speaking of the average citizen in the preceding paragraph, there are some holding key positions who see the rapidly approaching existential threats to all America and are reacting with a high level of urgency and accordingly, using everything within their power to stop this one segment of the madness emanating from the Biden regime.

America has been cleaved into two separate and antithetical ideologies — two opposing worldviews — with the communists and radical takers of the country supporting a dark vision of tyranny and the conservatives and independent producers supporting the light of truth and a vision of freedom and liberty. They are both hanging in the balance and waiting for gravity or some monumental event to throw the lever that moves them to act and take the country by storm, with the Democrats willing to use every illegal means imaginable.

The heavy infiltration of Illegal Aliens from many foreign countries that are unfriendly or outright enemies of America is one more dynamic and issue of concern for all who love America, since they will certainly come down on the side which is trying to destroy America.No one should be oblivious to the fact that various “sleeper cells” of Hamas and Hezbollah have been in America for several decades now.Taken in conjunction with thousands of military aged Chinese men entering the country illegally the coming chaos will be Biblical in proportion to anything we have witnessed in all American history.

Nineteenth century French economist and writer, Frederic Bastiat could have been speaking of America today and the situation She currently finds Herself, as he once stated:

“When misguided public opinion honors what is despicable and despises what is honorable, punishes virtue and rewards vice, encourages what is harmful and discourages what is useful, applauds falsehood and smothers truth under indifference or insult, a nation turns its back on progress and can be restored only by the terrible lessons of catastrophe.”

Americans from all across the country have either beencomplicit in this current treason to “fundamentally transform America”, into something strange and foreign to the Founding, or they have simply been so complacent as to allow the country to fall to her enemies-from-within, in a manner that’s proving fairly damned tough to counter for the moment due to a litany of reasons, from lawfare against conservative and independent patriots to the outright targeting of American patriots by the FBI and the DOJ. But basically, the nation is just about to reap the full, terrible consequences of what was sown so many decades ago, and everyone had better prepare as best as they can.

We can’t stop what is headed down the road towards us, no matter if we stopped all unnecessary spending or the invasion at the border today — not if we outlawed all deviancy, abuse of children through gender assignment and men competing in women’s sports, or started drilling for oil and gas like crazy overnight.The die has been cast, and no one single man or woman, sitting in the Oval Office, can change what is coming, not Trump or RFK, JR or anyone else who wants to give it a try.

All good and decent Americans, who can still remember what America used to be or who have been well taught from childhood and know what a great nation — an exceptional nation — She has been in years gone by, will soon be forced to fight against enemies-from-within and foreign enemies supported by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations, so that our friends, families and communities can survive this period and freedom and liberty shall not perish in our land. And as we fight, we must pray and hope that our side emerges victoriously from the din and cacophony of the conflagration and chaos, in order that we may purge the land of those who hate America and restore Her to a land that truly understands what “equality under the law” actually means, to be governed in a manner that actually defends and protects the Inalienable God-given Rights for all, restoring America as something better than She has been in a long, long time.

This is the war that lays ahead of us, looming just over the horizon, and our very lives and the lives of our loved ones depend on our success. The death of America as She has stood is guaranteed, unless liberty-minded patriots rise from the ashes of the next civil war. That is the reality and the future we now must face.

Keep ringing the bell … the Liberty Bell and the sound of Freedom from sea to shining sea.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan signed a decree on April 4 to suspend Ankara's duties under the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.

In November last year, Washington and NATO members withdrew from the European arms-limiting pact after Russia made the same move.

""The CFE Treaty was concluded at the end of the Cold War, when the formation of a new architecture of global and European security based on cooperation seemed possible, and appropriate attempts were made,"" Russia's foreign ministrysaid, adding, ""Even the formal preservation of the CFE Treaty has become unacceptable from the point of view of Russia’s fundamental security interests.""

The move by Ankara signalswarming ties between Turkiye and the USbefore a planned meeting between Erdogan and US President Joe Biden in Washington next month.

Diplomacy between the US and Turkey has improved significantly since Ankara approved Sweden's NATO entry, ending a more than20-monthwait period. This move by Turkey also saw the US sign off on a $23 billion sale of F-16 warplanes, missiles, and bombs.

""I think this is a moment of significant momentum for the U.S.-Turkey partnership,"" U.S. SenatorChris Murphysaid in February during a trip to Turkey following Sweden’s acceptance.

However,some NATO allies remain divided over issues including Turkey’s purchase of advanced Russian missile defense systems, as well as the US support for the Kurdish People's Defense Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), both of whom Turkiye considers terrorist organizations.

Several members of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)have even said that they will be increasing their numbers of conscripted soldiers, the latest of which were Denmark (announced 13 March, 2024) and Norway (announced Tuesday).

But what are the sentiments of people living in NATO states on the topic?

As Statista's Anna Fleck shows in the chart below,data from a NATOsurveyshows thatwhile support is high when it comes to the question of relying on allies to come to their country’s aid, respondents were less sure of helping others to defend themselves...

You will find more infographics atStatista

For example, where70 percent of respondents in the United Stateswere of the opinion that thecountry should be defended by its alliesin the event of an attack,60 percentsaid that they thought that thecountry should answer the call of their allies.

Out of the member states selected for this chart,a lack of solidarity is particularly evident in southeastern Europe.

In Greece, Hungary, Bulgaria and Montenegro, less than half of those surveyed agree that their home country should defend others, while 58 to 71 percent of survey participants want to be protected. Iceland has the biggest gap between the two questions: 78 percent think NATO should defend the island state, while only 47 percent support their backing of others. In the survey, Norwegians showed the strongest leaning towards solidarity.

2024-04-07 08:10:00,Swiss To Hold Referendum That Will Restrict Population To 10 Million Until 2050,https://web.archive.org/web/20240407121010/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/swiss-hold-referendum-will-restrict-population-10-million-until-2050,"Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Modernity.news,

In a move intended to restrict mass migration, Switzerland will hold a referendum to restrict their population to 10 million until 2050.

The vote will take place after the populist Swiss People’s Party (UDC) harvested 114,600 signatures in just nine months, meeting a government requirement for 100,000 signatures within 18 months for the referendum to go ahead.

If approved, the referendum will ensure Switzerland maintains “sustainable demographic development” by restricting the permanent resident population of the wealthy European country to 10 million for the next 25 years.

“Under the proposal, the Swiss government would have to take urgent measures as soon as the permanent resident population exceeds 9.5 million by, for example, suspending the ability for migrants to obtain residence permits, Swiss citizenship, or any other right to stay in the country,” reportsRemix News.

The vote would also likely mean Switzerland would be forced to end its bilateral agreement with the European Union on free movement and pull out of the U.N. Global Compact for Migration.

A petition to restrict immigration by any means necessary garnered the 100,000 signatures required to force the government to hold a referendum.https://t.co/GAafOMLbAZ

UDC leader Marco Chiesa said the referendum would guarantee “the safety, services, and well-being of all of us” while serving “to preserve our values: independence, direct democracy, sovereignty, and freedom.”

“Since 2023, for the first time, more than 9 million people have been living in our country,”said UDC National Councilor and Group Chairman Thomas Aeschi.

“Last year, an additional 98,851 people immigrated to our country. Added to this are more than 30,000 asylum seekers.”

As in other European countries, mass migration to Switzerland has resulted in “housing shortages and rising rents, traffic jams on the roads, crowded trains and buses, falling standards of schools, increasing violence and crime, electricity shortages, income stagnating per capita, ever-higher health insurance premiums, indebted social services, and increased pressure on the beauty of the landscape and the preservation of nature,” according to the party.

The UDC previously warned that the country was being subsumed by mass migration, with new arrivals from Africa having welfare rates of 34 per cent.

Around two-thirds of prison inmates in Switzerland areforeign nationals, with Algerians representing the highest proportion.

Meanwhile, as we document in the video below, Japan appears to have chosen a very different course, opening up its borders to mass migration to solve a labor shortage.

Over the last two weeks I have written two articles that basically arrive at the same conclusion: that I apparently have little to no idea how markets work at all, where liquidity comes from, and an uncanny ability to not predict how, when or where market crashes will occur.

2024-04-07 18:40:00,Russia Finally Says 'Nyet' To Continued North Korea Sanctions Enforcement,https://web.archive.org/web/20240408112119/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/russia-finally-says-nyet-continued-north-korea-sanctions-enforcement,"Authored by Joseph D. Terwilliger via AntiWar.com,

Last week, a United Nations Security Council resolution to extend the mandate for the UN Panel of Experts on DPRK sanctions wasvetoed by the Russian Federation, effectively disbanding the primary enforcement mechanism for thenine rounds of sanctionsthat have been imposed on the DPRK since 2006, in response to their repeated nuclear and ICBM tests.

On October 9th, 2006, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) conducted their first successfultest of a nuclear weapon. In response to this, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed resolution1718, condemning the DPRK for the test, and imposing a harsh regime of sanctions on the regime. Subsequent to a second test on May 25, 2009, they unanimously passed resolution1874, which tightened the sanctions regime significantly and established a “Panel of Experts” to “gather, examine and analyze information…regarding the implementation of the measures imposed”, for an initial period of one year. As more and more sanctions resolutions were passed in response to further nuclear and ICBM tests, the mandate for this Panel of Expertswasunanimously extendedeach year until last week.

Leading up to the vote, China and Russia had proposed a compromise to extend the mandate of the Panel of Experts for one year, conditional on adding a sunset clause to the sanctions regime, as the Chinese delegate said “Sanctions should not be set in stone or be indefinite”.The Russian delegate argued that the situation in Korea had changed enormously since 2006, and that continuing the sanctions in the name of preventing the DPRK from becoming a nuclear power was“losing its relevance” and was “detached from reality”.

It is rather ironic that the United States and its allies have been criticizing the Russia veto of an otherwise unanimous Security Council resolution as destabilizing, given that the US routinely uses its own veto power,as most followers of this site are well aware. This Russian application of its veto power has been described as a crisis for the “broader functioning of the UN Security Council and the post World War II international order”, even though it is completely obvious that we would have used our veto against any Russian or Chinese resolution to relax or discontinue the sanctions regime.

The sanctions imposed on the DPRKobviously did not have the desired effectof deterring them frombecoming a nuclear power. It is fair to ask why they failed to achieve the desired outcome, and whether continuing sanctions are likely to alter that reality.  WhenI accompanied retired NBA superstar Dennis Rodman to North Korea, Kim Jong Unpersonally explained his logic to us.He remarked that Libyan leader Moammar Qaddafi had given up his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programsin 2003, in exchange forsanctions relief and security guaranteesthat weren’t worth the paper they were written on.  As soon as the opportunity presented itself, in Spring 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton joyfully bragged thatwe had killed Qaddafi.

Furthermore, Saddam Hussein had allowed weapons inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency into his country, and theyfailed to find evidence of WMD programs (as there were none),and yet despite this, the US launched a war of regime change in 2003, which subsequentlyled to the death of Saddam Hussein.  He concluded his argument by pointing out the fact that althoughPakistan harbored America’s number one enemy, Osama bin Laden, the US never attempted a war of regime change there.  In his mind the main difference was obvious – Pakistan wasa nuclear power.

Given that the United States government has never been subtle about its desire forregime changein North Korea, and has refused to takefirst use of nuclear weapons by the United Statesoff the table in the event of war with the DPRK, Kim Jong Un’s rationale is quite compelling.  I certainly had no counterargument.

One must remember that thenumber one goal for the North Korean regime is their own survival, and Kim Jong Un’s strategic decisions (like those of any other political leader) should be evaluated in that context – obviously his priority is to stay alive and keep his job!  With that in mind, the continued pursuit of a nuclear deterrent seems like themost rationaloption.  Of course he wants a better life for his people, and relief from economic sanctions, but not at the cost of risking the regime’s collapse.

It is important to clarify that long before the DPRK developed its nuclear program, the US had already nuclearized the peninsula.  Although Paragraph 13 (d) of theKorean War Armistice Agreementforbade the introduction of any new weapons into Korea, in 1958,the Eisenhower administration deployed nuclear weapons to South Korea, in clear violation of this agreement.

This was not an isolated incident either, as the US has a long history of breaking negotiated deals with rival nations.  In 1994, Bill Clinton negotiated the “Agreed Framework” in which the DPRK would shut down their graphite-moderated nuclear reactors, to be replaced with light water reactors (LWRs) to be provided by the US, with supplies of heavy oil being provided to them to provide energy in the interim.  George W. Bush thenslow-walked providing the LWRs and stopped the shipments of fuel oil, leading the DPRK to restart the reactors to supply energy to their people.

Bush then made the aforementioned WMD deal with Qaddafi, which theObama administration failed to honor.  Obama then negotiated theJCPOAdeal with Iran, whichTrump backed out of.  Trump thenopened dialogue with the DPRK, but theBiden administration quickly returnedto “strategic patience” (i.e. giving them the silent treatment).

No wonder they feel the need for a nuclear deterrent when our policy changes so dramatically every four years,making any negotiations effectively pointless. As Kim Jong Un told us, the DPRK policy is always consistent, but the US changes all the time, adding that if they don’t like what is happening, they just wait four years. Afterwe brought a team of NBA players to Pyongyang in 2014, he further remarked that in doing so, we were the first Americans who ever kept their word.No wonder they don’t trust any security guarantees the US has offered them.

Sanctions have been referred to as war by other means (with apologies toClausewitz), and the US now has sanctions in place againstmore than 20 countriesacross Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America. The most comprehensive sanctions are currently imposed against Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela, with sanctions againstChina growingat an alarming rate. At the same time, the Chinese Yuan is being used increasingly for international trade instead of the US dollaras a result of sanctionsprohibiting many countries from using the US financial system.

North Korea says it test-fired new solid-fuel hypersonic missile.North Korea's Kim Jong Un oversaw the launch, state media says, hailing the ""important military strategic value"" of the new weaponhttps://t.co/DWjQp1JuLjpic.twitter.com/xQk3fTy5My

The height of the sanctions absurdity was best illustrated when the DPRK was alleged to havesold ammunition to Russiain early 2024.  In response to this allegation,the US complained to Russia that they were violating sanctions against the DPRK, and the US complained to the DPRK that they were violating sanctions against Russia.Does the United States expect other countries to just starve to death under sanctions regimes because we said so?

Is it perhaps more rational to imagine that our overuse of economic sanctions will inevitably create trading blocs and alliances among the countries subjected to them? Iran, Russia, China, and the DPRK have plenty of reasons to dislike one another.China and Russiahave had a complex hostile relationship for centuries, with Chairman Mao seeking a better relationship with the US partially because hefeared a Soviet invasion. Both China and Russia repeatedlyvoted in favorof all the sanctions imposed on the DPRK since 2006, because they did not want a nuclear North Korea in their backyard.Iran and Russiahave a long history of tensions, as doIran and China. AndIran and DPRKhave only worked together in a partnership of convenience for the last 35 years because of their shared status as pariahs in the eyes of the USA.

Despite the historical tensions between Iran, Russia, China, and DPRK, the sanctions regime has forced these countries into analliance and trading bloc of convenience, and the US has nobody to blame but themselves.  It should surprise nobody that China and Russia want to get the UN out of the DPRK sanctions business. That Russia finallyvetoed the continuing mandatefor the Panel of Experts should come as no surprise – the only surprise is that it took them 18 years to get there.

2024-04-07 19:50:00,Appeals Court Vacates 'Disinformation' Monitoring Of Jan. 6 Defendant’s Computer,https://web.archive.org/web/20240408112119/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/appeals-court-vacates-disinformation-monitoring-jan-6-defendants-computer,"Authored by Joseph M. Hanneman via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

A sentencing requirement that Jan. 6 defendant Daniel Goodwyn have his computer monitored by the government for “disinformation” has been vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

The court on March 26 published amandatesending the case back to U.S. District Judge Reggie Waltonto remove the computer monitoring requirementhe issued as part of thesentencing judgmentin the case on June 15, 2023.

“Judge Walton had no legal basis to issue the special condition,” Carolyn Stewart, Mr. Goodwyn’s attorney, told The Epoch Times in an April 3 email.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the judge “plainly erred” in imposing the computer monitoring. Judges Gregory Katsas, Naomi Rao, and Bradley Garcia issued a per curiam order vacating the monitoring provision.

Judge Walton, when imposing a 60-day jail sentence in June 2023, said Mr. Goodwyn spread “disinformation” during a broadcast of “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on March 14, 2023. Judge Walton ordered that Mr. Goodwyn’s computer be subject to “monitoring and inspection” by a probation agent to check if he spread Jan. 6 disinformation during the term of his supervised release.

The judge also referred to Mr. Goodwyn spreading alleged “misinformation,” using the term interchangeably with “disinformation.”

Mr. Goodwyn, 35, of Corinth, Texas, pleaded guilty on Jan. 31, 2023, to one misdemeanor count of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds without lawful authority. The charge could have meant up to a year in prison.

On June 6, 2023, Judge Walton sentenced Mr. Goodwyn to 60 days in prison, a year of supervised release, a $2,500 fine, and a $500 restitution payment.

Federal prosecutors had asked for 90 days in jail, 36 months of supervised release, a $25,676 fine, and $500 in restitution.The recommended fine amount represented proceeds of aGiveSendGoweb page Mr. Goodwyn uses to raise funds for his legal fees.

Mr. Goodwyn asked for a sentence of time served with three months of supervised release. He received credit for three weeks he spent in pretrial detention, but not for the 13 months he spent in home detention. He completed his incarceration at the Federal Correctional Institution at Bastrop, Texas, on Aug. 25, 2023.

Mr. Goodwyn said the Court of Appeals made the correct decision.

“Judge Walton’s imposition of the computer monitoring restriction is inconsistent with American law and tradition,” Mr. Goodwyn told The Epoch Times. “It’s unbelievable, in my opinion, that he would unlawfully order feds to spy on me in direct violation of the First and Fourth Amendments, under threat of locking me back up in prison.”

Mr. Goodwyn was arrested on Jan. 29, 2021, in Sherman, Texas.He was charged in asuperseding indictmenton Nov. 10, 2021, with obstruction of an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.

Mr. Goodwyn said he was at the Capitol on Jan. 6 as a citizen journalist for StopHate.com. He entered the building through the Senate Wing Door at 3:32 p.m. and spent 36 seconds inside the Capitol, security video shows.

Prosecutors and the judge faulted Mr. Goodwyn for using a bullhorn on Jan. 6 “to incite other rioters to go into the Capitol,”and saying “we need critical mass for this to work.” They said Mr. Goodwyn evaded a police officer’s attempt to stop him from entering and initially ignored the officer’s command to exit the building.

Ms. Stewart said her client was inside the Capitol for less than a minute, did not assault anyone or vandalize property.

During the sentencing hearing, Judge Walton criticized Mr. Goodwyn for having the “false impression” that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from President Donald Trump. “And there is just no proof whatsoever that that was, in fact, the case,” the judge said, according to the officialcourt transcriptfor the June 6 portion of the hearing.

It was Mr. Goodwyn’s appearance on Mr. Carlson’s Fox News program that drew some of the sharpest fire from Judge Walton. He called Mr. Carlson a “lightning rod” who “has said and done things that I think clearly have been divisive.”

Mr. Carlson gave the impression “that individuals who have been charged in reference to the events on January 6th of ‘21 have been treated unfairly,“ the judge said. ”And I see no evidence that, in fact, was the case.”

When being interviewed by Mr. Carlson, Mr. Goodwyn “made no attempt to correct the record,” Judge Walton said. “And when Carlson suggested that all the defendant did was go into the Capitol and walk around for less than a minute and leave, that just wasn’t correct. And that misinformation that is disseminated to the American public has contributed to the discord that now exists in our country in reference to the presidential election and what occurred on January 6th.”

The judge said Mr. Goodwyn “could have come clean and indicated exactly what he did when Tucker Carlson was minimizing the extent of what he did. Because he did more than what Tucker Carlson indicated. And he didn’t say anything to correct that.”

The judge said Mr. Goodwyn should be monitored during his supervised release to determine if he is spreading disinformation on social media.

“…Since he has used social media in order to provide what I consider to be disinformation about this situation,” the judge said, “I would require that he permit his computer use to be subject to monitoring and inspection by the probation department to see if he is, in fact, disseminating information of the nature that relates to the events that resulted in what occurred on January 6th of 2021.”

2024-04-07 20:25:00,DOJ Seeks Prison For Ashley Biden 'Showers With Dad' Diary Culprit,https://web.archive.org/web/20240408112119/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/doj-seeks-prison-ashley-biden-showers-dad-diary-culprit#comment-stream,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) is seekingprison timefor a woman who stole the diary of Ashley Biden, the president's daughter, before selling it toProject Veritasprior to the 2020 presidential election (and after an unsuccessfulattemptat selling it to the Trump campaign).

Aimee Harris, 40, and Robert Kurlander, 58, admitted they took part in aconspiracy to transport stolen materialsfrom Florida, where Ashley Biden had been living, to New York.

""Harris and Kurlander stole personal property from an immediate family member of a candidate for national political office,"" said Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

And whileVeritas- which wasraidedby the Biden DOJ in 2021 - elected not to publish the diary, theNational Filedid- revealing a passage in which Ashley Biden writes that she shared ""probably not appropriate"" showers with her father, Joe Biden.

Entries in the diary include the author revealingshe believes she was sexually molested as a child and shared “probably not appropriate”showers with her father,some that detail the author’sstruggle with drug abuseand the author’scrumbling marriage with multiple affairs, along with entries showing thefamily’s fearsof a potential scandal due to her brother’s new home, and those that show adeep resentment for her fatherdue to his money, control, and emotional manipulation. -National File

In a Tuesday letter to Judge Laura Swain,federal prosecutors sought 4-10 months in prisonfor Harris, followed by three years of supervised release. Prosecutors had previously sought six months of home confinement followed by three years of supervised release.

Prosecutors cay Harrisdelaying her sentencing hearing date 12 timesfor 'inadequate' reasons.

Defending Daddy Biden?

With the diary back in the news, leftist influencer Ed Krassenstein took to X todefend the Bidens' shower habits.

Ashley Biden's Diary FACT CHECK- We don't know if the Diary was unedited.- The Diary doesn't accuse Joe Biden of doing anything illegal to her. It merely says ""probably not appropriate,"" referring to being in the same shower as him at an unknown age.- Yes, people who find and…pic.twitter.com/8PdpqGDwlO

How Was The Diary stolen?

In the spring of 2020, as Joe Biden was in the process of clinching the Democratic presidential nomination, Ashley was living in Delray Beach, FL with said friend ""who had rented a two-bedroom house lined with palm trees with a large swimming pool and wraparound driveway,"" according to people familiar with the matter.

In June, however, Ashley visited the Philadelphia area as Joe's campaign was ramping up.

""She decided to leave some of her belongings behind, including a duffel bag and another bag,"" according to the report.

Several weeks after Ashley left the Delray house,the friend who hosted her invited an ex-girlfriend named Aimee Harris and her two children to move in. Harris, in the middle of a custody dispute and financial woes, appears to have been a Trump supporter according to 'social media postings and conversations.' She learned that Ashley Biden had stayed there, and that some of her things had been left behind, according to two people familiar with the mater.

Exactly what happened next remains the subject of the federal investigation. But by September, the diary had been acquired from Ms. Harris and a friend by Project Veritas, whose operations against liberal groups and traditional news organizations had helped make ita favorite of Mr. Trump.

In a court filing,Project Veritas told a federal judge that around Sept. 3, 2020, someone the group described as “a tipster” called Project Veritas and left a voice message. The caller said “a new occupant moved into a place where Ashley Biden had previously been staying and found Ms. Biden’s diary and other personal items.”

The “diary is pretty crazy,” the tipster said on the voice mail, according to a Project Veritas court filing. “I think it’s worth taking a look at.” -NYT

Harris and Kurlander each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property from an immediate family member of a former government official who was running for national office.

2024-04-07 21:00:00,The Geopolitics Of Chaos: Apocalypse Scenario IV,https://web.archive.org/web/20240408112119/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/geopolitics-chaos-apocalypse-scenario-iv#comment-stream,"Submitted byTuomas Malinen

In this entry I will expand the analysis we presented in theMarch Deprcon Outlookof GnS Economics. Issues discussed:

On 3rd April, Presidents of Finland and Ukraine, Alexander Stubb and Volodymyr Zelenskyi, signed adefense pactwith Ukraine. Finland has not signed such bilateral pacts with a war-going country since our President Risto Ryti signed a Ryti-Ribbentrop-pact in June 1944. The “pact” was actually just a personal letter from President Ryti to the leader of the Nazi-Germany, Adolf Hitler, where he vouched that he would not pursue peace with the Soviet Union (Russia). In exchange, Finland continued to receive military support and grain from Nazi Germany, which was crucial for her efforts to stop the ongoing major attack of the Soviet Union. President Ryti made the pledge under extreme pressure, as Finland was facing an imminent threat of invasion, and paid a heavy price. He was imprisoned for three years by a war crimes court (demanded by the Soviet Union) in 1946.

So, Finland signing a defense pact with a country in a direct conflict with Russia is utterly unheard-of, since WWII. It makes absolutely no sense for the security of Finland. It’s actually a threat to her security. Some could even call it an act of high treason. The most worrying part is the statement by President Stubb, when he was asked whether Finland would be sending troops to Ukraine. Hisanswerwas: “At this point there’s no need to send troops”. This opens a door for future deployment of Finnish forces to Ukrainian soil. What could possibly be the motive for this?

On Thursday, there was another major escalation, when the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinkenannouncedthat “Ukraine will become a member of NATO”. This was exactly what President Putin warned againstin 2008, when he (allegedly) said to President Bush that if Ukraine ever becomes a member of NATO, the country would cease to exist. Why an earth are western leaders deliberately pushing against a known red line of the Kremlin?

The European security structure has been based on unification and stopping conflicts in their tracks through negotiations since WWII. It was highly effective during the Cold War, while we’ve seen one major regional conflict in Europe since the Second World War, i.e., the Yugoslav Wars fought from 1991 till 1999, caused by the fall of the Communist Bloc. In 2004, we had the Georgian conflict and in 2014, the Ukrainian conflict begun.

What was notable in both Georgian and Ukrainian conflicts, was that they were caused by NATO and the EU coming too close to Russian borders in countries the Kremlin considered unstable. Simple-minded people assume that geopolitics is about fairness and justice. It’s not. It’s about security, period. China, Russia and the U.S. play ruthless geopolitical games. Just think, what would happen if Mexico would try to join a military alliance with Russia?

Yet, what we know from history is that when the European security structure crumbles, the world should tremble in fear. WWI and WWII, the most destructive wars ever fought, got started from failure of politics in Europe. Now we are on the path to failure, yet again. The question is why? Two plausible explanations rise above others.

The most plausible geopolitical explanation that I’ve seen on the Ukrainian conflict is that the U.S. wanted to eliminate the threat of the Eurasian alliance, which was forming between China, Europe and Russia. While it was a loose alliance, it was deepening. Russia provided ample raw energy, China was the production hub (factory) and Europe provided capital and know-how. Overtime, this could (would) have developed into a deeper alliance, which could very easily have risen to threaten the global hegemony of the U.S.

Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, one of the most influential geopolitical scholars ever lived (he passed away on the 26th of May 2017), noted in the conclusions of hismagnum opus,The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives (1997),that:

The time has come for the United States to formulate and prosecute an integrated, comprehensive, and long-term geostrategy for all of Eurasia. This need arises out of the interaction between two fundamental realities: America is now the only global superpower, and Eurasia is the globe's central arena. Hence, what happens to the distribution of power on the Eurasian continent will be of decisive importance to America's global primacy and to America's historical legacy.

This aim was achieved with the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war in late February 2022 (read update on24/12/2022on the controversy of who actually started the war). This could also explain, why the war continues. A peace between Russia and Europe would, most likely, re-start the construction of the Eurasian alliance. Perpetual war will guarantee that this does not occur, but this requires deepening escalation. We now seem to be on that road. However, the “Eurasian strategy” does not explain what is happening in the Middle-East.

Actions of Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in the Middle-East have been highly escalatory of late. The strike on the Iranian embassy in Damascus cannot be considered as anything other than a deliberate act of escalation. Embassies are sanctuaries everywhere, and striking one simply cannot be a “mistake”. The IDF leveling hospitals is also nothing short of a war crime. Yet, the world stands idly by. Why? Moreover, on Thursday, severalIranian military baseswere struck by a Jaish al-Adl, a Baluchi militant group, allegedly funded by the U.S., Saudi-Arabia and Israel. Iran has threatened to retaliate (understandably), which would lead to a deepening circle of escalation and, eventually, to a regional war, likely with verydire consequences. The United Arab Emirates also justannouncedthat it will cut all diplomatic ties with Israel.

The deepening escalation, by Israel and some U.S. backed forces, makes absolutely no sense, unless the aim is to ignite a regional war. One could argue that Israel could be looking to crush all threats it sees in the region in a regional war. However, the devastation to the world would likely be cataclysmic, leading to wide-spread chaos. Who could possibly want that?

In December, I floated the idea of a ‘group-over-groups’ pulling strings above our democratic and supranational institutions. My analysis was based on the Occam’s Razor principle, which states that when you seek a solution to any problem, you should only include the least amount of assumptions. A dark agenda by a very powerful group is a theory with the least amount of assumptions. It simply ticks all the boxes. From mypiece:

[…] behind every political decision is a force, which pushes it through. In the ideal situation, it’s the will of the people. A majority of the populace in a country want something, a majority of politicians want to get re-elected (and not to upset their supporters) and so they push the legislation through, more or less representing the will of the people. This is the ideal.

However, during the past three years, political leaders have made decisions that have been very detrimental to and/or objected to by the general populace on a global scale. These include multiple Corona lockdowns, money printing (leading to the inflation shock), two wars, sanctions hurting economies, the woke-agenda, and the de-farming agenda (see, e.g.,thisandthis). Their combination makes no sense in a national-political sense, because they create havoc. It’s also difficult to trace all of them to the motives of any of the major hidden lobbyist groups, like the military-industrial complex on which U.S. President Dwight D. Rooseveltwarnedalready in 1962.

I speculated that the aim of such a group could beDivide et Impera. This ancient principle, or strategy, translates as Divide and Rule (Conquer). The main idea is to create such large divisions between political parties, or whatever dominating parties, so that they cannot rise to challenge the rule subjected upon them, usually by an outside force. Ancient Romans used this strategy many times to enforce and cement their rule over their provinces. The strategy has four key elements (fromWikipedia):

We can see all in play in our western societies. Ordinary people have been divided based on artificial conditions, like vaxed/un-vaxed, pro-Ukraine/pro-peace, woke/conservative and those supporting all government actions vs. those opposing (this latter has existed in human societies for quite a while). Those that obey the agendas set by governments have been given full access to societies (during, e.g., Corona times), while those criticizing have been silenced and even imprisoned. In Europe, leaders of countries that followed the orders of unelected leaders of the European Union (Commission) received high positions in the EU power structure, while dissidents are discarded and even their careers sometimes destroyed. All local rulers, who rise to challenge the commands by the EU (like Victor Orbán in Hungary), have been defamed and even blackmailed. European nations have decades long histories of neglecting their defense spendings and now propositions are being made to fund the re-armament of Europe through the EU. “Meaningless” expenditures have of course been on the rise in western societies for a very long time.

When we subject the strategy ofDivide et Imperato policies enacted across the globe, we can seen similar developments everywhere. This enforces the view that there could actually be very an influential ‘group-over-groups’ spreading its agenda of chaos (Divide et Impera) across the globe.

Forecasting has become extremely speculative in recent years. This is because the developments we are witnessing do not fit to any standard analysis framework. It’s also really strange how intelligent people seem to have forgotten the brutal realities of geopolitics. Fairness and “right and wrong” simply do not fit into it, but that’s how the western propaganda is marketing things currently (Russia naturally has it’s own war propaganda). The propaganda operations run in the West since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war have been so effective that even Josef Goebbels would have envied them.

The question we should be asking is: while geopolitical realities are dominating developments, at least in Ukraine, is there a global agenda ofDivide et Imperabeing played in the background? If there is, who is pulling the strings? This need not be so, but if we do not ask these questions, we risk being played by forces seeking our demise. This is no time to be small-minded and/or naive.

The most frightening scenario is that the wars in the Middle-East and Europe will flare up within the next few months (or even weeks). Rallies in gold, oil and stocks of weapons companies suggests that something is up. Be prepared for extreme events.

During the presentation, which was part of the school's curriculum, Gray-Garcia covered her face with a keffiyeh and drew parallels between homelessness and the situation in the Gaza Strip, as shown in a video posted online.

The lecture titled “Housing (In)justice in LA: Addressing Unhousing and Practicing Solidarity” was delivered at the medical school’s Geffen Hall. Naturally, it triggered a complaint by the university’s Jewish Faculty Resilience Group.

Gray-Garcia has, on social media,claimedthat the October 7 attack was justified the next day.

She wrote: “As we hold our relatives in Occupied Palestine, and all of Mama Earth in prayer and love, we need to make connections. For us houseless, indigenous, swept/evicted people — we [are] not separate from this struggle — we suffer from the same settler colonial terror.”

She then wrote on November 1:“When you resist after decades of relentless policing, killing and terrorizing, that’s not ‘terrorism,’ that’s justice.”

Gray-Garcia said during her totally normal, well-adjusted speech:“Mama Earth was never meant to be bought, sold, pimped or played.""

The New York Postreportedthat Gray-Garcia posted on Tik Tok stating: “Not only are our bodies considered unclean in public, not only are our lives criminalized for being outside without a roof, but politricksters use us for their campaigns.”

The Post, citing theWashington Free Beaconwrote:

Gray-Garcia went on to note that California spent $30 million “on the removal of our houseless bodies” and asked students to think about how many homes could be built with that money“even in these inflated, ridiculous prices of commodified Mama Earth.”

At another point during the lecture,Gray-Garcia is said to have called modern medicine “white science”and said they were in “what the settlers call LA,” according to the Free Beacon.

She also reportedly led students in a chant of “Free, free Palestine,"" the report says.Riveting stuff.

Fox News spoke with some students about the event, one of which called it ""crazy"" and added: “I was very deeply offended and disgusted...I think even probably all students who stood up [during the prayer], a good number felt unsettled regardless of your religious persuasion.""

“I think a lot of the students have the sense that this is weird or out of place.”

The Jewish faculty group wrote to UCLA's Chancellor, saying it should have ""never"" taken place, according to thereport: “If anything of that ilk managed to occur on campus notwithstanding efforts to avoid it, the immediate obligation of all administrative staff should have been to end it immediately and to support the students who have been mistreated.”

“Instead, staff acted exactly to the contrary of their duties.” They wrote that Gray-Garcia also once came to campus wearing a “terrorist-themed costume.”

“At the point where the illusion becomes too expensive to maintain they will just take down the scenery, they will pull back the curtains, they will move all the tables and chairs out of the way, and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theatre.”

“In the past few years, you have been living within an escalating hybrid war. Globally, we have witnessed overt media control and propaganda campaigns; censorship, including arrests of people speaking in public; monitoring of all electronic communications and physical contact tracing; brutally enforced lock-down and masking requirements, with people being beaten, handcuffed, and arrested, even in their homes; suspension of healthcare services and weakening of healthcare systems; invasive testing requirements for employment and travel; forced quarantine of travelers; and coerced quarantine and “vaccination” of the healthy, general population.

Governments dropped all pretense of democracy and were emboldened to open despotism. There were no functioning checks on this power. The courts provided no effective recourse to the public. Governments broadly abused fundamental human rights using as justification prevention of the spread of infectious diseases, which are, in truth, a great many, ever-present, and continually evolving. And so, this justification, if allowed to stand, assures the end of democracy and installation of openly despotic government.”

–David Webb – The Great Taking

After being fortunate enough to participate in a two hour zoom call with David Rogers Webb, author ofThe Great Taking, I was intrigued enough to download his free book and read it over the course of two days. I found David to be a humble, intelligent, thoughtful man who is deeply concerned about the future of mankind, leading him to write a book, putting him and his family at great personal risk. Using his decades of experience in the financial world and undertaking painstaking research regarding the systematic long-term rewriting of codes, laws, and regulations by those who constituteBernays’invisible government (akaDeep State), Webb makes a strong case the Ruling Elite/Deep State/Shadowy billionaires in smoke filled rooms have set the groundwork to crash the global financial system and abscond with all that remains of our accumulated wealth. I could feel his angst and anxiety about the future as he explained the details of their plan. After reading the book, I found myself agitated, angry, and feeling helpless.

You can’t help but be depressed that everything you’ve worked for over the last forty years could be “legally” stolen by those controlling the levers of our financial system in an instant. My first reaction was, how can they do this and expect to succeed. Wouldn’t the citizens across the world react violently and start hanging the culprits? And then I remembered how the masses reacted to being locked down, masked, forced to not earn a living, censored for questioning the government, arrested for swimming alone in the ocean, imprisoned for protesting a rigged election, and being coerced and threatened into getting jabbed with a toxic gene altering concoction which neither protected you from contracting, spreading or dying from the annual flu (sold and marketed as the greatest deadly pandemic in history).

The covid scandemic was nothing but a dry run to see how far they could push their agenda, using authoritarian measures and the full power of the surveillance state and regime media, in scaring the masses into compliance. It worked like a charm, with the vast majority of the global population proving to be nothing more than scared compliant sheep. The ruling elite are feeling their oats and no longer feel bound to follow any laws, constitutions, or moral code.

They have shifted from relying onHuxley’s dystopian visionof a populace enslaved by pleasure, drugs, and technological distractions toOrwell’ssurveillance, fear, and boot on the face dystopia, where the masses will do as they are told, or else.The caressing is over, and the crushing has begun. When theGreat Takingcommences, it will be done ruthlessly, enforced by those with truncheons and automatic weapons, sold to the masses as the only way to save humanity, and enforced through the legal machinations they have surreptitiously put in place over the last two decades.

“People should either be caressed or crushed. If you do them minor damage they will get their revenge; but if you cripple them there is nothing they can do. If you need to injure someone, do it in such a way that you do not have to fear their vengeance.”

As David Webb lays out in painstaking detail in his book, using factual provable data and documentation, as opposed to the false narratives and propaganda spewed by those who have hatched this decades long diabolical plot to abscond with all of your hard-earned wealth, the ruling oligarchy have designed a financial system which will absolutely self-destruct when they choose to pull that lever. It has been premeditated and solidified in legal code that their scheme, through central banks and their co-conspirator financial institutions, will sweep all of your collateral (aka your financial wealth) into their grubby little hands, in order to save “the system”.

We will be left destitute, desperate, and indebted. With no means to service your debt, they will “legally” take the assets associated with that debt. Any rational critical thinking person who has been watching its government add $1 trillion to the national debt every 100 days, driving our annual interest on that debt to $1.6 trillion by the end of 2024, encouraging and aiding millions of third world diseased mutts to stream across our borders and be shipped to cities across the country, and purposely creating massive inflation while sabotaging our energy, food, and transportation systems, has to be asking what possible purpose could there be for these insane policies and actions. It only makes sense if their plan is to crash the global financial system on purpose.

David Webb is convinced that is the plan:

“Inevitably following the “Everything Bubble” will be the “Everything Crash.” Once prices of essentially everything crash and all financial firms rapidly become insolvent, these collateral management systems will automatically sweep all collateral to the Central Clearing Counter-parties (CCPs) and Central Banks. The trap, into which all nations have been herded, is ready and waiting to be sprung. There will be an epic end point to the decades of seemingly out-of-control financialization, which served no beneficial purpose for humanity, but the devastating effects of which are apparent even now. It has been a deliberate strategy executed over decades. This was the purpose of inflating the global bubble entirely out of proportion with any real-world thing or activity, which must end in disaster for so many, with no pockets of resilience allowed to remain in any country.”

–David Webb – The Great Taking

Your cognitive dissonance and normalcy bias tells you they could not and would not initiate such an evil plot. I know I don’t want to believe this could or will happen, because as a working professional for the last 38 years I’ve followed the rules and believed if I saved for my retirement, lived beneath my means, and invested my savings carefully, I would be rewarded with a relatively comfortable retirement. It is extremely difficult for me to comprehend how these psychopaths in suits, pulling the levers of this world, could hatch such a malevolent conspiracy, designed to cause so much misery and pain to so many.

But then I realize what they have done since 2019 with their totalitarian lockdowns, death jabs, surveillance mechanisms, imprisonment of dissenters, stealing of elections, destruction of societal norms, perpetuation of an invasion on our southern border, and provocation of global conflict designed to start World War 3. And yes, I do believe these traitorous billionaire scum would do this. David Webb shows how they did it before in 1933.

FDR shutdown all banks in the United States on March 6, 1933. Then Congress passed the Emergency Banking Act of 1933 on March 9. According to William L. Silber, who was an economic advisor to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Fed miraculously and suddenly in March of 1933 had the means “to supply unlimited amounts of currency to reopened banks”, which were, of course, only the banks selected by the Federal Reserve System.

The key point is the Fed chose which connected banks would survive and which banks would be permanently put out of business, resulting in millions losing their life savings. The Fed had the resources to keep thousands of banks open and avoid the pain and suffering for millions of Americans, but they purposely inflicted pain upon millions. Why? David Webb contends the Fed created the panic, provided a solution that benefited them and their crony banks, destroyed the lives of millions, and took their assets (homes, cars, farms, appliances) on a grand scale. This was done to inflict pain, vanquish the masses and foster a facade of power, which is as true today as it was then. Webb asks the relevant questions and provides the answers:

“Did “the bankers” need to take this property? What was the real purpose? Can you get past the idea that they were trying to help? Ask yourself: if they don’t want your money, and they don’t really want or need your stuﬀ, and they’re not trying to help you, what do they want? What’s the point of all of their eﬀorts? This may be diﬃcult to hear: It was a deliberate strategy. It was about ultimate, complete power, allowing no centers of resistance. And so, it was about deprivation. It was about subjugation—and it still is, in more ways than we know. It was not about helping people then, and it’s not about helping people now. It is all part of the same deliberate herding of humanity and elimination of any pockets of resilience, which plagues us still.”

–David Webb – The Great Taking

The Federal Reserve is owned by the Too Big To Trust Wall Street Behemoth Banks and does the bidding of the Deep State. The Fed is indemnified by the government (aka you and me) for any losses they incur, as they are currently sitting on $1 trillion of unrealized losses. They were a shadowy privileged institution in 1933 and have only become more powerful, shadowy, and corrupt today. They set the precedent of taking bank deposits from average Americans in the 1930s and will do it again without the slightest hesitation.

They have rigged the regulatory system in a way that makes anyone holding cash in banks an unsecured creditor with no enforceable claim to their own cash when they decide to crash the system. They won’t bail out the banks the way they did in 2008/2009. Too messy and time consuming. They will conduct a bail-in by “shifting” all your deposits from what you thought was your safe bank account to the accounts of a “protected class” created through legal machinations by our Deep State rulers. They did a test run in Cyprus in 2013. This is what is coming.

Since 2008 the Mega-Banks and Mega-Corps, with the patronage of the Fed, have achieved tremendous success in their endeavors to enrich themselves, while driving small businesses and small banks into bankruptcy, and impoverishing the masses they feign to embrace. Everything they do is built upon a foundation of lies, misinformation, disinformation, and propagandized narratives spun by their regime media co-conspirators.

Today’s “Everything Bubble” was created by the Fed, using the justification of “saving the world” during the Great Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 and “saving the world” again from the Great Flu Virus of 2020/2022 by lowering interest rates to zero for the most part of 15 years. The major Wall Street banks were all effectively bankrupt in the Fall of 2008 and should have been liquidated using our existing bankruptcy laws. Stockholders and bondholders would have been wiped out, while depositors would have been made whole. Their assets would have been sold off to smaller banks who did not take world destroying risks and leverage themselves 30 to 1.

Everything that has happened since 2008 has been nothing more than a vast pillaging operation disguised as saving humanity from a never-ending series of crises created by the very psychopaths who purposely created the crises in the first place. So why would it be so inconceivable to think they would initiate their final take down of the financial system, siphoning the remaining wealth of the masses?

How else can we explain the seemingly insane measures undertaken by the captured and controlled politician puppets, along with the central bankers (owned by Wall Street), and sold to the masses as normal by their regime media mouthpieces? They have secretively put all the pieces in place from a legal and regulatory standpoint to drain the remaining wealth from the financial accounts of tens of millions when they initiate the next planned and executed financial “crisis”.

Amidst the global chaos, as a wave of insolvencies sweeps the across the developed world, bloodshed from the ensuing global and civil wars scars the earth, wailing and gnashing of teeth by the victims reaches a crescendo, the Fed and their owners will not only survive, but thrive. We’ve seen this show before. During covid we needed to follow their orders so we wouldn’t die or kill our neighbors. It was all a lie. This time, with your money, investments, and assets purchased with debt in the hands of the few connected financial institutions, the fear will be putting food on the table, obtaining healthcare, and trying to survive.

Those in control will use their regime media propaganda outlets to paint the narrative, everything they have done is to insure the survival of our system. They will act like noble caretakers of humanity, doing whatever it takes for mankind, while initiating the entire financial system demolition in the first place. They are counting on the ignorant masses to remain ignorant, fearful, and terrorized, willing to do whatever they are told to survive. According to David Webb, the CBDCs will be their solution. It’s all about power and control, just as it has always been.

“The focus of the Atlantic Council is military strategy, not economics. And what is the Atlantic Council focusing on now? Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which is virtual money backed and issued directly by central banks. All G7 economies have now moved into the development stage of CBDC, and 18 of the G20 countries are now in the advanced stage of development. Why is this happening now globally? Is it really a desire to bring “financial inclusion” to the disadvantaged? Why would The Atlantic Council, a military strategy think tank, focus on CBDC? We are living within a global hybrid war, a component of which will be the collapse of the banking, money, and payments systems globally. War aims will be achieved by means other than kinetic war. The foremost aim of the people who have privately controlled the central banks and money creation is that they will remain in power, forever. They can risk no pockets of resistance.”

–David Webb – The Great Reset

They have been setting up the infrastructure for CBDCs, just as they rigged the financial system to abscond with your wealth, for over a decade, as they plan to force you into their new totalitarian electronic gulag. When they are confident their CBDC scheme is ready to launch, they will push the demolition button on the debt saturated house of cards, known as our financial system. When you wrap your head around their evil blueprint to enslave the world, you can make sense of what you see happening with your own eyes. What is happening is not normal. It makes no sense to any normal critical thinking person, but the majority of the population are addicted to their phones and believe whatever they are told by their government, regime media, Tik Tok influencers, and Facebook friends.

How could our “elected” leaders be adding $1 trillion to the national debt every 100 days, while jacking the interest on that debt to $1.6 trillion per year, unless they want to crash the financial system. How could our “president” (his handlers) encourage, sponsor, and facilitate the invasion of our country by millions of 3rd world, tuberculosis ridden, mutts, drug dealers, child traffickers, and terrorists, unless they want to collapse our cities and social welfare system?

How could our government medical agencies promote the poisoning of the masses with a gene altering Big Pharma jab, the mutilation of children because they were brainwashed by mentally ill left-wing teachers who told them they can be whatever sex they choose, drugging young boys who act like boys in an effort to make them like girls, and doling out anti-depressants like candy to middle aged unhappy cat ladies who bought the entire feminism narrative hook, line and sinker, unless they wanted to create a nation of physically and mentally damaged, easily manipulated drones?

In addition, they are attempting to destroy our energy infrastructure, our farmers, and small businesses, while attempting to ignite a civil war within our borders and a global war with Ukraine and the Middle East, to further spur a global collapse. First collapse, then controls through CBDCs.

“The key difference with the CBDC is the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that expression of central bank liability, and also, we will have the technology to enforce that. In other words: CBDC means absolute control and so, if the “old” money system somehow collapses, new money will be provided by the central banks in the form of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the new and improved control system. Imagine . . . it is chaos. You have lost everything but your smart phone (If you don’t have one, don’t worry—you will be issued one.) You will download an app. You will click boxes agreeing to everything. You will become increasingly indebted with each payment you make using the CBDC you are “given” on your phone. You will be told what to do and what not to do from then on. You will comply if you want to eat.”

–David Webb – The Great Reset

Deprivation and subjugation are their goals and being they are evil psychopaths; they have no empathy for you or your plight. They have moved into the Orwellian stage of power for its own sake and a boot stomping on your face forever. Webb contends the “Great Reset” is anti-human and will introduce a modern-day techno-feudalistic system, built upon a foundation of fear, scarcity, surveillance, and threats of violence for non-compliance.

A caste system more extreme than currently exists will separate the lords of the manor from the enslaved serfs. The first Great Depression was caused by the Fed, benefited the favored Wall Street banks, created a decade of deflation, bankrupted businesses, and destroyed the lives of the poorest. This Greater Depression will be far worse, as the immense consumer credit and mortgage credit bubbles will result in tens of millions losing their homes, automobiles, and various electronic gadgets bought on credit. Those who forget the past are condemned to relive it.

“When the “Everything Bubble” is imploded, we will face a deflationary depression, which will span many years, even decades. This coming Great Deflation is intrinsic to the Great Taking. The Architects of the Great Taking have planned and prepared to use this dynamic fully, secure in their knowledge that, as night follows day, massive and prolonged deflation will certainly follow the epic debt expansion super cycle, which they created. The Architects have assured that they alone are positioned to take everything, and that you and your children are positioned on the other side of that, i.e., to lose everything, to be enslaved and even destroyed by it. People will be knocked down, and not be able to get up again. That is intentional, as the populace has been systematically encouraged to go deeply into debt.

Whom the gods would destroy, they first cause to borrow at low rates of interest! As in the Great Depression, prolonged deflation will ensure that people who are in debt will not be able to make payments on their debts, let alone repay them. They will be trapped. All property and businesses financed with debt will be taken. With profound and persistent deflation assured to stretch over many years, debt becomes a powerful weapon of conquest. Debt is not a real thing. It is an invention, a construct designed to take real things.”

–David Webb – The Great Reset

Ever since reading Webb’s book my mind has been unsettled, trying to grasp how this could possibly happen, while trying to convince myself it won’t. We’ve muddled along for years and all predictions of collapse due to unsustainable debt growth have failed to materialize. My mind tells me Webb is right, while my heart hopes he’s wrong. But I know hope is not an option. No one in my financial position, or likely 99.9% of the population, will be able to avoid this accelerating train coming down the track.

Every non-insider on the planet will be negatively impacted by the Great Taking. The best we can do is prepare and prep based on our resources, location, family situation, abilities, and attitude. Eliminating debt, having cash-on-hand, having precious metals on-hand, being heavily armed, creating a local network of like-minded people, having no cash or investments in Wall Street banks, and even owning bitcoin in your private wallet, could help alleviate some of the pain from the“Great Taking”.

Webb recognizes we are already in a hybrid war against these psychopathic billionaire totalitarians bent on implementing theirGreat Reset, simultaneously with their Great Taking. It is a multi-front war waged on the financial battlefield, demographic battlefield, culture battlefield, technological battlefield, and ultimately will need to be settled on traditional battlefields across the globe. The level of malevolence required to perpetrate these heinous crimes against humanity is incomprehensible to the average person, therefore the masses don’t believe anyone would commit such acts. Webb knows these people exist and are capable of the vilest atrocities.

“Wars have always been not so much about taking things as about subjugation of populations on all sides. Vast destruction and death are acceptable to their planners. You might ask, how could the people plotting and executing such insane schemes be held together? I suggest that it has something to do with the binding power of shared guilt, of the criminal pact. The perpetrators are each and all bound, whether explicitly or unconsciously, by evidence of shameful, treasonous acts committed against their own people. The commission of crime is a power totem among them. The more heinous the crime, the more powerful is the binding force.”

–David Webb – The Great Taking

Based on my observations during the zoom call with David Webb, he struck me as a mild-mannered guy who is obviously nervous about the future of the world and can identify the culprits, based on their actions. Despite understanding their level of psychotic behavior and disregard for the future of humanity, he seems to think they can be defeated through non-violent means. I think that is a false hope, as you can only defeat power through superior power on a physical, intellectual, and spiritual level.

I do believe they are losing control, resulting in an acceleration of their plans, ramping up of violence, blatant disregard for laws or the Constitution, and mistakes and missteps on their part. Based on their need for an accelerated collapse, I have a hard time believing we make it to the November elections without a triggering event initiating the dominoes toppling, and all hell breaking loose financially, militarily, and on a societal basis. Their deceptions are being revealed and an increasing number of citizens are angry and unwilling to comply.

The“Great Taking”is a well thought out plan, but it is still just a plan. It can be thwarted and resisted if enough people awaken from their normalcy stupor. The odds are not in our favor, as the masses remain ignorant of what is coming, but the more people who can be awakened, the better our chances. We know the Deep State billionaire brain trust behind these schemes are heavily guarded and protected from us commoners. But these aren’t the heavily compensated apparatchik front men doing the day-to-day dirty work. These vile cogs in this machinery of destruction have names, addresses, and families. Fear works both ways. The good guys also have tech savvy individuals capable of throwing electronic monkey wrenches into the gears of the Deep State machinery."

2024-04-08 02:00:00,NATO: It's Time To Cull The Snake In America's Garden,https://web.archive.org/web/20240408112119/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/nato-its-time-cull-snake-americas-garden,"Authored by Tom Luongo via Gold, Goats, 'n Guns blog,

This week’s brouhaha in Brussels saw the Foreign Ministers of NATO emerge from their holes in the ground looking for food now that things are finally warming up for Spring.

And they had a message for us: more for them and less for us.They were ready to steal the food from our mouths, our children from our homes, to give Ukraine the aid it needs to beat Russia in a war only they seem to want.

They would strangle the political process at home to make this so. They would betray their basic roles as diplomats, speaking with forked tongues, to confound the conditions for dialogue with Russia and end the fighting.

In fact, with all the war mongering going on you would have thought this was a convocation of military commanders, not diplomats. But that’s where we are in this process.

The message of NATO’s foreign policy is simple,“War first. Talk later.”Facts on the ground don’t matter. Budget deficits don’t matter. Plunging public support for Ukraine doesn’t matter. All that matters is what these people want.

And they want war.But at the same time, they won’t admit that that is exactly what they are waging.

The doublespeak has gotten to the point where even Pinocchio is looking at outgoing General-Secretary Jens Stoltenberg going, “Dood. Your schnoze!”

Then again, Stoltenberg is a year past his ‘use-by’ date. He’s even more a lame duck than French President Emmanuel Macron at this point. The problem for those who actually run NATO, they can’t agree on who to replace him with… a British Neoconservative or a Dutch Neoliberal?

In the same week where the French and Russian Defense Ministers had a frank conversation about Ukraine, the attack in Moscow on civilians, and how quickly Russia will vaporize French troops sent into the fighting,we’re treated to the complete abandonment of all diplomatic pretense.

And even then, that discussion was more of a diplomatic endeavor than anything coming out of Brussels, ifMark Wauck and Alex Mercouris are correct.

Mercouris, of course, has a lot more to say, but that’s the long and the short of it. It was all a pathetic game, transparently so. The Russians were forced into this war, but now that they’re in it they’re in it to win. Mercouris sums it up:

The Russians are not under any pressure to negotiate. They are winning the war and they know they’re winning the war. The West, if it wants to avoid a spectacular geopolitical disaster—which is what a defeat in Ukraine would be— in its own interests needs to talk to the Russians. But coming up with half baked proposals such as a return to Istanbul or a Frozen Conflict is going to get nowhere. It is only going to annoy the Russians even more. The logical and right thing to do is to ask the Russians what it is, exactly, in Ukraine that they want to achieve, and see whether it might be possible for the West to meet them halfway. I would have thought that is basic obvious diplomacy.

It’s been so long here in the US where we’ve had a Secretary of State who wasn’t hell bent on a war with Russia, Iran, or China (or all three consecutively and concurrently) we’ve forgotten what having diplomats looks like.

I mean think about it. Antony Blinken’s sad dog-eye technique makes you wistful for the days of Condoleeza Rice’s angry diversity hire routine.

The difference between then and now is Putin hadn’t quite told NATO to “piss off.”

Again, can anyone remember that as late as 2007 Vladimir Putin was invited to speak at the annual Munich Security Conference. Back then he was just as willing to tell the West what they needed to hear rather than wanted to hear as he is now, but at least we put up the pretense of listening to him.

Blinken is only competent in the role of anti-diplomat. And why he’s worse than Rice or even *shudder* Hillary Clinton, is that he’s not even consistent. One week looking for an off-ramp after the terror attack in Moscow. This week mouthing words about Ukraine joining NATO knowing that that’s the road to a US war with Russia.

But, Mercouris and Wauck both believe this is some kind of bluff by Blinken. I’d like to believe they are correct.Nat. Sec. Adviser Jake Sullivan cracking a ribcanceling his trip to Saudi Arabia may speak to that. I mean, there’s a high probability of that when you “fall down the stairs” or whatever excuse he gave.

As is this morning’s rumor that the US has told Iran they won’t be upset if Iran hits Israel hard in retaliation over the attack on Iran’s embassy in Damascus earlier this week. Israeli citizens seem to believe this rumor, looking for the exits, stocking up on toilet paper, etc.

Today we can see what’s fundamentally wrong with NATO in this clearly over-produced shite with an extended steady cam shot that would make Stanley Kubrick green with envy… or just green.

NATO’s 75th … a Foreign Ministers’ meeting … and what needs to happen nextpic.twitter.com/bvat4wu84C

With all respect to Macron’s right hook, who else is producing this level of propaganda?Who is always driving this bus towards the edge of the cliff? Who is going to put more pressure on Speaker Mike Johnson to pass a Ukraine aid bill that he’s held at bay from these vipers for nearly 6 months?

Exactly who you would expect if you still have three functional brain cells and a passing acquaintance with something known as ‘history.’

The only good thing I have to say about David Cameron’s political resurrection is that he’s no Winston Churchill.

I don’t know about you, but I get tired of writing and saying that NATO hasn’t been fit for purpose since the end of the Cold War. If that’s the case then why did they just get shiny new headquarters, new members, and every Western leader screaming for them to have more money?

We all know why. And that’s the fundamental problem.

NATO is the entangling alliance that the Founders warned us about back in the 18th century.And it’s high time we crafted a way out of the trap that membership in it represents. As a deterrent against future aggression NATO can be seen as a necessary thing. But, like all organizations facing the end of its lifespan, it had to find new ways to retain its relevance after we bled out the USSR with a deft combination of defense spending and $8 per barrel oil.

This is also why the Cold War never really ended. It just shed its skin and NATO along with it. The problem with most of the analysis about the current conflict is that we’re all stuck (including myself at times) within the nation-state framework.

The US needs this. The UK needs that. Russia needs something else.

But that framework is inadequate to describe the everything that’s going on unless you map the geographic unit to thedominantglobalist faction within each region of the West. And they each have very different agendas and goals with respect to Ukraine and Russia.

I wrote about that last week,quoting this month’sGGnG Newsletter.It bears repeating this week:

Ukraine became the battleground physically for this. To the EU, the US and the UK, through their influence in Poland and the Baltics, were used to foment this war. Bankrupting them{and Russia}through war forces them back to being subjugated sources of raw materials while exporting EU laws and rules to those places which have the privilege (from their perspective) of doing business with them.From all three players’ perspectives if Ukraine beat Russia, then they win. Putin is eventually deposed, Russia is humiliated, and the long-desired breakup of their land-based empire would commence.Europe gets their Great Reset. The UK gets to maintain control over the maritime empire, reclaiming NATOcontrol over the Black Sea, and forcing the Arab oil producers back in line. The US gets to leverage a fallen Russia to weaken China and stop the further integration of the BRICS into a competitor.

In short, the world would go back to the 1990’s when guys like Bill Browder were running around buying up everything and the Russian oligarchs Putin beat would be restored to power. Fukuyama would finally be right.

But, as I said, the real goal of this war wasn’t just getting Russia, they had to maneuver the US into a terminal state as well, through the costs of fighting a war we weren’t capable of sustaining. And that was the bridge too far for US interests not beholden to the ghost of Trotsky and the tears of Bill Kristol.

NATO cannot and should not survive these stresses if its intended victims, Russia/China/Iran, fight even remotely competently.

And they are. They all understand that this is a race against a political and economic clock in the West that is quickly counting down to zero. All Russia has to do is keep grinding out territorial gains in Ukraine, Iran to not over-react to Israel’s provocations, and China to ignore the yapping over tariffs and Taiwan.

And all the Americans who are tired of this have to do is keep the money spigot to NATO and Ukraine closed off as much as is politically possible.

So, this is why we’re seeing the full court press from both the UK and EU to get the US re-focused on the task at hand in Ukraine. It’s why everyone on Capitol Hill hates Speaker Mike Johnson and why the knives are out from all sides, including his own party.

Yeah, I’m lookin’ at you Marjorie Taylor Greene….

Because the US is clearly looking for a way to extricate itself from this mess, even if all the puff adders on K Street want to do is pivot towards China.

The cost/benefit analysis for the US, especially in an election year, just doesn’t add up. And there is zero real leverage Europe can apply to the US other than through their bought and paid-for politicos in D.C. for more money.

The heart simply isn’t willing anymore.Why? For all the reasons I’ve been talking about for six years here, the memories of WWII are fading. The generations of Americans imprinted with the post-WWIIPax Americanalie are dying off (Boomers) or no longer care, if they ever did (Gen X).

The Millennials and ‘Zoomers’ aren’t invested in this mythology. They know they’re the heads are on the chopping block.

They can see that none of this is in their best interests. The US, as a nation at war with itself, will try one last time this fall to vote its way out of Europe before it gets ugly here. Listen again to Cameron’s harangue carefully. There is an implicit threat not just in the language but the staging of it.

Make no mistake, folks. These people are the enemy of all that’s good and decent in the world. We have plenty of snakes here in the US doing their bidding, selling us the old lies repackaged as new ones, and acting outside the bounds of the law. There’s plenty of blame to spread around here.

But what’s becoming obvious is that the era of extra-curricular US warfare is over. A lot of people refuse to look at the cover of the TPS report for fear of ‘getting the memo.’

Sadly, most of them work at NATO, and we’re not skimming fractions of pennies here.

The Europeans will never be able to replicate the time-tested Hegemon money laundering machine...

The awful shadow of some unseen PowerFloats tho’ unseen amongst us, -visitingThis various world with as inconstant wingAs summer winds that creep from flower to flower.-Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower,It visits with inconstant glanceEach human heart and countenance;Like hues and harmonies of evening,-Like clouds in starlight widely spread,-Like memory of music fled,-Like aught that for its grace may beDear, and yet dearer for its mystery.-Shelley,Hymn to Intellectual Beauty

As the de facto North Atlantic Terror Organizationcelebrates its 75th birthday, taking Lord Ismay’s motto to ever soaring heights (“keep the Americans in, the Russians out, and the Germans down”), that thick slab of Norwegian wood posing as Secretary-General came up with a merry “initiative” to create a 100 billion euro fund to weaponize Ukraine for the next five years.

Translation, regarding the crucial money front in the NATO-Russia clash: partial exit of the Hegemon – already obsessing with The Next Forever War, against China; enter the motley crew of ragged, de-industrialized European chihuahuas, all in deep debt and most mired in recession.

A few IQs over average room temperature at NATO’s HQ in Haren, in Brussels, had the temerity to wonder how to come up with such a fortune, as NATO has zero leverage to raise money among member states.

After all, the Europeans will never be able to replicate the time-tested Hegemon money laundering machine.For instance, assuming the White House-proposed $60 billion package to Ukraine would be approved by the U.S. Congress – and it won’t – no less than 64% of the total will never reach Kiev: it will be laundered within the industrial-military complex.

Yet it gets even more dystopic: Norwegian Wood, robotic stare, arms flailing, actually believes his proposed move will not imply a direct NATO military presence in Ukraine – or country 404; something that is already a fact on the ground for quite a while, irrespective of the warmongering hissy fits by Le Petit Roi in Paris (Peskov: “Russia-NATO relations have descended into direct confrontation”).

Now couple the Lethal Looney Tunes spectacle along the NATOstan front with the Hegemon’s aircraft carrier performance in West Asia, consistently taking its industrial-scale slaughter/starvation Genocide Project in Gaza to indescribable heights – the meticulously documented holocaust watched in contorted silence by the “leaders” of the Global North.

UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese correctly summed it all up: the biblical psychopathology entity “intentionally killed the WCK workers so that donors would pull out and civilians in Gaza could continue to be starved quietly. Israel knows Western countries and most Arab countries won’t move a finger for the Palestinians.”

The “logic” behind the deliberate three tap strike on the clearly signed humanitarian convoy of famine-alleviating workers in Gaza was to eviscerate from the news an even more horrendous episode: the genocide-within-a-genocide of al-Shifa hospital, responsible for at least 30% of all health services in Gaza. Al-Shifa was bombed, incinerated and had over 400 civilians killed in cold blood, in several cases literally smashed by bulldozers, including medical doctors, patients and dozens of children.

Nearly simultaneously, the biblical psychopathology gang completely eviscerated the Vienna convention – something that even the historical Nazis never did – striking Iran’s consular mission/ambassador’s residence in Damascus.

This was a missile attack on a diplomatic mission, enjoying immunity, on the territory of a third country, against which the gang is not at war. And on top of it, killing General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, commander of the IRGC’s Quds Force in Syria and Lebanon, his deputy Mohammad Hadi Hajizadeh, another five officers, and a total of 10 people.

Translation: an act of terror, against two sovereign states, Syria and Iran. Equivalent to the recent terror attack on Crocus City Hall in Moscow.

The inevitable question rings around all corners of the lands of the Global Majority: how can these de facto terrorists possibly get away with all this, over and over again?

Four years ago, at the start of what I later qualified as theRaging Twenties, we were beginning to watch the consolidation of an intertwined series of concepts defining a new paradigm. We were becoming familiar with notions such as circuit breaker; negative feedback loop; state of exception; necropolitics; and hybrid neofascism.

As the decade marches on, our plight may at least have been alleviated by a twin glimmer of hope: the drive towards multipolarity, led by the Russia-China strategic partnership, with Iran playing a key part, and all that coupled with the total breakdown, live, of the “rules-based international order”.

Yet to affirm there will be a long and winding road ahead is the Mother of All Euphemisms.

So, to quote Bowie, the ultimate late, great aesthete:Where Are We Now?Let’s take thisvery sharp analysisby the always engaging Fabio Vighi at Cardiff University and tweak it a little further.

Anyone applying critical thinking to the world around us can feel the collapse of the system. It’s a closed system alright, easily definable as Liberal Totalitarianism. Cui bono? The 0.0001%.

Nothing ideological about that. Follow the money. The defining negative feedback loop is actually the debt loop. A criminally anti-social mechanism kept in place by – what else – a psychopathology, as acute as the one exhibited by the biblical genocidals in West Asia.

The Mechanism is enforced by a triad.

1.The transnational financial elite, the superstars of the 0.0001%.

2.Right beneath it, the politico-institutional layer, from the U.S. Congress to the European Commission (EC) in Brussels, as well as comprador elite “leaders” across the Global North and South.

3.The former “intelligentsia”, now essentially hacks for hire from media to academia.

This institutionalized hyper-mediatization of realityis(italics mine), in fact, The Mechanism.

It’s this mechanism that controlled the merging of the pre-fabricated “pandemic” – complete with hardcore social engineering sold as “humanitarian lockdowns” – into, once again, Forever Wars, from Project Genocide in Gaza to the Russophobia/cancel culture obsession inbuilt in Project Proxy War in Ukraine.

That’s the essence of Totalitarian Normality: the Project for Humanity by the appallingly mediocre, self-appointed Great Reset “elites” of the collective West.

A key vector of the whole mechanism is the direct, vicious interconnection between a tecno-military euphoria and the hyper-inflationary financial sector, now in thrall with AI.

Enter, for instance, AI models such as‘Lavender’, tested on the ground in the Gaza killing field lab. Literally: artificial intelligence programming the extermination of humans. And it’s happening, in real time. Call it Project AI Genocide.

Another vector, already experimented, is inbuilt in the indirect assertion by toxic EC Medusa Ursula von der Lugen: essentially, the need to produce weapons as Covid vaccines.

That’s at the core of a plan to use funding of the EU by European taxpayers to “increase financing” of “joint contracts for weapons”. That’s an offspring of von der Lugen’s push to roll out Covid vaccines – a gigantic Pfizer-linked scam for which she is about to beinvestigated and arguably exposedby the EU’s Public Prosecutor Office.In her own words, addressing the proposed weapons scam: “We did this for vaccines and gas.”

Amidst all the action in this vast corruption swamp, the Hegemon agenda remains quite blatant: to keep its – dwindling – predominantly thalassocratic, military hegemony, no matter what, as the basis for its financial hegemony; protect the U.S. dollar; and protect those unmeasurable, unpayable debts in U.S. dollars.

And that brings us to the tawdry economic model of turbo-capitalism, as sold by collective West media hacks: the debt loop, virtual money, borrowed non-stop to deal with “autocrat” Putin and “Russian aggression”.That’s a key by-product of Michael Hudson’s searing analysis of the FIRE (Finance-Insurance-Real Estate) syndrome.

Ouroboros intervenes: the serpent bites its own tail. Now the inherent folly of The Mechanism is inevitably leading casino capitalism to resort to barbarism. Undiluted savagery – of the Crocus City Hall kind and of the Project Gaza Genocide kind.

And that’s how The Mechanism engenders institutions – from Washington to Brussels to hubs across the Global North to genocidal Tel Aviv – stripped down to the status of psychotic killers, at the mercy of Big Finance/FIRE (oh, such fabulous seafront real estate opportunities available in “vacant” Gaza.)

How can we possibly escape such folly? Will we have the will and the discipline to follow Shelley’s vision and, in “this dim vast vale of tears”, summon the transcending Spirit of Beauty – and harmony, equanimity and justice?

2024-04-08 06:30:00,What Is Driving Gold To All-Time Highs?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240408112119/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/what-driving-gold-all-time-highs#comment-stream,"Submitted byBullionStar/Jesse Colombo

After more than three years of stagnation, gold has awakened with a vengeance since early-March and has promptly surged by nearly $300 an ounce or 14% to an all-time high $2,330—a sharp move for a safe-haven asset that has a reputation for its slow and steady trends. Gold’s powerful rally came seemingly out of the blue and has confounded the majority of investors and commentators who have been much more focused on trendy speculative stocks and cryptocurrencies as of late. In this piece, I will explain several of the technical and fundamental factors that are driving gold to all-time highs, what is likely ahead for gold, and how investors can best take advantage of the yellow metal’s resurgence.

A Look at the Technicals

The chart of gold over the past year shows how it suddenly sprang to life over the past month. AsI had explainedin my last blog post on March 1st, there was an important technical resistance zone from $2,000 to $2,100 that had been acting as a price ceiling for gold since the middle of 2020. Gold’s successful close above that zone signified that a new rally had begun even though the fundamental drivers of it weren’t exactly apparent just yet.

The multi-year gold chart shows the significance of the $2,000 to $2,100 resistance zone and how gold kept bumping its head at that level until it finally pushed through in the past month:

Gold’s multi-decade chart shows that it has been steadily climbing an uptrend line that began in the early-2000s as the U.S. and other countries kicked off an unprecedenteddebt bingethat shows no signs of stopping whatsoever:

Gold is Rising Despite the Strong U.S. Dollar

What’s particularly interesting and notable about gold’s surge over the past month is how it has occurred independently of the action in the U.S. dollar. Gold and the U.S. dollar have a long-established inverse relationship, which means that strength in the dollar typically causes weakness in gold, while dollar weakness typically causes the price of gold to rise.

The chart below compares gold (the top chart) to the U.S. Dollar Index (the bottom chart) and shows how action in the dollar often causes an opposite trend in gold. Gold’s recent surge took place while the dollar was trending slightly higher, which is a sign of gold’s strength due to its ability to buck the negative influence of the strengthening dollar.

Mainstream Investors & Journalists Missed Gold’s Rally

What is also worth noting is how gold’s surprising recent rally has received very little mainstream attention by a press that is much more enamored with hot AI stocks as well as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that have recently benefited from the U.S. government’s approval of a number of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which has resulted in tremendous inflows from institutional investors and retail investors alike.

As the chart below shows, investors have pulledbillions of dollarsworth of funds from gold ETFs in order to re-invest in Bitcoin ETFs, which is ironic considering its timing shortly before gold’s liftoff (and is confirmation of contrarian investing principles). The continuation of gold’s bull market will likely lead to funds flowing back into gold ETFs, providing additional fuel for the rally.

Central Banks Are Steadily Accumulating Gold

Though Western retail investors (who are often considered to be the “dumb money"" in the market) have been sleeping on gold before and even during its surge of the past month, central banks—particularly those in Russia, China, Turkey, and India—have been steadily accumulating practically all of the gold that they can get their hands on. According to the World Gold Council, central banks purchased a healthy 1,037.4 metric tons of gold in 2023 in an effort to diversify out of the U.S. dollar and other fiat currencies that are being debased at an alarming rate and into a hard asset with a six-thousand year history as sound money that cannot be printed.

Though virtually all of the world’s currencies have been downgraded to pure fiat or paper currencies that are not backed by gold since 1971, many of those currencies are indirectly and implicitly backstopped by gold due to the held by many countries. For example, the U.S. officially holds 8,133 metric tons of gold, Germany holds 3,353 metric tons, Italy holds 2,452 metric tons, France holds 2,437 metric tons, Russia holds 2,333 metric tons, and China holds 2,192 metric tons of gold. In a serious currency crisis, a country’s gold reserves is likely to be one of its only saving graces, which is why many countries are accumulating gold at such a rapid pace.

Chinese Investors Are Buying Up Gold

Chinese investors who are seeking refuge from the country’s sinking property and stock markets are another important driver of gold’s nascent rally. Starting in the mid-2000s, China’s property and stock markets embarked on a seemingly unstoppable bull market as the country’s economy grew rapidly and the country began to increasingly flex its economic and geopolitical muscles on the world stage. Unfortunately, likeJapan in the 1980sandUS in the mid-2000s, China’s asset boom was actually an unsustainable bubble that was driven bycopious amounts of debtand reckless speculation.

As all bubbles eventually do, China’s property and stock market bubbles have burst over the past year causing at least hundreds of billions of dollars worth of losses—including$100 billionalone from the country’s property tycoons. As faith in China’s economy and financial markets sinks, investors are turning to the old standby, gold, which has thousands of years of history in China as a superb store of value in good and bad times alike. When complex financial systems and products fail, as they currently are in China, savers and investors appreciate the simplicity and straightforward nature of physical gold. As the famous financier J. P. Morgan once said, “Gold is money. Everything else is credit.""

According to the World Gold Council, consumer demand for gold in China increased by a stout 16% in 2023, while demand for gold bars and coins rose by an even more impressive 27%. Retail gold buying in China has been dominated by the younger generations who face a difficult job market and are largely priced out of the country’s unaffordable housing market but find physical gold to be attainable—even if it means buying tiny amounts of it at a time as funds allow. Indeed, one of the most popular gold bullion products among young Chinese aregold beansthat weigh as little as one gram and cost approximately 600 yuan (USD$83).

How Inflation is Contributing to Gold’s Recent Rise

Another important factor driving gold’s recent rally is stubbornly high inflation that is not easing as quickly as economists had hoped and may instead be on the verge of a resurgence. Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation and is very adept at sniffing out rising future inflation rates. U.S. year-over-year inflation—as measured by personal consumption expenditures—increased at a 2.5% rate in February, which caused traders to slightly dial back their expectations for Federal Funds Rate cuts this year.

Though U.S. inflation is still elevated, there is good reason to believe that the Fed will still go through with their plans to cut rates this year, which should prove to be beneficial for the price of gold. According to Bank of America’s commodities strategistMicheal Widmer,“The market is interpreting that the Fed is willing to accommodate higher inflation as it cuts rates.”

What is worth paying attention to in particular is the sharp surge in commodities prices over the past month, which is likely an indication of higher rates of inflation in the future:

Similarly, crude oil increased by 10% over the past few weeks:

U.S. wholesale gasoline prices have spiked by approximately 30% in the past two months and are one of the most psychologically important and visible indicators of inflation in the minds of everyday consumers:

Gold is Benefiting From Political Uncertainty

In addition to being a hedge against inflation, gold is also a hedge against economic and political uncertainty. In 2024, more than 60 countries are set to hold national elections, which makes it one of the most active global election years in a very long time, earning it the moniker “The Super Election Year."" The United States, Mexico, India and Indonesia are just some of the countries that are holding national elections this year.

Economic issues, including inflation, are the top concern for Americans who will most likely choose either President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump to be the next U.S. president in a redux of the hotly-contested 2020 presidential election. President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have earned a reputation for heavy spending and racking up the national debt, which are major reasons why they are blamed for the United States’ inflation problem. Based on that view, a potential Biden win would be beneficial for the price of gold.

How Geopolitical Tensions Are Helping Gold

As if there were not enough uncertainty and confusing cross-currents in the world already, rising geopolitical tensions in a number of hot-spots are also helping to boost the price of gold. The Russia-Ukraine war has taken a turn for the worse recently after Russia shot down53 Ukrainian dronesand the Kremlin warned that Russia and NATO are now in “direct confrontation.” Ukraine claimed that it destroyed least6 Russian fighter jets, damaged eight more, and killed or injured 20 service personnel.

In addition, the Israel-Hamas war has now reached the six-month mark and shows no signs of de-escalation. On the contrary, Iran is now increasingly involved in the fray afterIsrael struck, numerous Iran-backed targets in Syria, which has now resulted in Iran vowing to retaliate, which is putting the world on edge and supporting the price of gold and crude oil.

(Our documentary, “Gold in Times of Crisis Ep 1 - Passage out of Vietnam"" highlights the importance of holding gold in times of geopolitical uncertainty.)

How Declining Production Supports the Price of Gold

Another factor that is supporting the price of gold is the stagnating and declining production of gold from mines around the world. After rising steadily each year since 2010, global gold production peaked in 2019 at 3,300 metric tons and has since been declining even as the price of gold rocketed 66% from $1,200 to roughly $2,000 in 2023. Many experts believe that the world reached “peak gold"" in 2018, which means that the amount of economically viable gold deposits around the world has peaked and entered into a terminal decline. Supporting that theory is the US Geological Survey’s alarming estimate that all known gold reserves could be depleted in justseventeen years.

Why You Should Invest in Gold

As I’ve discussed in this piece, gold is in a confirmed uptrend and there are numerous factors that are driving that uptrend. To learn more about the additional monetary and fiscal factors that are driving gold’s bull market, I recommend taking a look at my other recent piece, “What you need to know about gold's long-term bull market."" To summarize, gold is rising in response to the alarming debasement of paper currencies and the ballooning global debt burden that guarantees a serious currency crisis in the not-too-distant future.

While many of today’s most popular financial products are only a few decades old at most and the average lifespan of a fiat currency is measured in mere decades, gold has helped humans preserve their wealth from all sorts of fiscal and monetary shenanigans perpetrated by governments for at least six-thousand years. Though we live in a highly complex world that is increasingly dependent on technology (and likelytoodependent on technology), the simplicity of physical gold is one of its many strong points—especially when complex systems experience upheaval and failure.

There are countless modern investment products that aim to help investors gain exposure to gold, but most of those are “fool’s gold"" rather than the real deal. There are gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), gold futures and options, contract for differences (CFDs), other derivatives, and gold mining shares, but those are justpaperclaims on gold instead of actual gold that you hold free and clear. In times of serious crisis and chaos, as I expect we are heading into, there is no substitute for physical gold bullion that is in your possession and completely unencumbered by any other claims.

On Sunday morning, Flight 3695, a Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by Southwest, was taking off from Denver International Airport to Houston when passengers heard a loud bang and recorded the moment the engine cowling ripped off the plane.

Scary moments for passengers on a Southwest flight from Denver to Houston when the engine cover ripped off during flight , forcing the plane to return to Denver Sunday morning.pic.twitter.com/BBpCBXpTsl

Part of the engine cover ""peeled off within the first 10 minutes"" of the flight, Lisa C. toldABC News, adding, ""We all felt kind of a bump, a jolt, and I looked out the window because I love window seats, and there it was.""

The FAA told ABC News and other corporate media outlets that it's investigating the incident involving Flight 3695.

Another passenger told ABC: ""People in the exit row across from me started yelling up to the flight attendants and showed them the damage.""

Southwest Airlines toldBusiness Insiderin a statement that Flight 3695 experienced a ""mechanical issue,"" and its maintenance team was inspecting the aircraft Sunday afternoon.

""Our Customers will arrive at Houston Hobby on another aircraft, approximately three hours behind schedule,"" the budget carrier said in a statement.

Not a week goes by that some major incident involving Boeing planes, whether it is a tire falling off, runway excursions, engine fires, hydraulic leaks, pilot seats flailing around the cockpit and slamming the yoke, and or external panels ripping off.

We continue to ask whether these mid-air mishaps aresabotage or just shoddy maintenance.

2024-04-08 07:20:00,Hardly Anyone Is Short Treasuries; Perhaps They Should Be,https://web.archive.org/web/20240408112119/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/hardly-anyone-short-treasuries-perhaps-they-should-be,"Authored by Simon White, Bloomberg macro strategist,

Survey data shows thatoutright shorts in US Treasuries are near lows.But investors are missing a trick as inflation risks point to higher bond volatility and yields.

JP Morgan’s Treasury Survey tracks their clients’ positioning in Treasuries, asking them whether they are long, neutral or short. The net of the positions is close to flat, but outright shorts are unusually low, with the number of clients saying they are positioned that way near the nadir for the 20-year history of the survey.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Commitment of Traders data has speculators net short Treasuries, but this ishugely distorted by basis trading(i.e. cash bonds versus futures). However, a position proxy for bond futures (see here) showspositioning is falling but is still net long.

(This proxy, whose methodology is explained in the chart, circumvents the distortion to Commitment of Traders data from the basis trade, i.e. trading the cash bond versus the future.)

The survey rings true in that traders are reducing long Treasury bets as recession risks have receded, but are still reluctant to go outright short.

But bond yields look to be coiling for a larger move.

Bond volatility has been falling, despite upside growth and inflation risks.

There is a yawning disconnect between inflation volatility and bond volatility.Uncertainty in inflation has been rising, and that typically means more volatile yields.

The gap is likely to be closed by rising bond volatility, and given the inflation backdrop, yields are poised to remain elevated.

The few bond shorts that are out there look to be in good shape.

""The flagrant conduct of obstruction of Brazilian justice, incitement of crime, the public threat of disobedience of court orders and future lack of cooperation from the platform are facts that disrespect the sovereignty of Brazil,"" wrote de Moraes - who Musk called ""Brazil's Darth Vader"" over the weekend.

Brazil’s Darth Vader!

While X initially said in a Saturday post that they wouldcomply, blocking certain popular accounts in Brazil -Musk said an hour later, after the release of the ""TWITTER FILES BRAZIL,"" that they would not,noting that ""As a result, we will probably lose all revenue in Brazil and have to shut down our office there.""

in a Sunday post, Musk said that Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes had ""brazenly and repeatedly betrayed the constitution and people of Brazil,""and should ""resign or be impeached.""

De Moraes said that as part of his decision to open an inquiry, that ""X shall refrain from disobeying any court order already issued,including performing any profile reactivation that has been blocked by this Supreme Court,""Reutersreports.

The justice said that Musk would face a fine that equates to approximately $20,000 each time an account is reactivated on X.

BRAZIL IS ON THE BRINKI’m reporting to you from Brazil, where a dramatic series of events are underway.At 5:52 pm Eastern Time, today, April 6, 2024, X corporation, formerly known as Twitter, announced that a Brazilian court had forced it to “block certain popular accounts in…pic.twitter.com/GjdAgmkCBo

The TWITTER FILES BRAZIL, reported by investigative journalist Michael Shellenberger, and colleagues David Ágape and Eli Vieira, reveal that ""Brazil is engaged in a sweeping crackdown on free speech led by a Supreme Court justice.""

Sitting members of Brazil’s Congress and journalists were among those named by Brazil’s highest court for censoring,Mr. Shellenberger said of his findings, which he hassharedon X.

He named lower house members Carla Zambelli of former President Jair Bolsonaro’s Liberal Party and Marcel van Hattem of the NOVO party as targets of orders targeting posts the court deemed misinformation.

According to the internal files Mr. Shellenberger shared,Twitter in Brazil was threatened with a $30,000 fine. The company had one hour to remove the Congress members’ posts or pay the court for noncompliance.

The article reports that the justice had even been jailing individuals without trial for things posted on social media.

According to Mr. Shellenberger,Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraesallegedly made demandsto Twitter to allow access to its internal data,in violation of Twitter’s own policies on the handling of user data. -Epoch Times

The ""Twitter Files"" also show thatthe justice “sought to weaponize Twitter’s content moderation policies against supporters of then-president @jairbolsonaro,”Mr. Shellenberger said—a similar trend to what the “Twitter files” revealed was happening to former PresidentDonald Trumpand conservative voices in the United States.

The origin of the order to censor Brazilians’ posts was also revealed in the internal Twitter files, Mr. Shellenberger said.

Brazilian Attorney General Jorge Messiasbacked de Moraes, saying in a post on X: ""We cannot live in a society in which billionaires domiciled abroad have control of social networks and put themselves in a position to violate the rule of law, failing to comply with court orders and threatening our authorities.""

In a Sunday evening post, Musk told users in Brazil that they can use a VPN to access X.

Meanwhile, a cautionary tale for what Democrats want to do in the United States...

They want to stack the deckhttps://t.co/CnRNrraBGF

And an interesting thread...

We’re entering very interesting territory where non-state foreign actors can challenge state sovereignty in very direct ways 👇🧵/1pic.twitter.com/NITERV9cij

This power has been available for a while of course, the GAE (Global American Empire) used it to manipulate many different color revolutions and the Arab spring, but that power has always been wielded by regime-aligned actors.

With Elon’s purchase of Twitter we see the possibility of a rogue elite who could deploy this power without prior regime approval.An information autocracy wielding its power independent from the GAE in the name of free speech

The GAE has been terrified of this possibility which is why it has been using all of the tricks it learned abroad to shutdown free speech at home@MikeBenzCyberhas already done a great job laying this out on@TuckerCarlson.

No elite class worth its salt simply hands over power due to something ridiculous like an electionso the name of the game in a liberal democracy where popular sovereignty is the legitimating mechanism of power is information control.

It’s impossible for voters to actually know everything they need to know to make an informed decision first hand so they rely on the media

If you control the information people receive you effectively control democracy.

Elon’s ability to unilaterally defy foreign governments in the name of a people he doesn’t know or represent is a huge threat to the sovereignty of the state.

This isn’t a knock on Elon, the Brazilian government seems horrible and I’m sure many people there support Elon’s actions.

But when analyzing the situation purely from a position of power politics it becomes clear what a threat this posses.

Modern states that want to continue to exist as a sovereign power can’t allow this.

Again many organizations aligned with the GAE got away with it because they were essentially protected by the might of the empire.

They were unofficial arms of the global hegemon.

Nowmany people believe Elon is in the tank with the regimeand is only ever acting in their interests. I’m doubtful but that possibility can’t be dismissed.

But if he is willing to defy the GAE then Elon’s status as an unaccountable information autocrat actually makes him a big danger to the soft managerial oligarchies that operate the nations of the GAE.

In a world of democracies ruled by oligarchs skilled in information manipulationthe greatest danger may be an unelected (corporate) dictator who is dedicated to free speech.

“Here comes an avalanche of [Climate Change™] bullshit.” -Marla Singer

Xi Jinping’s effeminate sex toy, Justin Trudeau — no matter what they say, everybody wants a sexy white bitch for arm candy once they get a bit of money and power. See: NFL and NBA — took to state media airwaves to deliver a message to the Deplorables about how their farmed tax money will be put to use.

ViaThe Daily Messenger:

“The Canadian Government willinvest C$8.4 million (US$6.1 million) toinvestigate how climate change affects the decline of democracy, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saidon Wednesday (20 March).

The Canadian premier delivered the remarks during his virtual participation at the Third Summit for Democracy convened by South Korea.

‘Today, I'm announcing thatCanada is investing C$8.4 million on research across the global south to better understand how climate change interacts with democratic decline,’ Trudeau said.

The world is confronted to growing insecurity tied to armed conflicts and climate change, Trudeau said. The funding will also assist in preserving the human rights of environmental defenders, he said.

Canada is increasing and expanding its funding for non-profit organization Acces Now in a bid to ensure human rights defenders and others who may face digital threats, have the proper tools to protect themselves, Trudeau added.”

https://twitter.com/TrueNorthCentre/status/1770924834282721744?t=4O6kQwVVN3DL60d__JFqvA&s=03

Climate Change™ policy, not the invented Climate Change™ itself, certainly poses an existential threat not just to democracy but to humanity itself — just not in the way Xi Jinping’s bottom bitch wishes to convey.

ViaNetZeroClimate.org:

“Net zero refers to a state in which the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere are balanced by removal out of the atmosphere.

The term net zero is important because – for CO2 at least – this is the state at which global warming stops…

Different terms (Carbon Neutral, Net Zero, Climate Neutral) point to different ways in which emissions sources and sinks are accounted for in context. They help to indicate what is and is not included in the calculation or a target. Net zero is the internationally agreed upon goal for mitigating global warming in the second half of the century. The IPCC concluded the need for net zero CO2 by 2050 to remain consistent with 1.5C. So, the purpose of this site is to inform effective climate action that is net zero aligned in order to advance progress towards this goal.

Many actors will be able to achieve absolute zero or zero emissions, hence the choice of terms in the global ‘Race to Zero’ campaign focused on raising ambition. Others will need to scale up removals either themselves directly or by supporting other projects.”

Some relevant points:

·       Humans exhale carbon dioxide. There will never be any such thing as “absolute zero” until all animal life is snuffed out on Earth.

·       Cultivation of staple crops that sustain the human population,like rice, necessarily emit greenhouse gases, including carbon. There will be no “absolute zero” until agriculture is stamped out.

Related:Climate Change™ Roundup: Backyard Gardens in Crosshairs

Nonetheless, continuing:

“No [greenhouse gas] emissions are attributable to an actor’s activities across all scopes. Under this definition, no offsets or balancing of residual emissions with removals are used.

A valid end-state target.”

Let us turn to our friendly nerd overlord with the man-breasts for further elaboration on what “absolute zero” carbon entails:

“The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent…

Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year— over 26 billion tons… And somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero… This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication…

So you’ve got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero, and that’s going to be based on the number of people, the services each person is using on average, the energy, on average, for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy. So let’s look at each one of these, and see how we can get this down to zero.Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.” [audience laughter]

-Bill Gates, Self-Appointed Climate Change™ Commissar, 2010

“Joya Patiha,a 43-year-old Indonesian transgender woman, first started tonotice that changing weather patternsin the mountain-ringed city of Bandungwere affecting her income as a sex worker a decade ago.

The rainy season was lasting longer across the West Java province, winds were stronger and in some particularly bad years Patiha lost up to 80% of her earnings.

Trans women like Patiha are among the most affected by extreme weather linked to climate change, as well as suffering disproportionately when disasters strike.

“No one is coming out during the longer rainy season,” said Patiha. “It is very hard to make money during that unpredictable weather.”

Indonesia is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, andtrans women, who tend to face more stigma and marginalisation than trans men or other LGBTQ+ Indonesians,are also among those hardest hit by extreme weather.

That’s becausemany trans women, like Patiha,are shut out of the formal economy and survive as buskers and sex workers, occupations that rely on them being able to solicit clients outdoors.”

TL;DR: Indonesian transgender streetwalkers (who refuse to use Tinder for some reason) can’t solicit sex on the street of Jakarta during rainy season even though they could just wear a raincoat and suck it up (metaphorically) and this is Climate Change™’s fault for being racist and transphobic.

…This is how you can know for sure none of this climate change propaganda is actually about saving the planet. If it were — if climate change were the existential threat the social engineers profess to be concerned over — they wouldn’t be unnecessarily inserting various Social Justice™ pet projects into the narrative, thereby guaranteeing popular resistance.

This is a two-fer: inventing a new method of social control and taxation while sewing social division and enraging the populace, setting one segment against the other, while power is claimed by the ruling class — classicdivide and conquerstuff I have written about before.

The good news is: I canguaranteethat the proportion of the Indonesian population that would be swayed by this Social Justice™ drivel clocks in at less than 1%. The only ones who would care are those educated abroad in the West, the vehicles (along with the NGOs they found) by which the technocrats hope to import this nonsense into the Third World.

So far, it hasn’t taken.Inshallah, it never will.

“LGBTQ+ individuals are sometimes blamed for problems related to climate change, according to Arif Budi Darmawan, a researcher at the Bandung-based Resilience Development Initiative.

‘Those outside the binary category are often labelled with the category ‘deviant’, (and) associated with the causes of environmental problems and disasters,’ said Darmawan, who has researched how climate change affects trans Indonesians…

The group also surveyed 80 members of the trans community in Jakartato find out how climate change affected incomes, frequency of illness, and changes in spending from 2021 to 2022.

Nearly93% of respondents saw decreased income during the rainy season, and 72% had increased expenses.”

Having been to Jakarta myself — which is otherwise a lovely city, by the way — I can say for sure that the actual environmental problem with the city is thatit’s sinking fast and will soon possibly be underwater, a reality evident even to the untrained eye.

Further, I spent quite a bit of time walking the streets of Indonesia myself — as a tourist, not a hooker — and I can’t say I spotted a single transgender the entire time. And, as a Bangkok veteran, onthatscore, I have a quite well-trained eye.

Social media posts urging people not to take ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19 have been taken down by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The FDA removed posts from X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn that stated: “You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously y'all. Stop it.”

The posts hadremained upeven after the regulatory agency agreed to take them down aspart of a settlementin a legal case brought by doctors who said the posts wrongly interfered with their practice of medicine.

The March 21 settlement said the FDA would take down specific posts within 21 days. The posts were made in August 2021.

The FDA has also deleted the following posts:

An Aug. 21, 2021, Instagram post that said: “You are not a horse. Stop it with the #ivermectin. It’s not authorized for treating #COVID.”

An April 26, 2022, Twitter post that said: “Hold your horses ya'll. Ivermectin may be trending, but it still isn’t authorized or approved to treat COVID-19.”

The posts directed people to an FDA webpage titled, “Why You Should Not Use Ivermectin to Treat or Prevent COVID-19.” The page itself acknowledged that the FDA has approved ivermectin for some uses but said “taking a drug for an unapproved use can be very dangerous” and “currently available data do not show ivermectin is effective against COVID-19.”

The agency pointed to a database of clinical trials testing ivermectin against COVID-19; some of the trialsshowedthe drug works against the illness.

Doctors commonly prescribe FDA-approved drugs for a range of purposes, including some outside the scope of approval. The practice is known as off-label prescription.

The FDA’s ivermectin posts gained tremendous traction across social media and news outlets, prompting internal excitement, emailsobtained by The Epoch Timesshowed. Millions of people saw the posts. “That was great! Even I saw it!” Dr. Janet Woodcock, the agency’s acting commissioner at the time, said in one missive.

The FDA has not alerted its followers on social media that it removed the posts.

2022, celebrated the development.

The case “sets an important legal precedent which should deter them from attempting this stunt again anytime soon,” she wrote on X. In another post, she said that “the terms we were asking for were met when we agreed to settle” and “we were not optimistic about what we would get in discovery.”

But while the posts and page have been removed,the FDA hascreated a new pageabout ivermectin and COVID-19.

Published on April 5, it states: “One of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s jobs is to carefully evaluate the scientific data on a drug to be sure that it is both safe and effective for a particular use. There continues to be interest in a drug called ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in humans. The FDA has not authorized or approved ivermectin for use in preventing or treating COVID-19 in humans or animals.”

The page repeats the statement that “the FDA has determined that currently available clinical trial data do not demonstrate that ivermectin is effective against COVID 19 in humans,” but lacks the link to the database showing mixed results from trials.

The page also says that “health care professionals may choose to prescribe or use an approved human drug for an unapproved use when they judge that the unapproved use is medically appropriate for an individual patient.”

An FDA spokesperson previously told The Epoch Times that the settlement was not an admission of a violation of law or any other wrongdoing.

“FDA has not changed its position that currently available clinical trial data do not demonstrate that ivermectin is effective against COVID-19,“ the spokesperson said. ”The agency has not authorized or approved ivermectin for use in preventing or treating COVID-19.”

Everybody talks a good gamewhen asked about environmental concerns. But theyunderestimate what real “climate action” will cost them,personally,and they’re prone to balking when they figure it out.

In 2018, The Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicagoconducted a surveyof 1,202 people asking them if they thought climate change was an issue, and if so, how much were they willing to contribute, out of their own pockets, towards “fixing it”:

71% of the respondents said that climate change was a reality, and most of those thought human activity was largely responsible for it.

57% said they’d be willing to spend $1/month, or $12 annually.

23% were willing to go big: $40 a month, in order to “fix” climate change.

A more recent study of ten European countriesin 2021 found that most people feel as though they are already doing their part to live a climate conscious lifestyle – and further – they are individually doing more than those in the media, or their governments (hold that thought).

In other words, while most respondents believed that there was an impending climate crisis, they also believe they had already made all the personal lifestyle adjustments they’ll need to make in order to address it.

These attitudes are pretty typical of a populace who has already undergone massive conditioning by the media and academia around climate alarmism, but who otherwise live largely insular, bubble-wrapped lifestyles and think food comes from Uber Eats.

They have no idea that  that climate targets, like “netzero” or Agenda 2030 will cost more them more than a few hundred bucks a year, per person, to “fix”.

Even with carbon taxes becoming more prevalent – citizens think the extent of the impact on their lives are the economic pressures of them inexorably rising (here in Canada, the carbon tax went up 23% on April 1st, the same day all federal Members of Parliament got a pay raise).

That’s bad enough – but people are still completely unprepared for what has already been decided from on high for their personal destinies:

“De-carbonization” requires “#degrowth”, a euphemistic hashtag that really meansforced austerity on all of humanity– save for those apparatchiks imposing it on the rest of us.

The Big Lie of climate alarmism is threefold:

That the climate goals of netzero and decarbonization can boost the economy and increase prosperity for all

That achieving said goals will afford us control over the climate and alter the planetary physics of the earth itself

That this is all “settled science”

Let’s look at each of these in order:

Many politicians like to gaslight us that there is a way achieve netzero targets in an economically beneficial manner. A good example, again here in Canada – is the carbon tax.

Everybody pays the carbon tax – on gas, on flights, onheating their homes, etc. Most households get a “carbon tax rebate” – which is invariably, forless moneythan they have paid in carbon taxes. This is borne out in countless analyses on this, including the government’s ownParliamentary Budget Office report,whichfound that:

“most households will experience a net loss of income from the federal carbon tax, even after rebates.

Specifically, in fiscal year 2024-25, 60 per cent of households in Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Manitoba will pay more in carbon taxes than what they receive in rebates, after accounting for both direct and indirect costs of the carbon tax.By 2030, 80 per cent of households in Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and P.E.I. will be worse off, as will 60 per cent of households in Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador.

Indeed, according tothe PBO estimates, the carbon tax will cost the average Canadian household between $377 and $911 in 2024-25—even after rebates, with Albertans being the most affected.Asthe carbon tax escalates annually, the financial burden will intensify.By 2030, the carbon tax’s average net cost for Canadian households will rise to $1,490 in Manitoba, $1,723 in Saskatchewan, $1,820 in Ontario and $2,773 in Alberta.”— ViaFraser Institute

Yet the Trudeau government frames the rebate as “free money” for Canadians, and demonizes anybody who wants to “Axe The Tax” as though they are trying to take moneyawayfrom taxpayers.

The Libs are going keep doubling-down on the nonsensical claim that#AxeTheTaxwould actually take money away from Canadians.It's an IQ test and if you believe that, you failed.https://t.co/KRDxETQqy6

If decarbonization was economically viable, then it would be happening on its own, without governments and the corporate media relentlessly brainwashing us to do it.

For example, we would probably have mini-nuclear reactors all over the place by now if private industry was given some latitude to implement it.

Instead we have millions of hectares of wind turbines that are only “green”ifyou can amortize the carbon inputsover 30 or 40 years.Alas, the typical wind turbine is cooked within a decade (that’s if they don’texplodefirst). Apparentlythey can’t be recycled, either. It’s actually making the situation worse.

There has perhaps never been a more grandiose and categorically impossible vision for humanity than the one where technocrats and experts can massage the trajectory of global climate through the judicious employment of carbon taxes, personal carbon footprint quotas and forced collectivism.

On the planetary level – it makes no difference if a country like Canada decarbonized 100% – compared to the emissions of China alone. Right now they’re lighting up two new coal fired plantsevery week.Wake me up whentheydecarbonize.

Not to mention numerous other countries who have no intention of foregoing their shot at economic prosperity at the behest of already an affluent (not to mention overly sanctimonious), West…

“Let me stop you right there…”Caribbean nation Guyana is booming after discovering oil. BBC’s Stephen Sackur puts it to President@presidentaligy; lobbyists say oil is bad for the climate.Dude wasn’t having it. Mans was ready!pic.twitter.com/awy8OPIW2q

The discrepancies in values and aims between nation states already makes the100% conformitythat climate action requires a non-starter.

That doesn’t even account for things we absolutely can’t controllike the solar system itself.

The best and brightest minds can’t even get interest rates right, nor “manage the economy” and that’s near 100% human driven. What are we supposed to do about the elephant in the room in terms of the single most relevant driver of climate cycles here on the planet: the sun?

Our sun outputs an estimated6 billion timesmore energyper secondthanall of humanity generates and consumes in an entire year. It is the likeliest candidate for what drives long term heating and cooling cycles, not only here on earth – but throughout the entire solar system.

Granted – that energy radiates in all directions – if you only count all the energy that actually hits earth, that number drops: to100 million timesannual energy usage,per second.

No amount of carbon taxes or collectivism is going to overpowerthat.

Decades of propaganda and operant conditioning has browbeat the public into believing, or at least not arguing, that “the science is settled” when it comes to climate. One of the most well worn tropes around this is “97% of climate scientists agree” that “humans are causing global warming”.

Marc Morano’s,‘The Politically Incorrect Guide To Climate Change’, (essential reading) years ago exposed the origin of that magical number, “97%”:

In 2013, Australian researcher John Cook analyzed 11,944 peer-reviewed papers on climate change, from which the famous, mystical 97% figure emerged. It later came out (via UN lead author Richard Tol), that of those papers, 66.4% expressed “no opinion at all” on human-caused global warming. Those wereeliminated.

The minority of papers that were left, and did express an opinion, were mostly on the same page, and Cook took his 97%from that.

What is actually true, however, from the study’s own numbers, is this:

11,944 papers were analyzed

7,930 of them expressedno opinionon AGW (66.4%)

97% of the remaining 4,013 papers did

So it turns out that 97% of climate scientists donotagree that humans are causing global warming. It was more like32.5%(97% of 33.6% of 11,944).

Doesn’t have the same punch, does it?

Of course, since then, 97% became Holy Canon. So much so that any climate scientists who knew what side of the bread the butter was on, got the message loud and clear: your academic career depends on aligning with the consensus.

So called “climate deniers” are continually deplatformed and countervailing data suppressed. This may be changing, again owing to widespread disenfranchisement with how the “experts” managed the pandemic, the public seems to be more questioning."

Entirely as predicted, Police Scotland has been deluged with vexatious and politically-driven ‘hate crime’ reports, with one top official complaining “we cannot cope.”

Didn’t see this one coming.

Under the new legislation, anyone deemed to have been verbally ‘abusive’, in person or online, to a transgender person, including “insulting” them could be hit with a prison sentence of up to seven years.

That instantly led to a flood of bad faith reports, including from conservatives making a mockery of the system and from deranged left-wing activists trying to punish their ideological adversaries.

David Threadgold, Chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, said that the new legislation was being exploited to pursue personal and political vendettas.

“Police Scotland have gone public and said that on every occasion, reports of hate crime will be investigated,”Mr. Threadgold told the BBC.“That creates a situation where we simply cannot cope at the moment.”

“When you have vexatious complaints, people who look to weaponise this legislation or who make these complaints for personal gain or political point scoring, then that creates a problem for the police which can affect public satisfaction in my organisation,”he added.

As we previouslyhighlighted, Police Scotland admitted that the new law could create “additional demand” and create a “resource implication” for police.

This followed a trial of a separate program set to be implemented across the country to stop investigating crimes like theft and criminal damage, which authorities acknowledge will help criminals.

As wereportedyesterday,out of the more than 8000 reports police have received under the new ‘hate crime’ law, less than one per cent are leading to investigations.

Police Scotland are having topayofficers in their control room “hundreds of thousands” in overtime to deal with the onslaught of frivolous reports.

However, that’s still nearly 800 new investigations in a single week for a police force that already has stretched resources.

It’s been a complete disaster, but they can’t say nobody warned them.

2024-04-09 03:30:00,More Russian LNG Being Exported To Europe Than Asia,https://web.archive.org/web/20240409124721/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/more-russian-lng-being-exported-europe-asia,"By Charles Kennedy ofOilPrice.com,

Russia’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports gained over 4% in the first quarter of this year as it increased output to replace sanctioned pipeline gas exports to Europe, Russia’s Kommersant newspaper reported on Monday.

Citing a 4.3% (8.7 million metric ton) increase in unsanctioned LNG exports in Q1 2024 based on data from Kpler, Kommersant.ru saidexports to the European Union were rising, while those to Asia were declining. Russia’s LNG exports to Asia for the first quarter of the year saw a 7% decline, which was made up for by a 4% increase in exports to Europe, which received some 5 million tons of Russian LNG during that time period. The bulk of LNG production in Russia comes from the Yamal LNG project, run by Novatak, and the Sakhalin Energy project, run by Gazprom.

In late March, Moscow moved to sell Shell’s minority stake in the Sakhalin LNG project to state-run Gazprom for $1 billion. Initially, Moscow was planning to give the stake to Novatek in the wake of Shell’s move to abandon the project after Western regimes sanctioned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. According to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, Novatek has deemed its participation in the Sakhalin project to have high legal risks.

The new data showing the rise in Russian LNG exports to the European Union indicates that Europe has replaced piped Russian gas from its eastern ports with Russian LNG at its western ports as the bloc becomes the biggest buyer of Russian LNG, clocking in half of all Russian LNG export volume this year so far, followed by China, which scooped up 21% as of February data.

Reuters data analysis in February also showed that the EU has replaced Russian piped gas flows with Russian LNG imported primarily to Spain, Belgium and France.

2024-04-09 04:15:00,Judge Reduces Roundup Verdict Against Bayer From $1.5 Billion To $550 Million,https://web.archive.org/web/20240409124721/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/judge-reduces-roundup-verdict-against-bayer-15-billion-550-million,"A judge in Missouri has significantly reduced a jury award against Bayer AG's Monsanto unit, cutting down the punitive damages from a $1.5 billion verdict to about $550 million,according to Fortune.

This decision comes amid Monsanto's ongoing legal battles over allegations that its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer. While the judge, Daniel Green, declined Monsanto's request for a new trial or to dismiss the verdict entirely, the reduction in damages provides some financial relief to Bayer.

The company, which acquired Monsanto for $63 billion in 2018, plans to appeal the entire verdict, arguing that the damages are still excessively high.

The original verdict awarded three plaintiffs a combined $61.1 million in actual damages and $500 million each in punitive damages for claims that Roundup use led to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

The punitive damages were adjusted to align with Supreme Court guidance, which suggests punitive awards should not exceed 10 times the actual damages.

Fortunereportedthat Bayer has already allocated up to $16 billion to settle over 100,000 similar cases, and it's now facing a new wave of litigation.

The company has also committed to replacing glyphosate in its U.S. consumer Roundup products with other weed-killing ingredients. The Missouri case, involving plaintiffs from across the U.S., highlights the ongoing controversy and legal challenges surrounding Roundup and its alleged health risks.

“While the court reduced the unconstitutionally excessive damage award, the company believes that the court did not apply the law correctly on damages,” the company commented.

Jay Utley, a lawyer for the former Roundup users, added: “The judge actually agreed with the plaintiffs’ suggestion the punitive-damages amounts be reduced to nine times their actual damages.”

He concluded: “The awards align with the evidence of Monsanto’s willful, malicious, and reckless disregard for the safety of consumers and the injuries suffered by these plaintiffs.”

When launching The Line in 2021, the Saudi government had announced that 1.5 million people would be living in the city by 2030.Officials now expect there to be fewer that 300,000 residentsby that time, according to a source cited byBloomberg.

The source said that officialsexpected only 2.4km of the 170km city to be completed by 2030. As a result of the scaling back, one contractor dismissed some of the workers it employs on site, according to a document seen by Bloomberg.

Neom - part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 strategy to diversify the economy and move away from oil reliance - is being built in the northwestern Tabuk province.

Middle East Eyereportedlast year that construction was under way on The Line, based on satellite imagery.

The Line is due to have no cars or roads, anda high-speed rail service running across the length of the city, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced three years ago.

Two parallel, mirrored buildings that are nearly 500 meters tall and 120km wide are also planned as part of the project, according todesigns uncovered in 2022.

In addition to the horizontal city, Neom is also touted to include aneight-sided citythat floats on water, aski resort with a folded vertical village, and a Red Sea luxury island resort called Sindalah. The Sindalah project is due to open later this year.

Sources told Bloomberg that work was continuing on other parts of the Neom project, and Saudi officials still backed the overall aims of The Line.

The sources added that Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which is providing most of the funding for the project, has yet to confirm its 2024 budget for Neom.

The scaling back of the megacity project comes as the Public Investment Fund cash reservesdropped to $15bnin September, its lowest levels since 2020.

Peter Pellegrini, a pro-Russia candidate is elected President of Slovakia. Prime Minister Robert Fico is also pro-Russia.The EU further splinters.

Reuters reportsPellegrini Wins Slovak Presidential Election in Boost for Pro-Russian PM Fico

Slovak nationalist-left government candidate Peter Pellegrini won the country’s presidential election on Saturday, cementing the grip of pro-Russian Prime Minister Robert Fico over the country.

Fico, who took power for the fourth time last October, has turned the country’s foreign policy to more pro-Russian views and initiated reforms of criminal law and the media, which have raised concerns over weakening the rule of law.

Slovak presidents do not have many executive powers, but can veto laws or challenge them in the constitutional court. They nominate constitutional court judges, who may become important in political strife over the fate of Fico’s reforms, which would dramatically ease punishments for corruption.

Pellegrini, 48, said his victory meant the government would have support in its aims, and not face an “opposition, opportunistic power centre” in reference to outgoing liberal president Zuzana Caputova.

The independent Korcok, 60, was Slovakia’s envoy to the EU and later ambassador to the U.S., before taking the foreign affairs portfolio in centre-right governments in 2021-2022. At the time, Slovakia was a staunch ally of Ukraine, providing it with air defence and fighter jets.

Pellegrini has portrayed Korcok as a warmonger for his support for arming Ukraine and suggested he could take Slovak troops into the war in the neighbouring country, which Korcok denied.

The EU is increasingly fragmented over Ukraine, agricultural policy, and energy policy. There is no chance that the EU increases its push towards EVs.

The European parliament elections are in June and the centrists rate to take some huge losses, especially in France, but all across Europe.

The EU is increasingly dysfunctional. Rules make it near impossible to implement any major changes on the Euro, trade policy, and fiscal policy rules, areas that require unanimity to make changes.

In areas where countries can decide individual actions such as support for Ukraine, Slovokia now firmly joins Germany and Hungary in a pro-Russia stance.

My heartfelt congratulations to@PellegriniP_on his overwhelming victory at the Slovak presidential elections. A big win for the people of 🇸🇰 and a big win for the advocates of#peaceall around Europe! Blahoželáme, pán prezident!

Macron is increasingly isolated in France for wanting to stand up to Putin. That will hurt him the parliamentary elections.

On March 21, I reportedEuropean Council President Calls on Europe to Switch to a War

As a way to create jobs, EC President Charles Michel promotes a war economy. Where that would lead is obvious.

Solidarity With Ukraine

Solidarity with Ukraine is drying up everywhere. Support is “so deep” that in the EU it died over wheat. Seriously. It’s not just Poland. Farmers across the EU are hopping mad over Ukrainian wheat and corn.

Fortunately, Michel’s call is going nowhere for two reasons.

The first is support for Ukraine is waning. The second and more important is fiscal rules would prevent it.

And it’s impossible to change the fiscal rules.

The EU never enforced its Growth and Stability Pact or Maastricht Treaty rules. The crisis is coming to a head with France and Italy in the spotlight. The first casualty will be Green policy.

The EU never enforced its Growth and Stability Pact or Maastricht Treaty rules. The crisis is coming to a head with France and Italy in the spotlight. The first casualty will be Green policy.

On March 16, I notedUkraine Won’t Win the War, It’s Time for a New Strategy

Support for Ukraine is waning in the US and has totally dried up in Germany. French president Emmanuel Macron is making a symbolic last stand but it’s more likely to backfire than help Ukraine.

In Germany, SPD, the lead party in the ruling coalition, openly supports a partition of Ukraine.

In the US, Biden is making a big push for Ukraine with no stated goals or endgame.

It will be interesting to see what concoction Speaker Mike Johnson come up with, but more money will do nothing but prolong the war.

Why is this our battle anyway when Europe increasingly does not give a damn? Don’t we have enough problems here on our own border?

While all these events and associated instability have serious ramifications on our company, colleagues, clients and countries where we do business, their consequences on the world at large — with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people, escalating tragedy in the Middle East and the potential restructuring of the global order — are far more important.

As these events unfold, America’s global leadership role is being challenged outside by other nations and inside by our polarized electorate.We need to find ways to put aside our differences and work in partnership with other Western nations in the name of democracy. During this time of great crises, uniting to protect our essential freedoms, including free enterprise, is paramount. We should remember that America, “conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,” still remains a shining beacon of hope to citizens around the world. JPMorgan Chase, a company that historically has worked across borders and boundaries, will do its part to ensure that the global economy is safe and secure.

In spite of the unsettling landscape, including last year’s regional bank turmoil, the U.S. economy continues to be resilient, with consumers still spending, and the markets currently expect a soft landing. It is important to note that the economy is being fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and past stimulus. There is also a growing need for increased spending as we continue transitioning to a greener economy, restructuring global supply chains, boosting military expenditure and battling rising healthcare costs.This may lead to stickier inflation and higher rates than markets expect. Furthermore, there are downside risks to watch.

Quantitative tightening is draining more than $900 billion in liquidity from the system annually — and we have never truly experienced the full effect of quantitative tightening on this scale. Plus the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East continue to have the potential to disrupt energy and food markets, migration, and military and economic relationships, in addition to their dreadful human cost.

These significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain cautious.

And he warns that investors seem too complacent about these geopolitical risks when it comes to markets.

Geopolitical and economic forces have an unpredictable timetable- they may unfold over months, or years, and are nearly impossible to put into a one-year forecast. They also have an unpredictable interplay: For example, the geopolitical situation may end up having virtually no effect on the world’s economy or it could potentially be its determinative factor.

We have ongoing concerns about persistent inflationary pressuresand consider a wide range of outcomes to manage interest rate exposure and other business risks.

Many key economic indicators today continue to be good and possibly improving, including inflation. But when looking ahead to tomorrow, conditions that will affect the future should be considered. For example, there seems to be a large number of persistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue.

All of the following factors appear to be inflationary:

ongoing fiscal spending, remilitarization of the world,

restructuring of global trade,

capital needs of the new green economy,

and possibly higher energy costs in the future (even though there currently is an oversupply of gas and plentiful spare capacity in oil) due to a lack of needed investment in the energy infrastructure.

In the past, fiscal deficits did not seem to be closely related to inflation. In the 1970s and early 1980s, there was a general understanding that inflation was driven by “guns and butter”; i.e., fiscal deficits and the increase to the money supply, both partially driven by the Vietnam War, led to increased inflation, which went over 10%.

The deficits today are even larger and occurring in boom times — not as the result of a recession — and they have been supported by quantitative easing, which was never done before the great financial crisis.

Quantitative easing is a form of increasing the money supply (though it has many offsets). I remain more concerned about quantitative easing than most, and its reversal, which has never been done before at this scale.

Equity values, by most measures, are at the high end of the valuation range, and credit spreads are extremely tight.These markets seem to be pricing in at a 70% to 80% chance of a soft landing— modest growth along with declining inflation and interest rates.

""I believe the odds are a lot lower than that,"" Dimon warns.

In the meantime, there seems to be an enormous focus, too much so, on monthly inflation data and modest changes to interest rates. But the die may be cast — interest rates looking out a year or two may be predetermined by all of the factors I mentioned above. Small changes in interest rates today may have less impact on inflation in the future than many people believe.

Therefore, we are prepared for a very broad range of interest rates, from 2% to 8% or even more,with equally wide-ranging economic outcomes — from strong economic growth with moderate inflation (in this case, higher interest rates would result from higher demand for capital) to a recession with inflation; i.e., stagflation.

Economically, the worst-case scenario would be stagflation, which would not only come with higher interest rates but also with higher credit losses, lower business volumes and more difficult markets.

Under these many different scenarios, our company would continue to perform at least okay.

While we do not know the full effect or the precise rate at which AI will change our business - or how it will affect society at large - we are completelyconvinced the consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformationalas some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years:

Think the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the Internet, among others.

Over time, we anticipate that our use ofAI has the potential to augment virtually every job, as well as impact our workforce composition.

It may reduce certain job categories or roles, but it may create others as well.

The mini banking crisis of 2023 is over, but beware of higher rates and recession — not just for banks but for the whole economy.

Dimon previously explained that thatthe crisis was over provided that interest rates didn’t go up dramatically and we didn’t experience a serious recession.

If long-end rates go up over 6% and this increase is accompanied by a recession, there will be plenty of stress — not just in the banking system but with leveraged companies and others.

Remember, a simple 2 percentage point increase in rates essentially reduced the value of most financial assets by 20%, and certain real estate assets, specifically office real estate, may be worth even less due to the effects of recession and higher vacancies.

Also remember that credit spreads tend to widen, sometimes dramatically, in a recession.

Finally, we should also consider that rates have been extremely low for a long time — it’s hard to know how many investors and companies are truly prepared for a higher rate environment.

""When terrible events happen, we tend to overestimate the effect they will have on the global economy.Recent events, however, may very well be creating risks that could eclipse anything since World War II - we should not take them lightly.""

2024-04-09 06:55:00,"Working From Home ""Here To Stay"": Here's The Best States To Live When You Can Avoid The Office",https://web.archive.org/web/20240409124721/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/working-home-here-stay-heres-best-states-live-when-you-can-avoid-office,"During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies transitioned to a work-from-home model to maintain operations, a practice many have continued,according to WalletHub, who recently studied work from home trends.

From October 2023 to January 2024, over 21% of employees eligible to work remotely did so for five or more days a week, with more than 67% working from home at least once a week. However, not all remote workers find themselves in ideal working conditions, which ideally encompass low expenses, comfort, security, and minimal distractions.

The feasibility of remote work can significantly vary based on one's location. WalletHub's analysis of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, utilizing 12 key metrics, aimed to ascertain the regions offering the most conducive environments for working from home. This evaluation covered a spectrum of factors, including the proportion of the workforce operating remotely, internet affordability, cybersecurity measures, and the size and occupancy rates of homes.

According to Cassandra Happe, a WalletHub analyst, ""Working from home can save people a lot of money on transportation expenses, as well as make their work environment a lot more comfortable and their hours more flexible. However, factors like energy costs, internet speed, home sizes, and household occupancy can significantly impact people's savings and productivity.""

She continued: ""While remote jobs can technically be done from anywhere, certain states offer much better conditions for this work mode.""

Happe highlights New Jersey as the top state for remote work, attributing its ranking to affordable internet and widespread broadband access, alongside a significant portion of the workforce already working from home.

WalletHub's list ranking the best states to work from home showcases a diverse range of locales, from densely populated areas to expansive rural regions, emphasizing factors beyond just geography. Leading the pack isNew Jersey. Following closely areUtah and Delaware.Maryland and the District of Columbiaround out the top five, with the latter standing out for its top-tier internet access despite being ranked last for living space.

Katina Sawyer, Ph.D., an Associate Professor at the University of Arizona, predicts, ""Despite many employers' efforts to bring staff back to the office, the desire among employees for hybrid or flexible work arrangements persists. A complete return to office settings appears unfeasible for organizations contemplating how to reduce physical office spaces.The work-from-home model is here to stay, with companies encouraged to embrace rather than resist this trend.""

Echoing this sentiment, Katrina A. Burch, Ph.D., an Associate Professor and Director at Western Kentucky University, sees an increase in remote work options, which ""will broaden the talent pool for positions and potentially attract top talent. Organizations recognize that remote work and flexible arrangements can enhance employee productivity, engagement, satisfaction, and decrease turnover.""

Jerel E. Slaughter, a Professor at The University of Arizona, outlined the advantages for employees, including time savings from commuting and enhanced concentration leading to increased creativity. However, he notes the challenges in fostering a culture of trust and close personal relationships remotely. Slaughter advocates for hybrid arrangements to balance relationship-building in-office days with productivity-focused remote work.

Raymond J. Keating, Chief Economist at the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, noted the productivity gains and work-life balance improvements for remote employees but cautions about potential impacts on career advancement due to reduced personal connections. For employers, Keating emphasizes the advantages in talent retention and the challenges in identifying employees suited for remote work.

2024-04-09 07:20:00,Traders' Doubts Fed Can Hit Inflation Goal Underscore CPI Risks,https://web.archive.org/web/20240409124721/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/traders-doubts-fed-can-hit-inflation-goal-underscore-cpi-risks,"By Garfield Reynolds, Bloomberg Markets Live reporter and strategist

The Treasury market is palpably on tenterhooks going into this week’s inflation release, especially after payrolls joined the long list of data releases to come in stronger than expected.Bond traders’ inflation expectations have surged this year to signal doubts the Fed can meet its goal, meaning risks are tilted to the upside for yields going into Wednesday’s CPI release.

While the pace of consumer-price gains is expected to ease, even the most optimistic economist forecast still sees headline annual inflation above 3%. Surging oil and other commodity prices aren’t helping, and the same goes for supply disruptions that threaten to undo the goods disinflation that has helped cool costs in the economy.

That helps explain why two-year breakeven rates have climbed to ~30bps under Feb. CPI. If average inflation does come in at the 2.85% or so now envisaged by TIPS then it’s possible the Fed doesn’t reach its target in that time frame. That casts doubt on the capacity of policymakers to deliver on their projected six rate cuts through the end of next year.

2024-04-09 07:45:00,US Small-Business Optimism Slides To 11-Year Low As Bidenomics Fails,https://web.archive.org/web/20240409124721/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/us-small-business-optimism-slides-11-year-low-bidenomics-fails#comment-stream,"The failure of Bidenomics has crushed confidence among US small businesses to the lowest level in more than a decade, as the future path of inflation remains a significant concern. Readers must remember small businesses are vital to the economy, contributing 44% of the country's economic activity and creating two-thirds of net new jobs.

The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) reported Tuesday that its small-business optimism index declined .9 points to 88.5, the lowest level since the second half of 2012 - or about when the US economy climbed out of the worst financial crisis ever.

Twenty-five percent of business owners identified inflation as the largest issue plaguing day-to-day operations, highlighting the impact of increased costs for inputs and labor. This represents a 2-point increase from February. Additionally, the proportion of businesses that have increased their average selling prices went up by 7 points compared to the previous month.

""Owners continue to manage numerous economic headwinds,"" Bill Dunkelberg, the group's chief economist, wrote in a statement, as quoted by Bloomberg.

Dunkelberg said, ""Inflation has once again been reported as the top business problem on Main Street and the labor market has only eased slightly.""

The worsening sentiment among small business owners directly correlates to the rise in consumer prices in the first two months of the year:

Rising gasoline prices at the pump, inching closer to thepolitically sensitive level of $4 a gallon, have likely also contributed to the souring mood.

Last week, the NFIB reported that small businesses' hiring plans in March were the shockingly weakest since May 2020. This report is a major concern, considering small firms are the economic engine of the economy.

The gloom among small business owners is an ominous sign that the US economy is on shaky ground while the federal government recklessly spends to avert a recession before the November elections.

2024-04-09 08:10:54,Futures Flat In Cautious Trade Ahead Of CPI As Gold Roars To New Record High,https://web.archive.org/web/20240409124721/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/futures-flat-cautious-trade-ahead-cpi-gold-roars-new-erecord-high,"US equity futures are trading in a narrow range, swinging between gains and losses as bonds climbed, clawing back some of Monday’s slump which sent yields to the highest since last November in the buildup to US CPI print tomorrow that is crucial to the Fed's decision when it will start to cut interest rates; Government debt in the UK and Germany followed suit, with yields falling across the curve after a 20-year UK bond sale drew record demand from investors. As of 8:00am, S&P futures were up 0.1% but traded tightly around the unchanged line as they extended Monday’s flat close on Wall Street, when trading was the thinnest since Christmas. Nasdaq futures gained 0.2% while Europe's Estoxx 50 was down about 0.5%, with technology and industrials leading to the downside. Commodity markets are higher lead by Energy and Metals, with Gold hitting a new record high, rising as much as $25 to $2,365 before paring gains. The macro picture is light today but keep an eye on the 3Y auction, which may give some cues to investor positioning ahead of the CPI.

In premarket trading, Mag7 names are mixed with Semis up. Blackberry rose 6.9% after the Canadian software company announced a robotics collaboration with AMD. Here are some other notable premarket movers:

Caution dominates sentiment before Wednesday’s inflation report, which is forecast to show some further easing of price pressures but may surprise to the upside after the recent surge in oil prices. Traders are also preparing for the ECB's rates announcement on Thursday, which could support bets on earlier easing by the ECB than the Fed, and for the start of the first-quarter earnings season. While markets now favor just two US rate cuts this year,former Fed St. Louis President James Bullard said three reductions remain “the base case.""

For Mohit Kumar, strategist and chief economist for Europe at Jefferies, the more important discussion should be over how the Fed would respond to any signs that resilience in the American economy is faltering.""The right question is whether the Fed is willing to cut rates if there is any sign of weakness,”Kumar wrote in a note to clients. “And on that we are reasonably confident that if the economy weakens, we will see easing from the Fed which would support risk sentiment.”

While economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the consumer price index will show some cooling in inflation, the core gauge, which excludes food and energy costs, is forecast to be up 3.7% from a year earlier — above the Fed’s 2% target. Concerns, however, are for hotter prints in the future, which reflect the ongoing surge in gold, which rose as much as $25 to $2,365 this morning, a new record high, and up more 17% since mid-February. Copper traded near a 15-month high as supply tightens and global manufacturing picks up.

Marija Veitmane, head of equity markets research at State Street Global, said her firm’s measure of online inflation pointed to a potentially above-consensus read.“We have seen prices in every sector we track to grow at higher than average pace in March,” she said. As for corporate results, “we continue to worry about narrowness of earnings, where majority of growth comes from the tech/large-cap stocks, which majority of companies are showing signs of stress,” Veitmane said. “Falling margins are particular concerns as they tend to precede layoffs.”

European stocks fall with consumer products, construction and real estate underperforming. FTSE 100 outperforms peers, adding 0.2%, DAX lags, dropping 0.6%.  In individual stock moves Tuesday, BP Plc rose to a five-month high after an update that analysts said showed a strong performance in oil and gas trading. Renault SA advanced after an upgrade from analysts at Barclays Plc. Mining stocks were a bright spot in Europe as iron ore headed for its biggest two-day rally in more than two years.

Earlier in the session, Asian stocks climbed for a second day, as TSMC helped drive gains in tech shares on investor excitement over its US production plans. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.7%, with TSMC the biggest boost after the US announced an agreement for $11.6 billion in grants and loans to help the chipmaker build factories. Taiwan led gains across the region, with its benchmark index gaining as much as 1.9% to a record high. Stocks also advanced in Hong Kong, Japan and Australia.

In FX, the Bloomberg dollar spot index is flat, while NOK and SEK outperform, and JPY and DKK lag G-10 FX. The yen hovered near a 34-year low and around the closely watched 152 level that many say will trigger Japanese authorities to act.

In rates, treasuries rise, paring some of Monday’s losses that saw 10-year yields climb to the highest since November. Bunds, gilts follow suit as yields across the curve drop; treasuries are richer across the curve by at least 2bp, tracking bigger gains in core European rates.Treasury 10-year yields around 4.39% are down by more than 3bp on the day,but trail bunds and gilts in the sector by ~1.5bp as curve spreads remain within about 1bp of Monday’s closing levels. Gilt and bund futures remain near best levels of the dayafter UK 20-year bond sale drew record demand from investors.Asia session flows included two 2s10s block flatteners for a combined $650k/DV01 in cash risk. US session highlights include $58 billion 3-year note auction, first of three coupon sales this week. Coupon auction cycle begins at 1pm New York time with $58b 3-year note; $39b 10-year note and $22b 30-year bond reopenings follow Wednesday and Thursday. WI 3-year yield at roughly 4.565% is ~31bp cheaper than last month’s, which stopped 1.3bp through on strong demand.

In commodities, oil traded near a five-month high as investors weighed simmering tensions in the Middle East and persistent supply concerns. Israel said progress has been made in negotiations for a cease-fire in Gaza, signaling a potential easing of hostilities, but Hamas denied the claim. WTI traded within Monday’s range, adding 0.5% to trade around $86; meanwhile base metals are mixed; LME aluminum falls 0.5% while LME tin gains 2%. Spot gold held a record high, rising roughly $20 to trade near $2,359/oz, and up more 17% since mid-February. Copper traded near a 15-month high as supply tightens and global manufacturing picks up.

Looking at today's calendar, there is no US economic data or Fed speakers scheduled for the session

APAC stocks traded mostly higher but with price action relatively rangebound with global markets lacking any major catalysts ahead of upcoming risk events.ASX 200 was led by miners but with gains capped after weak consumer sentiment and a mixed business survey. Nikkei 225 continued to benefit from recent currency weakness with USD/JPY lying in wait for a retest of 152.00. Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp. were varied with the Hong Kong benchmark lifted although the psychologically key 17,000 level continued to elude. Conversely, the mainland lagged after another tepid PBoC liquidity operation, while Premier Li recently noted uncertainty and complexity in the external environment are rising.

European bourses in the red, Stoxx 600 -0.2%, action is subdued across the board but with some mild divergence in catalysts thin trade.DAX 40 -0.6% the relatively underperformer pressured by heavyweights SAP & Daimler Trucks and despite support in Infineon from TSMC; defence names, including Germany's Rheinmetall, pressured after commentary from GS on defence valuations and earlier geopolitical reports around necessary export licenses. Sectors more broadly do not have any overarching bias/theme, with relative outperformance in Basic Resources and Energy names echoing underlying benchmarks and helping the FTSE 100 +0.1% tread water. Stateside, futures near the unchanged mark (ES +0.1%, NQ +0.1%) with catalysts light thus far and the docket ahead sparse before Wednesday's CPI & Minutes; Tesla -0.3% in focus after a fatal crash lawsuit settled and given the latest CPCA numbers.

Geopolitics: Middle East

DB's Henry Allen concludes the overnight wrap

Markets got the week off to a subdued start yesterday, with little in the way of fresh developments to drive any new moves. That should change later in the week, as we’ll get the US CPI report, the ECB’s policy decision, and the start of the Q1 earnings season. But for now at least, the main theme has been the continuation of last week’s trends, including more and more doubts about rate cuts this year, and growing fears about inflation. Indeed, the US 5yr inflation swap (+1.0bps) hit 2.57% by yesterday’s close, marking its highest level since October.

Those questions about rate cuts have been clear from market pricing. For instance, the probability of a cut by the Fed’s June meeting was down to just 52% by the close yesterday, where it remains this morning. That’s the lowest since October, back when the 10yr Treasury yield was trading near 5% and there was growing belief in the “higher for longer” narrative when it came to rates. In addition, the total number of cuts priced for 2024 also fell, with just 61.5bps of cuts priced by the Fed’s December meeting, down -3.3bps on the previous day. And it’s clear that trend is happening globally as well, with overnight index swaps taking the chance of an ECB cut by June down from 97% to 91%, and this morning that’s fallen further to 88%. Moreover, the ECB cuts priced by December came down -4.8bps to 84bps, with a further decline overnight to just 80.5bps, which is the fewest so far this year.

With investors pricing in in fewer rate cuts, that’s helped to drive a bond selloff on both sides of the Atlantic. I n the US, it saw the 2yr Treasury yield rise +3.9bps to 4.79%, while the 10yr yield was up +1.8bps to 4.42%, the highest closing levels of 2024 so far for both. At one point intraday, the 10yr yield even moved as high as 4.46%, before coming back down again into the close. Both the 10yr real yield and 10yr breakeven reached year-to-date highs. And over in Europe, there was a similar bond selloff, with yields on 10yr bunds (+3.7bps), OATs (+1.7bps) and BTPs (+1.1bps) all moving higher.

Looking forward, the focus is now on tomorrow’s US CPI report for March, but yesterday’s Fedspeak offered little guidance on the timing of any rate cuts. Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, who’s a more dovish member, noted that if rates stayed high, then “the unemployment rate is going to start going up”. Separately, Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari said that the labour was still tight, although his base case was that inflation would continue to fall.

Earlier in the day, we also had the New York Fed’s latest Survey of Consumer Expectations, but it showed a mixed picture on inflation expectations. The good news was that 5yr expectations fell by three-tenths to +2.6%, but 1yr expectations were constant at +3.0%, and the 3yr measure ticked up again to a four-month high of +2.9%. So no obvious headline on the inflation side. But there were some more negative trends on the labour market, which showed consumers were becoming distinctly less confident. For example, the mean probability of losing one’s job rose to 15.7%, which is the highest it’s been in three-and-a-half years. And the mean probability of finding another job in the next three months if their current job was lost fell to 51.2%, the lowest in almost three years.

When it came to equities, there were signs that the volatility at the end of last week was beginning to subside, with the S&P 500 (-0.04%) seeing little change and the VIX coming down by -0.8pts. Small-cap stocks were an outperformer, with the Russell 2000 up +0.50%. Energy stocks underperformed within the S&P 500 (-0.63%), as oil prices saw a moderate retreat from five-month highs at the end of last week (Brent crude -0.87% to $90.38/bbl). The Magnificent 7 saw a slight outperformance (+0.27%) thanks to a +4.90% gain for Tesla following news late last week that it plans to unveil a robotaxi in August.

Over in Europe, the STOXX 600 (+0.47%) posted its strongest start to a week since February, whilst there were solid gains for the DAX (+0.79%) and the CAC 40 (+0.72%) as well. That strength was evident among other risk assets too, and yesterday saw US HY spreads (-5bps) and EUR HY spreads (-4bps) both tighten. Meanwhile, with the Q1 earnings season coming up, our colleagues in Credit Strategy have sketched their expectations for EUR IG. Although spreads have already tightened a lot since the autumn, they believe earnings should still prove supportive for spreads. See their full report here.

Overnight in Asia, the subdued tone has continued, and there’s been a mixed performance for equities across the region. That includes gains for the Nikkei (+0.86%) and the Hang Seng (+0.55%), alongside modest declines for the KOSPI (-0.12%), the Shanghai Comp (-0.15%) and the CSI 300 (-0.25%). In the meantime, there’ve been fresh losses for Japanese sovereign bonds, and the 2yr yield (+1.2bps) is up to 0.23% this morning, marking its highest level since 2011. That comes amidst comments from BoJ Governor Ueda overnight, who said that he expects Japan’s price trend to increase toward the end of the BoJ’s projection period. Looking forward, US equity futures remain broadly flat, with those on the S&P 500 up just +0.06%. And for US Treasuries there’s been a slight recovery this morning, with the 10yr yield down -1.0bps to 4.41%.

Finally, it’s a quiet day ahead on the calendar, but we will get the ECB’s Bank Lending Survey, and in the US there’s the NFIB’s small business optimism index for March.

2024-04-09 08:25:00,"In The Next Several Weeks, We Could See $300 Billion Of Liquidity Leaving The System",https://web.archive.org/web/20240409124721/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/next-several-weeks-we-could-see-300-billion-liquidity-leaving-system,"Submitted by Larry McDonald, creator of theBear Traps Reportand author of the newly published book""When Markets Speak""which has been #1 on Amazon over the last week across most non-fiction, finance categories.

What’s Under the Surface?

The heart of “conditioning bias” comes down to one sentence. The longer something works, the more players get drawn into playing the game. We know the junkies are on every street corner these days buying call options when theVIX is up 29% since late December with equities as measured by the S&P 500 – up just a touch more than 9% higher.

Over the last 30 years — most of the time, the CBOE Volatility Index has been supported by investors looking for downside protection in buying puts. But 2024 is much like 1999. For most of that year, the same thing occurred.Today, many players on the field say “greed is good” and they’re all buying upside.

They Love to Buy the 20 Day Moving Average

As the market grinds higher – more and more capital came into the hands of algos and quants buying the 20-day moving average. This is an important area to keep an eye on. There are so many players involved, that a violation of the 20-day moving average will likely come with a meaningful flush lower.

What Could Alter the Equation?

In the next several weeks, we could see about $300 billion of liquidity leaving the system. This is in large part due to the tax deadline on April 15(see""$265 Billion In Capital Gains Tax Selling: Morgan Stanley Warns Momentum Mauling Is Coming, Thanks To The IRS""). We should expect large tax revenues, in part because taxpayers have significant capital gains from the 2023 equity bull run. Treasury bill issuance will flip negative in Q2 to the tune of about $150 billion as the government runs a budget surplus for a cup of coffee. Add to that the $95 billion in monthly QT (quantitative tightening, Fed balance sheet reduction) and we could see $250 billion of liquidity drain. On top of that, this month about $75 billion of the emergency bank lending facility (BTFP loans) expired and since the facility is now closed, they may not get renewed.This causes another contraction in bank reserves.

Keep in mind, that S&P 500 companies are still in the buyback blackout period, which means that they cannot buy back their stock until they have reported earnings. Stock buybacks are about $100BN per month, so this upward pressure on stocks is currently gone.

Equity Volatility is Cheap vs. Encroaching Risks

The combination of the cocktail ingredients listed above makes the market very vulnerable and at risk of a larger drawdown if any geopolitical risk comes to the surface. Each week, Iran and Israel look toward retaliation, and the probability of escalation is rising. Brent is up nearly 30% since December, putting significant pressure on higher bond yields. Over the same period, the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasuries has moved from 378bps (3.78%) to 440bps (4.40%).

One of the biggest drivers of the stock market since early 2023, and especially since late October, has beenliquidity.In an election year of course, Treasury Secretary Yellen and Fed Chair Powell have carefully rebuilt a big chunk of the excess liquidity that underpinned the stock market rally. The two main reasons for the liquidity boost have been to — a) stabilize the banking system after SVB (Silicon Valley Bank) blew up a year ago and — b) to suppress volatility in the election year. A large amount of that liquidity has come from the Reverse Repo Facility (RRP). This is a facility the Fed brought to life in 2020 to mop up some of the excess liquidity from all the Fed’s juicy new programs used to stabilize the financial system during the Covid Financial Panic.

Pick up our latest book“When Markets Speak“which has been #1 on Amazon over the last week across most non-fiction, finance categories.

Remember, the Fed injected $3.3T of liquidity into the system that year. Fast forward to the end of 2022, and there was almost $2.5T in this RRP facility. Ever since, Treasury Secretary Yellen has been using this money in this honey pot, the RRP to finance her ~$2.5T of bill issuance.The way this works is that when the Treasury ramps up bill issuance, it will push up bill yields.At some point that yield we go above the rate on these reserve balances in the RRP. This is what the Fed pays investors, mostly money market funds, to keep money in the RRP. These investors get lured into the bills market with its higher rates and they take their money out of the RRP and buy bills with it. The money in the RRP is not considered to be part of overall liquidity, so if that money leaves the RRP and enters the bills market, it adds to the liquidity pool. Much of this money has ended up in a special component of the commercial banks’ balance sheet called the reserve balance held at the Fed. In the past, the Fed injected liquidity into the system via QE, which also increased these reserves. But in the last year, the bank reserves expanded primarily from the RRP depletion, and the Fed’s introduction of the Bank Term Funding Program in March of last year. This program allowed banks to borrow from the Fed and use their bonds at par as collateral. This was done to inject liquidity into the banking system to avoid a cash shortage at mainly regional banks following the blow-up of SVB.

Excess Liquidity, Bitcoin, and the S&P

Excess liquidity have surged higher in the last year, which has pushed up risk assets, such as bitcoin and equities.

Together with the introduction of the BTFP in March ’23, the Fed and Treasury pushed up bank reserves from $3T on Oct 22, to $3.6T by March ’24.What do these reserves do?These reserves cannot leave the banking system and therefore cannot enter the “real economy”. It’s a financial form of money only for banks. They can transact in reserves with each other and settle repo and reverse repo transactions. They account for high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) together with bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Most importantly, banks use the reserves to buy bonds from each other. In this way, they drive liquidity into the market and drive investors into riskier assets.We see that almost every time reserves go up, risk assets benefit.

Bank Reserves Go Up when RRP Goes Down and Vice Versa

As the Treasury pushed money out of the RRP, bank reserves held at the Fed have gone up simultaneously. This has been one of the biggest driver of stock market gains

In the next few weeks, we could see liquidity reverse for two reasons.

Overall we could see over $300bl of contraction if Yellen/Powell do not step in to offset. We think they will step in but it might take a month or so for them to react.

In the meantime, we are still in the buyback blackout window ($100bl of monthly buybacks do not start anew until after GOOG/AAPL report in late April/Early May) so we could fly into an air pocket.

In the next blog post, we will explain how Yellen and Powell can and will come up with a solution if they see liquidity plunge too far or stock market volatility surges higher.

2024-04-09 08:45:00,Dollar Tree Shoppers Revolt Over $7 Items,https://web.archive.org/web/20240409124721/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/dollar-tree-shoppers-revolt-over-7-items#comment-stream,"Discount retailer Dollar Tree has sparked a revolt among some of its customers after increasing the price cap of items to $7 across thousands of stores nationwide.

""If it were really going to go up like $7 … that'd be too much. I'd rather just get everything at Walmart,""Scott Kolack, a Dollar Tree regular, toldWPTV-TV(West Palm Beach).

On March 13, Dollar Tree CEO Rick Dreiling told investors during a conference call, ""This year, across 3,000 stores, we expect to expand our multi-price assortment by over 300 items at price points ranging from $1.50 to $7.""

Dreiling said the higher costs would include food, pet, and personal care items, though not all items will reach the $7 mark.

""Over time, you will also see us fully integrate multi-price merchandise more into our stores so our shoppers will find $5 bags of dog food next to our traditional $1.25 pet treats and toys, and our $3 bags of candy will be found in the candy aisle,"" Dreiling said.

Dollar Tree's CEO also pointed out that the company's fastest-growing demographic is consumers making around $125k a year. This comes as Bidenomics fails what's left of the middle class.

There really is something amiss with the economy when budget retailers can no longer supply customers with low-cost items.

Last Friday, hundreds of 99 Cents Only storesabruptly closed, and the company was forced into liquidation due to ""rising levels of shrink, persistent inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic headwinds.""

Here's what X users are saying about Dollar Tree's new $7 price cap:

What is happening? Dollar Tree is now $7 Tree and now this.Inflation is radically transforming the world we live in, faster than I’ve ever seen before.https://t.co/6lPS6lrDiQ

STORE CLOSINGSAll 99 Cents Only — 300+ stores across the nation — are closing for good.Dollar Tree is closing nearly 1,000 Family Dollar stores, citing theft & inflation.Economists say this trend of bargain store closures is troubling.This is Joe Biden’s economy.

🚨🚨BREAKING🚨🚨Dollar Tree to officially change the name to Inflation Tree

""Dollar Tree"" already had to become the ""Five Dollar Tree"" this year. No way these niche stores will last much longer in this#inflation. Now we'll have even MORE unemployed on the streets across America.The Dems are getting their way... They are so close to destroying us.

It may be time for Dollar Tree to change its name.

*Source and IMF Paper to which Pozsar refers above both at bottom

Yesterday Secretary Yellen said the following as her trip to China wrapped up:

After wrapping up my meetings, I capped off a productive trip with a visit to the Imperial College, and a microbrewery in Beijing that imports American hops for their beers — a small representation of how the U.S.-China bilateral economic relationship can benefit both sides.

The implications of such a statement (if that’s the best we can hope for from our leaders as Gold soars, treasuries drop and industry flounders) are the following….

This is Reverse Economic Colonization... aka the circle of life. It was bound to happen as it always does to degrees. But this one is a wholesale reset of money, roles, and power sharing

It is Happening. And it's your future if you do not adjust and prepare. The wealthy have already carved out their roles and will survive just fine

Take care of yourself now.

1- Avoid financial repression with proper financial hedges appropriate for a changing economy, money, and power (mercantilism).

2- Prepare your children for career path changes. - manufacturing, chips, cyber, import/export trade, added value materials.What’s old is new again

3- Expect 1 out of 3 ""affluent"" pals to leave nothing to their children in 20 years from resource depletion due to not doing #1

One of the last major, and most strident, institutes of higher learning holdouts clinging to pseudoscientific and immoral COVID-19 vaccine mandates, Rutgers University, recently unexpectedly halted its requirements for students.

Pending litigationagainst Rutgers by Children’s Health Defense continues unabated: “We are planning to appeal further to the U.S. Supreme Court, continuing to press our position that Rutgers never had the power to do what it did,” per lead attorney in the suit, Julio C. Gomez.

In anemail obtained by Children’s Health Defenseand distributed by the administration to all faculty, staff, and students, the university made the following claims before noting it has decided to drop COVID-19 vaxx requirements despite emphasizing that “ALL other vaccine requirements will remain in effect” for students:

“Since March 2020 we have relied on science, includingguidance fromour own experts andfrom the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention*, on how best to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.Your cooperation hasbeen unfailing andled to a successful effort in keeping our community safe**.”

*This is how institutions like Rutgers have been allowed to get away with enforcing pseudoscientific COVID policies throughout the pandemic: hiding behind the “guidelines” from the CDC. It’s also how the Public Health™ appendages of the federal government have been able to enforce their will yet retain plausible deniability that they themselves ever created or enforced any mandates; they simply released “guidelines” that Rutgers and other institutions reflectively followed, with implications of revoked federal funding or other consequences for non-compliance. It’s a shell game of deferred responsibility.

**On the substantive merit of mandates, the so-called “vaccines,” we now have the data to prove, did no such thing as “led to a successful effort in keeping our community safe,” as Rutgers claims — a claim, by the way, likely designed to indemnify itself against legal responsibility in the pending CHD lawsuit.

It is public record, and has for years at this point, that, in addition to the “vaccines” not stopping transmission,Pfizer never even tested in its clinical trials to determine whether they prevented transmission.The pharmaceutical industry simply dispatched the dutiful corporate state media stenographers who rely on its advertising bucks, and politicians who rely on their campaign bucks, tosaythey prevent transmission, thereby granting carte blanche to workplaces, schools, and local governments to enforce unjustifiable mandates.

Related:BOMBSHELL: Pfizer, Fauci, Biden Lied About Vaxx Transmission Data

Anyone who challenged the transmission narrative, by the way, as I did from the start of their rollout, got their social media accounts permanently suspended.

What all of this boils down to is that there is not now and never was any legitimate public health rationale for COVID-19 vaccine mandates, and any institution like Rutgers that exercised even a modicum of due diligence would have known this from the start.

Accordingly, all of the students who got the shot and suffered lifelong injuries or died, as well as those who refused and were expelled or denied admission, are owed reparations.

Wake Up NJ hosted a X Spaceslast night featuringNo College Mandatesand students impacted by the mandates.

One of the main takeaways for me were the life-changing impacts on a personal level that these draconian edicts inflicted on students; it occurred to me, while listening, that, had I been a student at Rutgers or anywhere with a mandate in the COVID era, I may never have graduated from college. We may never know fully how many lives were destroyed over the last several years, but the evidence of the devastation will only mount moving forward.

""You've probably read about the fact that we're selling one-ounce gold bars. We sold over $100 million of gold during the quarter,"" sad CFO Richard Galenti.

Now, Wells Fargo estimates thatCostco ""may now be running at"" $100 million to $200 millionper monthin gold sales.

""Our work suggeststhere has been significant interest given COST’s aggressive pricingand high level of customer trust,"" said analyst Edward Kelly in a Tuesday note to clients. ""The accelerating frequency of Reddit posts, quick on-line sell-outs of product, and COST’s robust monthly eComm salessuggests a sharp uptick in momentum since the launch,""CNBCreports.

Costco is selling one-ounce bars made of nearly pure 24-karat gold. While the price is not disclosed online to nonmembers,it’s estimated that the product generally sells for about 2% above the spot price, which as of Tuesday morning was around $2,357 an ounce. That would put the price at Costco just over $2,400.

Sales of Costco gold bars are now limited tofive per customer(up from two), while executive members receive 2% back. Those who use their Citigroup credit cards will receive a further 2%.

""Pricing at that level and shipping costs suggests it’s a very low profit business at best,"" wrote Kelly.

Spot prices for gold have notably been on a tear this year, rising over 13% YTD amid persistent inflation, nearly $35 trillion in national debt (and growing), and investor fears over the state of the 'deteriorating US fiscal situation,' according to the report.

According to DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas, ""The move suggests that many foreign governments feel the need to hedge geopolitical outcomes that might be negative catalysts for other risk assets like stocks.""

""The only good news is that this reinforces the idea of gold as a reasonable hedge for diversified portfolios,"" he added.

2024-04-09 18:00:00,"Scandal Rocks Biden's Labor Dept For Lying About Sharing Non-Public Inflation Data With Secret Group Of Wall Street ""Super Users""",https://web.archive.org/web/20240410122026/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/scandal-rocks-bidens-labor-dept-lying-about-sharing-non-public-inflation-data-secret-group,"A little over a month ago, a scandal erupted among the (relatively small( group of economists who keep a close eye on the monthly inflation data reported by the Biden Department of Labor, when they learned that there is an even smaller, and much more exclusive group of economists called ""super users"" who get preferential treatment from the BLS, includingwink-wink-nudge-nudgeexplanations of where the data may diverge from expectations. That was the case for the January CPI when as Bloomberg first reported, the BLS sent an email to a group of data “super users”, which ""explained suggested a surge in a measure of rental inflation — which left analysts puzzled — was caused by an adjustment to how subcomponents of the index are weighted"":

Once it became public knowledge that there was a super secret group of preferential ""accounts"" receiving economic data, immediately following the Bloomberg report, a recipient of the email said that BLS Statistics""tried to retract it and that they were told to disregard its contents.""Almost as if they were trying to hide it after the fact.

In retrospect, it appears the BLS really did have something to hide, because in a follow up from both the NYT and Bloomberg, we now learn that an economist from theBureau of Labor Statistics was corresponding on data related the monthly CPI print with major firms like JPMorgan and BlackRock, in what Bloombergsaid""raised questions about equitable access to economic information.""

Extending on the report from February, records requested by Bloomberg revealed that the unnamed BLS economist answered numerous inquiries about details within the CPI in recent months, mostly related to computations in key categories within shelter as well as used cars, according to

The back and forth between the financial firms and the economist ""who has been with the BLS for many years"" was first reported by the New York Times;  as discussed previously, the government bureaucrat sent several emails to a broader group, which he called “my super users” in one of the emails obtained by Bloomberg. The BLS previously lied when it said it doesn’t maintain a list of “super users.”

In mid-February, one user asked if they could be added to the “super user email list,” to which the BLS economist replied minutes later, “Yes I can add you to the list.” The move was an attempt by the lowly paid government worker to curry favor with his much better paid peers on the sell- and buyside so that he could, one day, trade the preferential data access for a cushier job in some hedge fund or Wall Street firm.

As Bloomberg details, while the recipients’ names were redacted from the request, email signature details or disclosures from their employers were visible in some of the provided records. And inaddition to BlackRock and JPMorgan,other banks, hedge funds and research firms —Brevan Howard, Millennium Capital Partners LLP, Citadel, Moore Capital Management, High Frequency Economics, Nomura Securities International and BNPParibas — appeared in the exchanges and declined to comment.Pharo Management and Wolfe Researchalso came up in the emails but didn’t provide comment.

Understandably, economists - at least those who were not important enough to be on the ""super user"" list - have been clamoring to find out more about these “super users” are after the BLS staffer addressed an email to those people in February, suggesting that a change to the weights of underlying data within a key measure of rental inflation was behind its surge in January’s CPI. As we reported at the time, the BLS told recipients to disregard its contents, and subsequently tried to clear the confusion with a notice on its website. The agency also said that the email was “a mistake.”

But, as noted above, we now know that this was merely the latest lie by a Biden agency; and so this latest revelation ""is likely to prompt a deeper look at the dissemination of economic information that has implications for how major assets trade as well as Federal Reserve policy.""

The BLS encourages people to ask questions and makes its staff available to engage with the public,but they strive to create equal access to information for everyone,said Emily Liddel, associate commissioner for publications and special studies at the BLS. Clearly, granting access only to Wall Street giants is not quite the equitable treatment the agency's woke DEI staffers envisioned.

“Obviously this has been an embarrassment for the agency,”Liddel said.“The public puts a lot of trust in us to be fair, and our data providers put a lot of trust in us for the data to be secure. It’s our goal to repair that trust.”

And while the BLS economist often pointed users to relevant links on the agency’s website, at least one case, he shared information that wasn’t publicly available at the time, related to the calculation for the used cars index within the CPI.Liddel said it is “still under review” whether the employee shared other nonpublic information, and that the issues appear to be isolated to this one staffer. He is not answering incoming user questions at this time, she said.

While it remains unclear who the economist is, the NYT reported that emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request show that the agency —or at least the economist who sent the original email, a longtime but relatively low-ranking employee— was in regular communication with data users in the finance industry, apparently including analysts at major hedge funds. And they suggest that there was a list of super users, contrary to the agency’s denials.

At the time, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the email had been an isolated “mistake” and denied that it maintained a list of users who received special access to information.

And while there is no evidence (yet) that the employee providedearly accessto coming statistical releases or directly shared other data that wasn’t available to the public, in several instances,the employee did engage in extended, one-on-one email exchanges with data users about how the inflation figures are put together.Such details, though highly technical, can be of significant interest to forecasters, who compete to predict inflation figures to hundredths of a percentage point. Those estimates, in turn, are used by investors making bets on the huge batches of securities that are tied to inflation or interest rates.

Analysts regularly interact with government economists to make sure that they understand the data, but “when such access can move markets, the process for that access needs to be transparent,” said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project in Washington. “This stuff is so valuable, and then someone just emails it out.”

In at least one case, emails to super users appear to have shared methodological details that were not yet public. On Jan. 31, the employee sent an email to his super users describing coming changes to the way the agency calculates used car prices, at the time a crucial issue for inflation watchers. The email included a three-page document providing detailed answers to questions about the change, and a spreadsheet showing how they would affect calculations.

“Thank you all for your very difficult, challenging and thoughtful questions,” the email said. “It is your questions that help us flesh out all the potential problems.”

The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the change in a news release in early January,but did not publish details about it on its website until mid-February, two weeks after the email from the employee.

It isn’t clear when the employee began providing information to super users, or whether he was the only economist at the agency to do so. Several of his emails were also sent to an internal Bureau of Labor Statistics email alias, suggesting that he did not believe his actions to be inappropriate... or he was simply an idiot.

The super users issue came to light in February, when the employee emailed the group saying that he had identified a technical change that explained an unexpected divergence between rental and homeownership costs in a recent data release. “All of you searching for the source of the divergence have found it,”he wrote.

About an hour and a half after that email went out, a follow-up told recipients to disregard it. In a subsequent online presentation, Bureau of Labor Statistics economists presented evidence that the change identified in the employee’s email was not, in fact, the source of the divergence.

2024-04-10 02:00:00,"Migrant Crime Explodes Higher In Germany In 2023, Violent Crime Hits Record Levels",https://web.archive.org/web/20240410122026/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/migrant-crime-explodes-higher-germany-2023-violent-crime-hits-record-levels,"Authored by John Cody via ReMix News,

The number of foreign suspects soared to around 923,000 last year, representing a massive 18 percent increase in just one year nationwide,according to crime statistics from the German Interior Ministry released on Tuesday.

However, the even more shocking number may have to do with violent crimes, which soared to record levels in 2023.

The data from the interior ministry shows that 41 percent of all crime suspects are foreigners,with 2.246 million people in the country suspected of a crime in 2023, which is 7.3 percent more than in 2022,reports Die Welt,

Overall,foreigners only represent 15 percent of the population.

The shocking numbers have hit Germany like a thunderclap and could have a number of political implications.

The head of the German Police Union, Rainer Wendt, slammed Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) after the drastic rise in foreign crime was revealed.

“The Federal Minister of the Interior is becoming more and more like ‘Nancy in Wonderland’ when she is astonished to discover that Germany has become more violent,”Wendt told Bild.

He argued that one would only be surprised with this outcome “if one has completely lost contact with the population.”

Faeser, for her part, has labeled “right-wing extremism” the biggest threat to the country,all while allowing violent crime and rape to explode under her tenure, especially from foreign criminals.

The government is nowracing to naturalize millions of foreignersin order to ensure that they are not counted under “foreign” crime but are instead counted as “Germans,” as German crime statistics list anyone who commits a crime as “German” regardless of their migration background as long as they have a German passport.

Critics like to claim that much of the “foreign crime” actually consists of immigration law violations.However, this is not the case. For one, these figures do not include violation of immigration law, which were excluded from the data. When one examines the data, foreigners are vastly overrepresented is in serious crime, especially violent crimes.

In fact, half of all violent crimes in Germany were committed by foreigners.

In 2023, the authorities registered around 214,000 violent crimes, an increase of 8.6 percent, and several records were broken in this area. There was a record number of cases involving dangerous and grievous bodily harm, reaching 154,000 cases, a 6.8 percent increase. At the same time, “intentional simple assault” rose to an all-time high of 434,000 cases, jumping 7.4 percent.

Robberies soared higher by 17 percent to 44,857, which is also considered a violent crime.

Crime soared in other categories as well.For example, residential burglary rose to 77,819 cases, up 18.9 percent, car theft (29,985, up 17.5 percent), shoplifting (426,096, up 23.6 percent) and pickpocketing (109,314, up 11 percent).

A total of around 5.94 million crimes were registered in 2023.

To truly understand this rise in foreign crime, it must also be understood that many of the “German” suspects actually have a migration background and are not ethnic Germans. That is because the statistics count any foreigner who obtains German citizenship as simply “German.”

Second- or third-generation migrants who commit crimes are also simply listed as “German” in the crime statistics.

This is unlike Denmark, for instance, which tracks suspects with a migration background, giving a much clearer picture.

2024-04-10 02:45:00,Grid Bottlenecks On The Way In Europe?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240410122026/https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/grid-bottlenecks-way-europe,"A newanalysisby the energy think tank Ember has found that several countries in Europe could soon face bottlenecks in their national transmission energy grids, asmore solar and wind power will be generated than these networks have capacity for.

As Statista's Anna Fleck shows in the following chart,Spain, France and Poland are just some of the countries that will have energy grids which undershoot their country’s respective 2030 policy targets for wind andsolarcapacity.

Out of the 26 countries studied by Ember in this comparison, 11 will not have enough capacity for the expectedwindand solar build out if the present grid plans are realized.

You will find more infographics atStatista

This pattern is not Europe-wide though:several grid plans were found to be closely aligned to the renewable energy targets and and in four countries they were even more ambitious (Croatia, Denmark, Finland, and the Netherlands).

According to the writers of the report,these latter countries have adopted a “sensible approach that better prepares transmission networks to accommodate potential future step ups in national ambition levels.”

Ember analysts say that the misalignment between grid plans and policy targets is likely due to a time lag between the creation of national policy and the development of grid plans, adding that the current lack in grid plan capacities is due to previous policy targets.

The deficit in capacity is problematic, as the writers of the report explain:

“Since it takes far longer to increase grid capacity than it does to deploy wind and solar projects, grids may not be prepared to meet the scale of future increases.”

This will make it harder to achieve energy policy targets.

The furore over Scotland’s draconian new hate crime law rumbles on, as First Minister Humza Yousaf has now stated that the only people who reported his infamous ‘anti-white’ speech as a potential hate crime are “far right.”

In an interview with the BBC, Yousaf took issue with the ‘hatred’ description of his 2020 speech wherein he complained that every political position in Scotland was held by a white person.

As we previously highlighted, Yousaf’s speech in front of the Scottish Parliament on the 11th of June 2020 was reported to police by those opposed to the new legislation.

The BBC interviewer, Stephen Sackur, noted“interestingly, you too have been reported under the new hate crime legislation,” referring to the “white, white, white,” comments made during the speech.

“Now, Scotland is 96 percent white,” Sackur continued, adding “and there are some very active people, particularly on social media, who are saying Humza Yousaf’s message was essentially racist, it was anti-white.”

“The police aren’t interested, they say it’s nonsense, they’re certainly not going to investigate it, but under the new legislation the police also have to record it as a non-criminal hate incident, how do you feel about that?”Sackur asked.

“The description of those who referenced that speech as hatred, I’ve not seen anybody who has described it in that way who isn’t part of the far-right.”

The furore over Scotland's draconian new hate crime law rumbles on, as First Minister Humza Yousaf has now stated that the only people who reported his infamous 'anti-white' speech as a potential hate crime are ""far right."" Report:https://t.co/N535XYKhKGpic.twitter.com/rsU1aR08yG

So, Yousaf is asserting if you don’t agree that it’s a problem white people hold positions in government in a 96 percent demographically white country then you are “far right,” essentially you are the racist, not him.

As we highlighted earlier, the number of reports police are receiving is on course to outnumber the total of all other offences combined as a result of the disastrous new law.

Calum Steele, the former general secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, told the Telegraph thatofficers “are genuinely embarrassed. They feel that the service and by extension [they] as individual police officers will catch some of the public brunt.”

Under the new legislation, anyone deemed to have been verbally ‘abusive’, in person or online, to a transgender person, including “insulting” them could be hit with a prison sentence of up to seven years.

Private households made up 54 percent of this, with more than 31 million tons of ""fresh mass"" generated by the category every year.

The second largest waste sector (21 percent) was the processing and production of food, while the remaining share came from the primary production sector (5 million tons, 9 percent share of the total), restaurants and food services (over 5 million tons, 9 percent share of the total) and retail and other food distributors (just over 4 million tons, 7 percent share).

National governments are infringing on citizens’ human rights by not doing enough to tackle climate change,the European Court of Human Rights has held in a landmark ruling that could have far-reaching consequences and influence climate policy across the continent.

In a highly-anticipated judgment, the Strasbourg court on Tuesday sided with a group of Swiss pensioners who brought aclaim against their national government for its perceived failure to act sufficiently in reducing carbon emissions, claiming that existing climate policy was violating their human rights.

The members of the KlimaSeniorinnen group, supported by environmental campaign groups such as Greenpeace, argued that elderly citizens are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, citing the fact that excess deaths occur more regularly among the elderly during periods of extreme heat because they are less able to regulate their body temperature.

The group also claimed that heat waves impact the mental well-being of elderly citizens more because they are less able to go outside and withstand the heat, which they argue affects their quality of life.

The association relied on Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the general right to life, and Article 8, which guarantees the right to private and family life.

Domestic governments are obliged to take “reasonable and appropriate measures” to secure these rights, steps members of the KlimaSeniorinnen group claimed the Swiss government had not taken.

The litigation had been appealed by the group up to the top human rights court in Europe after its claim was rejected first by the Federal Administrative Court in Switzerland and then by the Federal Supreme Court, the country’s highest ruling body.

The judgment is the third of three similar cases the court was asked to consider in respect to the correlation between climate change and human rights and sets a precedent that all national courts in Council of Europe member states will be required to adhere to.

It had recently dismissed the other two cases, brought by Portuguese youths and a former French mayor who had claimed their respective national governments had infringed on their human rights by not being ambitious enough with their climate targets.

The move could see governments across Europe required to take even greater measures to press on with reducing carbon emissions and pursuing a green agenda that many citizens believe is being wrongly prioritized and expedited to their own detriment.

Climate activists celebrated the ruling outside the Strasbourg court on Tuesday, accompanied by Swedish climate zealot Greta Thunberg.

“The ECHR verdict will send an important signal worldwide,”said Raphaël Mahaim, a lawyer involved in the case and a Green Party lawmaker in the Swiss parliament.

2024-04-10 06:30:00,Treasury Debt - Pristine Collateral Or A Red Flag,https://web.archive.org/web/20240410122026/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/treasury-debt-pristine-collateral-or-red-flag,"Via Charts and Parts Substack,

Spoiler alert: we have another red flag in the treasury market.

The latest talk is to eliminate treasury holdings from the SLR (Supplemental Liquidity Ratio) calculation, which is used to determine how much banks need to set-aside to help “manage risk”.

The Covid crisis brought about market chaos.To manage the steep and fast decline, The Fed jumped into action and cut rates to zero and birthed QE infinity.  They also eliminated the banks’ reserve requirements.The rule sounds just like it reads: banks no longer had to hold any reserves against deposit liabilities.  We already know there is nothing more permanent than a temporary government program, so this reckless policy still exists today.

We’ll remind our readers that we try to over-simply to make a point.The system and web of rules are extremely complex, especially when it comes to the plumbing of the treasury market.

Another handout occurred last year when we witnessed more bank failures than the 2008 GFC (Great Financial Crisis).  The big accommodative move to save the system was to allow banks to mark their (treasury) bond portfolio at “par” (100%), to avoid taking portfolio losses.  This was timely and convenient, as the TLT (Treasury Bond ETF) lost roughly 30% in 2022.As a result of the 2022 bond market route (worst ever), the system is stuck with a pile of losses on the books.

All these rule changes are meant to help “liquify” the system, thus reduce the odds of a systematic shock of sorts.  But these new rules come at the expense of transparency. We’re never quite sure who is holding what, thus we can lose track of where the land mines reside.

By allowing banks to not “mark-to-market” we lose transparency and more importantly, we lose more price discovery.Because the government buys their own bonds, long ago we lost price discovery of the most important price of all - interest rates: the price of “money”.

For 10-years we saw interest rates manipulated lower as debts and deficits soared ever higher.  This meant that the US (and many other countries) were able to borrow at cheaper and cheaper rates, even as their debts and deficits were ballooning.  We will reiterate a favorite C&P quote from a recent presentation,“This is an amazingly simple divergence (rates lower and debt higher) that defies every rule, concept, and bit of logic in financial markets.”

The new SLR rule change could allow banks to be an endless buyer of treasury debt.

Through that lens, this rule makes a lot of sense.  Especially as treasury issuance is testing the Covid highs even though the emergency is long gone.

Said another way, we supposedly have a strong economy, yet the Treasury is selling/issuing bonds at a rate last seen during the Covid crisis.

How convenient for the banks -- to be able to buy treasuries, take no haircut, and not have to worry about mark-to-market losses.  All just in time, as issuances are taking on a life of their own.

It is also worth noting that our deeper dive intoThe Great Takingrevealed that the bond market is also fractionalized (not enough to go around/some bonds held on the books by more than one owner).

It sounds like a risky proposition to keep calling our government bonds “pristine collateral”, “risk-free”, or a “safe-haven asset”.

2024-04-10 06:55:00,Where NATO Has An 'Enhanced Forward Presence',https://web.archive.org/web/20240410122026/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/where-nato-has-enhanced-forward-presence,"On Monday, Germanysent an advance team of 20 soldiers to Lithuania, laying the groundwork for the recently discussed establishment of a permanent brigade in the NATO country.

According to Deutsche Welle reporting, the 5,000-strong strikeforce called Panzerbrigade 45 is said to become fully operational by 2027. The brigade will support the already existing so-calledNATOEnhanced Forward Presencein the Baltic country, which, in contrast to Panzerbrigade 45, rotates its personnel regularly and was made up of soldiers from Germany, Belgium, Czechia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and the United States as of December 2023.

As Statista's Florian Zandt shows in the chart below,Lithuania is one of eight nations with such a force that's,according to NATO itself, ""defensive, proportionate, transparent and in line with the Alliance’s international commitments and obligations"".

You will find more infographics atStatista

The countries in question constitute a majority of the eastern flank of the coalition, notably excluding Turkey, which has been a member of NATO since 1952 and only contributes a troop contingent to the Bulgarian battlegroup.

Before 2014, only four such battlegroups existed in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. WithRussia's annexation of Crimea, the Enhanced Forward Presence program was expanded to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, with upwards of 1,000 soldiers stationed in the respective country at any time.

Each of the eight battlegroups has a so-called framework nation coordinating the activities in said group.

TheUnited States, for example, command Poland's Enhanced Forward Presence, while the United Kingdom and Germany fulfill this role for the Estonian and Lithuanian battlegroups, respectively. It's important to note that while these troops have a local command structure, they are still led by centralized NATO command centers. For example, the four Baltic battlegroups are organized via headquarters in Latvia and Poland.

While NATO assures the motives for the deployment of troops close or directly next to Russia are ones of deterrence and defense, the expansion of these battlegroups could also be construed as another building block in the active eastwards expansionof the international defense alliance by skeptics of the passive nature of NATO.

2024-04-10 07:20:00,7 More States Sue To Block 'Most Generous Ever' Student Loan Program,https://web.archive.org/web/20240410122026/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/7-more-states-sue-block-most-generous-ever-student-loan-program,"Authored by Bill Pan via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

President Joe Biden faces a fresh lawsuit from a seven-state coalition challenging his “most generous ever” federal student loan repayment plan, under which millions of borrowers would have a monthly bill of $0.

In theircomplaint, filed on April 8 at a federal court in Missouri, the states argued that what the Biden administration calls the SAVE plan is another unlawful attempt to force Americans who incurred no college debt to shoulder the bill for those who did.

“Just last year, the [U.S.] Supreme Court struck down an attempt by the President to force teachers, truckers, and farmers to pay for the student loan debt of other Americans—to the enormous tune of $430 billion,” the complaint stated, noting that the high court’s 6-3 majority explicitly ruled that the president should not bypass Congress to implement a decision with such profound impact on the country’s economy.

“Undeterred, the President is at it again,even braggingthat ’the Supreme Court blocked it. They blocked it. But that didn’t stop me,'” it added.

The lawsuit was spearheaded by Missouri, along with Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Dakota, Ohio, and Oklahoma. It comes just weeks after Kansas and 10 other Republican-led statesfiled a separate challengeto the same plan.

“With the stroke of his pen, Joe Biden is attempting to saddle working Missourians with a half trillion dollars in college debt,” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, said in a statement on April 9.

“The United States Constitution makes clear that the President lacks the authority to unilaterally ‘cancel’ student loan debt for millions of Americans without express permission from Congress.”

Citingan estimateby the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Bailey said the SAVE plan would cost Americans $475 billion over 10 years—$45 billion more than the initial student loan cancellation plan the Supreme Court shot down last June.

Specifically, according to the elite business school,about $200 billion of that cost will come from payment reduction for the $1.64 trillion in loans already outstanding in 2023.The remaining $275 billion comes from reduced payments for about $1.03 trillion in new loans that will be extended over the next 10 years.

“We estimate a take-up rate for future loans of 70 percent, implying that about $645 billion in future loans will be subsidized,” Wharton researchers said. “About 6.57 percent of future borrowers, or 4.98 percent of total predicted loan volume, will never have to make any payments under SAVE.”

According to the latest update from the U.S. Department of Education,SAVE has enrolled over 7.7 million people since it launched last August.

Like the existing income-driven repayment (IDR) option it replaces, SAVE can provide an affordable monthly payment based on income and family size before the eventual discharge of the remaining balance. Its current enrollees include 4.5 million people whose monthly bill was lowered to zero dollars, in addition to about 150,000 borrowers who had their entire debt wiped out.

Under SAVE, those who borrowed $12,000 or less only need to make payments for 10 years before becoming eligible for the final forgiveness, or an additional year for every $1,000 borrowed above $12,000.

In other words, anyone who took out $21,000 or less in undergraduate loans can have their debt erased on a shorter timeline than the standard 20 years.

With the end of his first term now in sight, President Biden has not fulfilled the 2020 campaign promise to cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for every borrower.

In his April 8 trip to Wisconsin, one of the battleground states that could play a pivotal role in his likely November rematch with former President Donald Trump, President Biden touted his effort so far to deliver that promise, which he said would be “life-changing” for more than 30 million borrowers.

“Too many Americans, especially young people, are saddled with unsustainable debts in exchange for a college degree,” he said.

“The ability for working and middle-class folks to repay their student loans has become so burdensome [that] a lot can’t repay for even decades after being in school.”

Republicans, meanwhile, denounced the Biden administration’s actions as a scheme to save dwindling support among young voters.

“Biden wants to use your tax dollars to buy votes because more and more young people are supporting President Trump,” Michael Whatley, chair of the Republican National Committee, said.

2024-04-10 07:21:54,Renewed Inflation Risks Aren't Scaring Buyers Yet,https://web.archive.org/web/20240410122026/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/renewed-inflation-risks-arent-scaring-buyers-yet#comment-stream,"By Michael Msika, Bloomberg markets live reporter and strategist

The stock market’s momentum is stalling and soaring commodity prices have brought inflation worries back to the forefront. For now, it’s not enough to prompt Wall Street strategists to change their bullish view.

HSBC strategists led by Max Kettner say any setback is likely to prove temporary, especially given that the market is still pricing in rate cuts this year. JPMorgan’s traders are “tactically bullish” going into the inflation data, says Andrew Tyler, the bank’s head of US Market Intelligence.

Even so, there are some market worries ahead of the US CPI data and some investors are nervous about stretched valuations before earnings season gets underway. Market momentum has stalled with stocks moving sideways for the better part of a month. Soaring commodity prices are partly to blame as worries shift back to whether persistently high inflation could threaten the rate outlook, especially with recent cautious comments from a number of Fed officials.

To JPMorgan, if the CPI print comes in cooler, it would be a boon for risk assets. Plus, market positioning is supportive given that hedge funds have been selling stocks for several weeks.

They acknowledge it’s harder for inflation to slow, given the strength in the labor market and higher commodity prices, but don’t expect the process to be derailed. “The bull case remains intact with at or above-trend GDP growth, positive earnings growth, and a paused Fed,” they say.

The slight scare of the past few days has made positioning cleaner, with bullish exposure easing, according to Citi. Investors sold $9.4 billion in long S&P 500 positions last week, reversing the flows from the previous week, according to data from quant strategists including Chris Montagu.

Inflation expectations may have been strengthening in the US and in Europe, as demonstrated by breakevens and swap rates creeping higher, but the market hasn’t been complacent. Stock volatility has been on the rise, as has the skew, with greater demand for hedges as we showed in the column yesterday. But crucially, big technical levels are holding firm.

In the meantime, the global economy keeps improving and economic surprises from Europe, the US and China are firmly in positive territory. Even if financial conditions have tightened ahead of the CPI print, they remain on the loose side, still supporting equities at these levels.

“The equity market is now more focused on the better growth outlook, rather than solely on the inflation and rates outlook,” say Barclays strategists including Matthew Joyce. “The growth outlook continues to improve, so any near-term wobble is likely to be trumped by better incoming data.”

A hot number and it’s risk off given it would be a third hot print in a row and positioning is stretched.""

That's really the TL/DR of what to expect from the market tomorrow... with one major provision:a red-hot CPI print and the Fed will likely be unable to twist narrative expectations for a June cut in time absent something big breaking(as even Kashkari asked, why would the ""data dependent Fed"" be cutting if inflation is again ascendant), which in turn means that the Fed would unlikely cut in 2024 as any rate cut during the July 31 meeting (really August) would be seen as too close to the November elections and would prompt howls of outrage from Trump, republicans and a majority of the population. Furthermore, should rate cuts be taken off the table, expect a collapse in risk assets, as the market realizes that unless it itself crashes, the Fed will not move.

Which is why we are rather confident thatafter three consecutive months of core CPI coming in hotter than expectations...

2024-04-10 07:45:00,China Ditches US Farmers For Brazilian Ones In Protest Of Land Ownership Rules,https://web.archive.org/web/20240410122026/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/china-ditches-us-farmers-brazilian-ones-protest-farmland-ownership-rules#comment-stream,"In September 2023, we highlighted that Brazil, one of the BRICS nations, hadovertaken the United Statesin becoming the world's top corn exporter. The sudden shift of China buying Brazilian corn over the US lacked a clear motive at the time. However, now, a newBloombergreport reveals the shift appears to be ""partly in retaliation"" against a wave of legislation aimed at stopping Chinese citizens and companies from owning US farmland.

US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack suggested that China is purchasing Brazilian corn and soybeans mostly in retaliation against Republicans in red states that have enacted or are considering laws barring foreign ownership of farmland.

Vilsack pointed out a recent conversation with his counterpart in China, who mentioned a situation in which the Arkansas government forced seed company Syngenta AG, controlled by China's Sinochem Holdings Corp., to dispose of 160 acres of farmland in the state.

Republican governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed into law the legislation banning foreigners from owning Arkansas farmland. The US ag official said this was part of the constant ""ripping"" of China that prompted Beijing to ditch US farm goods for ones in South America.

""We had a trade deficit of $6 billion in the first quarter of this fiscal year; China's purchases are $6 billion less than they were a year ago,"" Vilsack said in an interview on Tuesday, adding, ""Why would that be? Is it just Brazil, or was there a reason why the Chinese ag minister asked me about Syngenta?""

Vilsack warned that the conservation with the Chinese ag minister is a major ""signal"" for American farmers.

He pointed out that US farmers need to ""diversify away from over-reliance on China"" on ag exports and focus on other countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

China's retaliation against the US will only grow as more than two-thirds of states - primarily Republican-controlled - enacted or are considering laws limiting or barring foreign land ownership.

China is ""an enemy,"" South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican and Trump supporter, recently said.

""They are buying up our entire food supply chain and when America can't feed itself and we rely on another country to feed us it becomes a national security issue,"" Noem recently said. Last month, the governor signed into law a bill that bars China and five other countries from purchasing farmland in the state.

While China shops in South America and Bidenomics has been a failure for blue-collar America as inflation remains elevated, recent US Department of Agriculture forecasts show US farmers are poised for another year of financial misery. They are estimated to face thelargest income drop since 2006 this year.

Whatever happened to China following the various phases of the trade agreement under Trump and meeting certain quotas on purchasing US farm goods?

2024-04-10 07:59:28,Futures On Edge Ahead Of Critical CPI Report,https://web.archive.org/web/20240410122026/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/futures-edge-ahead-critical-cpi-report#comment-stream,"Futures are up small before the March CPI data was expected to show further moderation in price pressures following stronger readings at the start of the year, with Mag7 mixed and Semis lower, tracking bigger gains in Europe. Bond yields are uniformly 1bps lower, USD is off a touch, and commodities are mostly higher led by base metals and Ags. The CPI print is the clear focus today but keep an eye on the bond auctions (yesterday’s 3Y auction required a concession), 2x Fed speakers (Bowman, Goolsbee), and then the Fed Minutes this afternoon to look for any hints on policy including changes to QT.

In premarket trading, TSMC ADRs rose 0.5% after the Taiwanese chipmaker reported better-than-expected sales growth for the first quarter. The chip giant's quarterly revenue grew at its fastest pace in more than a year, shoring up expectations that a global boom in artificial intelligence development is fueling demand for high-end chips and servers. The main chipmaker to Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. reported a better-than-expected 16% rise in March-quarter sales to about NT$592.6 billion ($18.5 billion), versus the NT$579.5 billion average projection. Alphabet shares rose 0.7%, set to extend gains for a fourth consecutive session, as Google unveiled a host of updates to its artificial intelligence offerings at its annual cloud conference.

Here are some other notable premarket movers:

Asdiscussed earlier, economists forecast that consumer prices rose 0.3% in March on a monthly basis, both overall and excluding food and energy costs. While that would mark a step down from the previous two months, it may not be enough for Federal Reserve officials looking for even lower readings, although both Goldman and JPM expect the final CPI prints to come in on the dovish side of expectations. A hot number could“put a question mark on whether the Fed will cut at all this summer and will it be a September time frame,”said Guy Miller, chief strategist at Zurich Insurance Co. This would mean a further delay and “markets are very vulnerable to that as we have seen significant multiple expansion in the past 12 months,” he said (our fullCPI preview is here).

Wall Street traders predict stocks could move 2% either way on a surprise inflation number. Both JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs trading desks see stocks falling some 2% if the consumer price index tops 0.4% in March on a monthly basis. However, both banks say they view any hit to the market as temporary. For those who missed our full preview (available here) here is the Goldman...

... and JPM reaction matrix (for core CPI MoM):

“This bull market continues irrespective of what happens with CPI,” said JPMorgan’s Market Intelligence traders led by Andrew Tyler (full note available here for pro subs). They point to a supportive backdrop, where the economy and corporate profits are growing and the Fed is on pause.

The straddle-implied move for today's move is 0.98%, up notably from last month's expectation of a 0.95% move and notably higher from the January's 0.70% move on CPI day; this is also the highest since November, but generally on the low side over the past two years.

Meanwhile, leading market strategists are optimistic that Corporate America can help fuel the next leg of the stock market rally by delivering another bumper earnings season. Even pricey technology stocks — the primary profit engine in the previous quarter — are again expected to be supported by solid results.  While the S&P 500 Index is coming off its best first quarter in five years and trading near its all-time high, market experts are reluctant to bet against further gains.

“It’s way too early to apply the brakes on the US stock rally,” said Manish Kabra, head of US equity strategy at Societe Generale SA. “The momentum has been backed up by the earnings outlook, and I expect that to continue for at least one more quarter.”

Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to post a “healthy” 10% gain in the first quarter in headline numbers from a year ago, according to Deutsche Bank AG strategists. Earnings upgrades from analysts have outnumbered downgrades in the first quarter, according to a Citigroup Inc. index.

In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index was higher Wednesday, rebounding from the previous session’s losses,as surging sales at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. from the boom in global AI development boosted tech stocks. Miners advanced after gains in copper, iron ore and gold. Tesco Plc rose as it forecast higher retail profit and announced a share buyback.  The gains come a day before an interest-rates announcement from the European Central Bank that’s widely expected to prepare markets for an initial cut in June as price pressures in the region ease. Here are the biggest European movers:

Earlier in the session, Asian stocks rose, as gains in Chinese technology shares helped counter declines in Japan, with a numbers of markets closed for holidays. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose as much as 0.4%, on track for its third day of gains. Alibaba, Tencent and Meituan were among the top contributors to the regional benchmark’s advance, and helped push a gauge of Hong Kong-listed tech shares 2.5% higher; meanwhilean index of Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks gained for the third day and entered a technical bull market after advancing 20% from a January low.Stocks fell in Tokyo as investors assessed the risk of further interest-rate hikes this year in Japan.

TSMC’s quarterly revenue grew at its fastest pace in more than a year, shoring up expectations that a global boom in artificial intelligence development is fueling demand for high-end chips and servers. The main chipmaker to Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. reported a better-than-expected 16% rise in March-quarter sales to about NT$592.6 billion ($18.5 billion), versus the NT$579.5 billion average projection.

European stocks are on course for their best day in almost three weeks with technology names leading after a positive update from TSMC. The main chipmaker to Nvidia and Apple reported a better-than-expected 16% rise in March-quarter sales. The Stoxx 600 is up 0.6%, with retail, bank, auto and mining shares also outperforming.

In FX, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index falls 0.1% while the kiwi sits atop the G-10 FX pile, rising 0.2% versus the greenback after a hawkish hold from the RBNZ. The NZD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.6069, gaining for a third day. Leverage sellers sold the spot at Tuesday’s 0.6077 high immediately after the rate decision, according to an Asia-based FX trader “NZD can remain supported and AUD/NZD may remain under a little downward pressure over the very near-term,” said Peter Dragicevich, a strategist at Corpay Solutions. “However, a change in the RBNZ’s viewpoint and bias looks to be a matter of time based on the weakness across the NZ economy and moderating inflation pressures.”

In rates, treasuries edge higher ahead of US inflation data due later on Wednesday,with 10-year yields falling 1bps to 4.35%,slightly outperforming gilts in the sector; curve spreads are likewise little changed, with price action limited ahead of CPI and 10-year note auction. US session also includes 10-year note reopening at 1pm, following soft reception for Tuesday’s 3-year note auction, and 2pm release of minutes of March FOMC meeting. WI 10-year yield at around 4.36% is ~19.5bp cheaper than last month’s result, a 0.9bp tail. The market set-up into CPI data appears to have favored short positions, posing risk of a squeeze in the event of benign readings.

In commodities, oil prices advance, with WTI rising 0.2% to trade near $85.40. Oil was steady following back-to-back losses after an industry report pointed to a gain in US crude stockpiles, although simmering tensions in the Middle East are expected to cap losses. Iron ore was near a two-week high following a 10% surge fueled by bets that a recent slump was overdone. Copper extended its rally to $9,500 a ton amid supply risks and a brightening outlook for demand. Prices have risen more than 10% on the London Metal Exchange this year, making copper one of the best-performing industrial metals. Finally, gold held a record high as investors positioned for the inflation data.

In crypto, Hong Kong is likely to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs next week and some launches could happen in April, according to Reuters sources.

Looking at today's calendar, the US economic data slate includes March CPI (8:30am), February wholesale inventories (10am) and March monthly budget statement (2pm). Fed speakers scheduled for the session include Bowman (8:45am) and Goolsbee and Barkin in a panel discussion at 12:45pm. And from other central banks, there’s a policy decision from the Bank of Canada, and we’ll get the FOMC minutes from the March meeting.

DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap

US Treasuries posted a strong rally ahead of today’s US CPI release for March, with the 10yr yield (-5.8bps) seeing its biggest daily decline in over two weeks. That meant yields came off their highs for the year on Monday, and this morning we’ve seen a further -0.8bps decline to 4.35%. Meanwhile for equities, the S&P 500 saw a late rally to post a modest gain (+0.14%), with the index finding a more stable footing after last week’s decline. Nevertheless, the S&P 500 has now gone 7 consecutive sessions without a new record, which is the longest period without an all-time high since January, back when the S&P 500 surpassed its 2022 peak. So it makes a change from the pattern of very strong gains over recent months, with the index currently on a run of 5 consecutive monthly gains since November.

Looking ahead to today, the US CPI print will be heavily in focus after the last two prints came in strongly. They showed core CPI running at a monthly +0.4% in both January and February, which has led to concern that inflation could end up remaining sticky above target levels. For now at least, the Fed haven’t sounded too concerned, and Fed Chair Powell said last week that “it is too soon to say whether the recent readings represent more than just a bump.” But today’s print will be crucial, as if there is a third strong reading, it would be increasingly difficult to explain that as just a temporary blip. A related point was made yesterday by Atlanta Fed President Bostic, one of the more hawkish FOMC voices. He reiterated that he only expects one rate cut this year. And when asked if the Fed might not cut at all this year, he said that “I can’t take off the possibility that the rate cuts may even have to move further out.”

In terms of what to expect today, our US economists are looking for headline CPI to be at a monthly +0.27%, with the year-on-year measure picking up two-tenths to +3.4%. Then for core CPI, they’re forecasting a monthly +0.24%, with the year-on-year measure declining to +3.7%. You can read their full preview here, along with how to sign up for their webinar discussing the report.

Ahead of the report, there were some signs that investor concern was easing about inflation, at least compared to the rise in recent days. For instance, the US 2yr inflation swap reached a peak of nearly 2.56% early in yesterday’s session, its highest since October, but was down to 2.53% at the close. That also coincided with a fall in oil prices, with Brent Crude (-1.06%) falling back for a second day and closing beneath $90/bbl again. Moreover, investors dialled up the probability that the Fed would still cut rates, with the probability of a cut by June moving up to 60%, having been at 52% the previous day.

With the slightly better inflation news, sovereign bonds experienced a strong rally on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US, that meant the 2yr and the 10yr Treasury yield both moved off their year-to-date high from the previous day, with the 2yr yield (-4.6bps) down to 4.74%, whilst the 10yr yield (-5.8bps) fell to 4.36%. However, the downtrend in yields ran out of steam after a soft 3-year Treasury auction, which saw $58bn of notes issued 2bps above the pre-sale yield, the largest tail in over a year. Over in Europe there were similar moves, and yields on 10yr bunds (-6.4bps), OATs (-6.3bps) and BTPs (-7.5bps) all moved lower.

Equities had looked on course for a weak session yesterday, with the S&P 500 trading half a percent down in the final hour of trading, but a late rally left the index up +0.14% by the close. Rate-sensitive sectors outperformed, with utilities up +0.55%, while cyclical sectors underperformed, with financials (-0.50%) and industrials (-0.22%) seeing declines. Both the NASDAQ (+0.32%) and the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.34%) posted moderate advances. Most members of the Magnificent 7 (+0.20%) posted gains, but its gain was limited by a -2.04% decline for Nvidia on news of a new AI accelerator chip announced by Intel (+0.92%). Meanwhile in Europe, there were large declines, with the STOXX 600 (-0.61%), the DAX (-1.32%) and the CAC 40 (-0.86%) all falling back. Indeed, for the Dax, this was the weakest session in over three months.

Overnight in Asia, there have been losses across several indices, including the Nikkei (-0.32%), the CSI 300 (-0.43%) and the Shanghai Comp (-0.34%), whilst markets in South Korea are closed for a holiday. The main exception to this pattern has been the Hang Seng (+1.88%), with the index currently on track for its highest closing level since November.

In other news overnight, Fitch Ratings revised their outlook on China to negative, while keeping the rating at A+. Separately in New Zealand, the central bank maintained the Official Cash Rate at 5.5%, and their statement said that “A restrictive monetary policy stance remains necessary to further reduce capacity pressures and inflation.” And over in Japan, the PPI data for March came in at +0.8% year-on-year, in line with expectations, up from an upwardly revised +0.7% in February. That came as BoJ Governor Ueda said that “We won’t consider changing monetary policy at all to directly respond to moves in foreign exchange”.

Looking back at yesterday’s data, the ECB Bank Lending Survey for Q1 showed a continued turn in the bank credit cycle. Pockets of weakness were still evident, including a deterioration in demand for corporate loans, probably reflecting the rise in rates since the start of the year. But with banks expecting further normalisation in Q2, the BLS points to an improving cyclical picture in the euro area. That said, whether this improvement materialises may well depend on whether expectations of upcoming ECB rate cuts prove accurate.

Finally in the US, the NFIB’s small business optimism index fell to an 11-year low of 88.5 in March (vs. 89.9 expected). There were also signs of weakness elsewhere in the release, as the number of firms saying they planned to increase employment fell to a net +11%, the lowest since May 2020.

To the day ahead now, and the main data highlight will be the US CPI release for March. Otherwise, there’s Italian retail sales for February. And from central banks, there’s a policy decision from the Bank of Canada, and we’ll get the FOMC minutes from the March meeting.

2024-04-10 08:15:00,Inflation Has Become A Bigger Risk For Stretched Gold Prices,https://web.archive.org/web/20240410122026/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/inflation-has-become-bigger-risk-stretched-gold-prices,"Authored by Simon White, Bloomberg macro strategist,

Gold’srelationship with inflation is variable, but we are at the point in the cycle where the precious metal’ssensitivity to CPI is heightened.

Overbought gold is thusparticularly exposed should today’s inflation data come in softerthan expected.

Gold is not a straightforward inflation hedge - the correlation between gold returns and consumer prices is very close to zero over the long term. Instead, the interplay between inflation and rates is a better prism through which to understand gold.

Real interest rates and gold are generally taken to move inversely to one another.This observation is known as Gibson’s Paradox (named a paradox by Keynes as it contravened standard economic theory), while Gibson’s Rule states that for every percentage point the real fed funds rate was below 2%, gold should rally 8% over the next year.

It sounds a great rule of thumb. Unfortunately the data does not bear it out.If we look over the past 50 years of the real fed funds rate (deflated using CPI) and the subsequent one-year return of gold (in dollar terms), the relationship is not linear. What we find is something more parabolic, with a sweet spot for gold returns when real rates are between -2% and +2%.

Over the past 18 months or so, real rates have been in and around this sweet spot, and over the last six months gold is up almost 30%.

Now, however, real fed funds is 2.3%, i.e where the red circle is in the chart above.We are moving away from the sweet spot. Gold is now therefore more sensitive to inflation, as a drop in it would take real yields further to the right in the chart, and imply poorer forward returns.

Inflation continues to be biased higher, but there’s little to stop one weaker-than-expected print at today’s data, which would be liable to trigger a selloff given how overbought gold currently is.

Nonetheless, real yields are unlikely to deviate too far from their sweet spot in the medium term,meaning any dips in gold are unlikely to last too long.

2024-04-10 21:20:00,"Inflation Check: Doctors Making $350,000 Per Year Can't Find Homes In Long Island As Prices Surge 50%",https://web.archive.org/web/20240411114920/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/inflation-check-doctors-making-350000-year-cant-find-homes-long-island-prices-surge-50,"While every news anchor and talking head in the world of finance continues to congratulate the Fed despite inflation still not being under control, prices are telling another story.

Specifically, housing prices. In fact,a new report fromBloombergis now detailing how even doctors making $350,000 per year are ""struggling"" to find places to live in locales like Long Island.

The report cites the region's ""chronic housing shortage"" and detailed the story of Paul Connor, who helps run Stony Brook's Eastern Long Island Hospital.

“The single most difficult impediment to get around right now is the housing prices,"" he said of the area.

Long Island's North Fork, including Greenport, epitomizes New York's severe housing crunch, with home prices surging by 50% to nearly $1 million, and available listings plummeting by 60% for its 50,000 residents, the report says.

This crisis mirrors a broader state issue, characterized by a mismatch of job growth to housing availability, leading to historically low rental vacancies in New York City and skyrocketing rents - and spitting in the face of the narrative that inflation is cooling.

Upstate areas like Buffalo and Syracuse also face soaring property prices, compounded by restrictive zoning in the suburbs and mortgage rates nearing 7%, making homeownership increasingly unattainable. Suffolk County's meager housing growth rate, one of the lowest in the state, further underscores the acute challenge of expanding the housing supply to meet demand.

Rachel Fee, Executive Director of the New York Housing Conference added: “It’s a huge concern. It’s not just a New York City issue anymore. Affordability is an issue across the state.”

“Part of the squeeze with the North Fork is the spillover effect from the Hamptons because prices have risen so rapidly that the North Fork became this cheaper alternative — until it wasn’t,"" added Jonathan Miller, President of Miller Samuel.

Connor concluded: “Whether you’re a cardiologist or you work in one of the local restaurants, it’s to the advantage of everyone in our community to have people who live and work locally.”

2024-04-10 21:40:00,It’s Time For A U.S. STEM Talent Strategy To Compete With China,https://web.archive.org/web/20240411114920/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/its-time-us-stem-talent-strategy-compete-china,"Authored by Dan Reed & Dario Gil via RealClear Wire,

U.S. innovation fuels our economic strength and is vital for our national security.Released last earlier this month, the National Science Board’s congressionally mandatedState of U.S. Science and Engineering Indicatorsreport shows that an accelerating science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) talent crisis is imperiling America’s economy and security.

Let’s start with a bit of perspective.The U.S. STEM workforce is now one quarter of the total U.S. workforce – 38 million people at all degree levels who use STEM skills in their jobs, including 19 million skilled technical workers without a bachelor’s degree.That number will only rise as companies expand their STEM workforce and their R&D investments in response to rising global competition. The CHIPS & Science Act is now funding one response to global competition and national security risk -- the reshoring of our semiconductor production.

Meanwhile, key technological sectors, including semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, face major challenges in filling urgently needed job openings, and making the promise of economic development a reality. Let’s be clear –China is gaining on us, and it has articulated plans to increase its R&D investment even further.Indicatorsdata show that China recently surpassed the United States in research publications and patent applications, and China’s growth in high impact articles is outpacing its overall growth in publications. These overall trends are also true for the specific field of artificial intelligence – a field that is critical to national security. We cannot risk falling behind.

We must address this crisis now. How?

First, we must increase the flow of domestic talent into the STEM workforce.To start, Congress must fully fund the remaining parts of CHIPS & Science Act – investing in developing the STEM workforce, from preK-12 education through skilled technical workers and college STEM graduates to doctoral-level researchers in industry and academia. Sadly, the spending bill that Congress just passed cuts some of our most important science federal agencies, like the National Science Foundation, moving us backwards.

Second, we need new policiesthat double-down on one of our nation’s greatest strengths: attracting and retaining top STEM talent from around the world, including from countries that are emerging science partners. We must do more to entice and enable science and engineering students to work in the U.S. after they receive their degrees.

Third, we need a modern-day National Defense Education Act (NDEA)to spur private and public collaboration and provide the specific skills and talent needed by American industry.

An NDEA that would: invest in preK-12 STEM education and increase our STEM teacher supply across the country. Build capacity for the gateways into STEM training across the country: community colleges, technical schools, and other geographically and financially accessible institutions. Expand graduate fellowship programs, with a focus on critical and emerging technologies. Create national service programs like the Defense Civilian Training Corps and increase scholarships for low-income individuals. Increase options for foreign-born STEM talent to stay after their education and training and reduce barriers for doing so.

This is a national call-for-action.We need all-hands on deck – no group alone can solve this problem. Business, government, and academia must come together in a collaborative partnership and commitment far beyond the scale in which we are investing now. Otherwise, we risk ceding U.S. science and engineering leadership to China, with deep and lasting negative effects on our national security and our economic competitiveness.

According to the poll,43% ""strongly agree""that the border crisis is being facilitated for political advantage, while 14% ""somewhat agree."" 29% ""strongly disagree,"" while 8% ""somewhat disagree.""

Hispanicvoters, despite having leaned Democrat in every general and midterm election since1980,are actually more likely to believe Biden is exploiting illegal immigration than any other ethnic group.Forty-eight percent strongly agree this is what the Democrat leader is doing, and 20 percent somewhat agree for a combined 68 percent. This compares to 17 percent who strongly disagree and seven percent who somewhat disagree.

A combined 54 percent of white voters agree Biden is trying to create a permanent majority, and a plurality of 47 percent ofblackvoters agree. -National Pulse

Meanwhile 36% of self-identified moderates believe Biden is trying to create a permanent majority, as do 36% of Democrats.

In February, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas claimed that the Biden administrationdoesn't bear responsibility for the border crisis,despite, among other things:

(It's areally long list...)

And since Biden was sworn in as president in January 2021,there have been at least10 million illegalswho have entered the United States, while the government deals with a backlog of more than 3 million asylum cases in US courts.

""Do you bear responsibility for what is happening at the border?""MAYORKAS: ""We don't bear responsibility""pic.twitter.com/rCdwOIAIAX

We're sure Congressional Republicans will have all sort of nice things to say about immigration when we get to the amnesty phase of the operation.

2024-04-10 22:20:00,California's Latest Hustle: Utility Bills Based On Ratepayers' Income,https://web.archive.org/web/20240411114920/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/californias-latest-hustle-utility-bills-based-ratepayers-income#comment-stream,"Authored by Jane L. Johnson via The Mises Institute,

Utility bills - for electricity, natural gas, water, and garbage - have by long-standing tradition been based on customer usage, measured in kilowatt-hours of electricity, therms or Btu of natural gas, hundred cubic feet of water, or number of garbage cans.

Every residence and business has electric, gas, and water meters that measure utility usage.

But changes are afoot in the utility business as federal and state governments urge Americans to convert from fossil fuels to electricity for home heating, appliances, and transportation.From this transition will undoubtedly follow changes in utility rate-setting models.

Some electric utilities currently charge customers a flat, fixed fee as well as usage-based charges, both on the same monthly bill. The fixed fees, often called “customer charges” or “meter-reading charges,” are imposed irrespective of energy usage. These fees assure revenue stability and offset the overhead expenses of running electric utilities. Energy usage-based charges, which can vary seasonally, are designed (and regulated) to recover the cost of the electricity sold.

Economists refer to this pricing strategy as atwo-part tariffin which the consumer must pay a fixed fee for the right to buy a product or service (energy in the case of electric utilities).This pricing model effectively maximizes revenue for sellers that have some monopoly pricing power in their respective markets because of the way they have structured their businesses.Electric utilities are, of course, regulated monopolies that serve designated geographic areas.

Disneyland charges high entrance fees to its theme parks, but prices for individual rides are just sufficiently high to cover the marginal cost of operating the rides. A family that has traveled from Kansas to California or Florida Disney venues will likely not balk at paying high admission fees combined with low per-ride ticket prices.

Popular retailer Costco charges annual membership dues that allow customers to buy large product packages at relatively low unit prices. While Costco isn’t strictly considered a monopoly among warehouse stores, its unique membership and marketing methods effectively give it monopoly status with great cachet.

Country clubs typically charge high membership fees that offer members the right to buy greens fees and participate in social activities with other like-minded, equally affluent members.

Bars levy admission cover charges combined with fees per drink once patrons are inside.

The strategy works when sellers can easily identify different buyer groups and prohibit individual buyers from selling to nonmember buyers.

For example, country club members cannot resell greens fees or social activities to nonmembers. Disneyland visitors cannot resell ride tickets to those who have not paid the entrance fee. And electric utility ratepayers cannot resell to others who don’t have accounts with the utility.

But what if utilities based their fixed fee on customers’ income levels rather than a flat uniform fee for every customer?

California, home to 10 percent of the total US population and often considered a state laboratory where policies begin before adoption across the nation, offers a glimpse into the future of utility rate setting as the two-part tariff pricing model has now taken on a new wrinkle.

In 2022 the supermajority Democrat state legislature passed and the governor signedAssembly Bill 205(AB 205), which ordered the California Public Utilities Commission to authorize a “fixed charge” on residential electric bills by July 2024. Customers of the three large investor-owned utilities (IOUs)—Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas and Electric—would pay this charge regardless of their electricity usage and in addition to that usage. The basis of the fixed charge is to be determined by each IOU utility, subject to approval by the California Public Utilities Commission.

The legislation also required the utilities to reduce their rates for electricity usage in order to assist low-income customers as electricity prices continue to rise.This represents not only a major shift in the standard rate-setting model from usage orientation to fixed charges but also a new emphasis on income and wealth redistribution from high-income customers to low-income, somewhat akin to a progressive income tax.

There is no precedent for such redistribution in utility rate regulation.

AB 205 was intended to ensure that the IOUs’ new two-part pricing strategy be revenue-neutral - that is, continue to make sufficient revenue to invest in needed infrastructure for long-distance transmission (picture large pylons across the landscape) and distribution (local power lines delivering power to retail customers). The three IOUs own the vast majority of California’s energy infrastructure (poles and wires), construction and maintenance of which are so vital to greater electrification of homes and transportation as California focuses on transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

A further intent of the legislation, moreover, was to raise additional revenue to pay for burying power lines that might otherwise ignite wildfires and constructing facilities to carry solar and wind-generated energy to large urban areas.Higher-income customers would pay a disproportionately high share of these construction and maintenance costs, even if they don’t use more power.

It all sounded like a win-win for progressives:

Rich people pay more for energy, poor people pay less, and everyone makes progress on global warming.

Until, that is, questions arose on possible fallout from this new rate-setting model:

How to determine ratepayers’ income levels without invading their privacy?

How might higher income-based fixed charges, coupled with lower kilowatt-hours usage rates, reduce financial incentives to conserve energy usage?

How might lower usage rates affect desirable future sales of rooftop solar installation?

Because of these imponderables and because the California Public Utilities Commission has not approved any of several possible methodologies to implement AB 205, one legislator has now introducedAssembly Bill 1999to repeal the fixed-charge mandate. Another legislator who voted for AB 205 now confesses that the legislation was long and confusing and was called up for a vote very shortly after its text was available to read.

Blame is being passed around.

Is the original AB 205 merely a profit-grab by the three large IOUs?Were legislators remiss in approving it too quickly in their zeal to mandate climate goals?Who originally decided to incorporate the income-based fixed charge into the legislation?

Addressing these questions may be a challenge, something akin to solving analgebraic problemwith more variables than equations, which leaves only an indeterminate solution. Too many conditions must be satisfied: revenue neutrality, protecting customer privacy when determining their income levels, energy usage rates low enough to protect low-income customers, usage rates high enough to encourage energy conservation and future installation of rooftop solar, sufficient revenue to invest in infrastructure for wildfire prevention, and additional grid capacity to support electric vehicle recharging stations and home heat pumps.

It is possible to solve such problems using linear programming, maximizing a linear function subject to the various constraints. But it is unlikely that California Public Utilities Commission staff could grapple with such a solution in time to approve income-based electric utility two-part tariffs in time for July 2024 implementation.

Whether this two-part tariff income-based pricing model might migrate to utilities in other states is unclear at this point, but its success or failure in California will probably determine its ultimate fate.In the meantime, perhaps the original legislation AB 205 is so poorly written that it should be repealed outright, consigning another well-intentioned governmental intervention effort to the proverbial dustbin of history.

2024-04-10 22:40:00,Huge Dovish Bet Loses $50 Million In One Day,https://web.archive.org/web/20240411114920/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/huge-dovish-bet-loses-50-million-one-day#comment-stream,"Late on Tuesday, the financial world was swept up by a report from Bloomberg according to which an unknown trader had put on single record-sized trade, betting that today's CPI print would come in dovish, and forcing the Fed to cut sooner. It did not work out quite as expected.

For those who missed it, a significant block trade in US short-term interest-rate futures, specifically in December 2024 SOFR futures, took place during market hours on Tuesday, marking the largest trade of its kind. This trade - which was widely publicized by Bloomberg - contributed to driving gains in the Treasury market. After all,nobody would gamble tens of millions if they didn't know something.

The trade, likely initiated by a buyer, coincided with expectations of benign March consumer price index data, potentially leading to a revival in expectations for Fed rate cuts. Confidence in this outlook was reinforced by State Street Global Advisors predicting an aggressive half-point Fed rate cut by June and remarks from US President Joe Biden’s economic aide, Lael Brainard. As of the time of the trade, the swaps market was pricing in approximately 65 basis points of Fed rate cuts by year-end. The December 2024 SOFR futures were trading slightly higher than the block trade’s price, indicating continued market activity and investor interest in hedging or speculating on interest rate movements.

In retrospect, it turned out that the trader really didn't know anything, and on Wednesday the trade blew up in spectacular fashion after a stronger-than-expected reading triggered a market rout.

According to Bloomberg calculations,moments after the CPI print, which came in hot on every possible metric, the position was roughly $50 million in the red, based on price moves in the underlying December 2024 futures.

As duly noted earlier, after Wednesday’s red hot report, expectations for the first full quarter-point rate cut this year wilted and shifted to November from September, with the market now pricing in less than two 25 basis-point moves for all of 2024.

While it's not known who placed the record futures bet, or whether it was made in conjunction with other trades, the scale of the block trade — with a $2MM DV01, or $2 million in gains or losses per basis point move — suggests it was made to offset a separate underlying position, possibly a bearish stance although it is unclear. Separate data released Wednesday from the CME suggested the trade was a new wager or hedge, rather than short-covering of an existing position.

The unknown trader was not the only casualty of today's red hot inflation number: on Tuesday, State Street predicted a half-point cut as soon as the June meeting; instead swaps are now pricing in just 3 basis points of cuts for the FOMC meeting. If State Street had put money on the trade, it is now gone... all gone.

2024-04-10 23:00:00,The End Of The Neo-Liberal Order,https://web.archive.org/web/20240411114920/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/end-neo-liberal-order#comment-stream,"Authored by 'Dalwhinnie' via BombThrower.com,

The historian Prof. Gary Gerstle maintained that the neo liberal order was coming to an end, that free movement of goods, money, ideas and talent characterized the neo liberal order and that it was in the process of losing ascendancy.Losing ascendancy does not mean disappearing, it means losing ascendancy. Peter Zeihan says much the same and locates the issue in the guarantee offered by the US Navy since WW2 to police the sea lanes of the world. Also large diesel engines and cheap fuel may have as much to do with trade as any deliberate policy measures. I digress.

Somewhat to my surprise I agreed with the leftist professor of history.

So far so good. I have ordered his book and will read it skeptically. (The Rise and Fall of the Neo-Liberal Order).

The neo liberal order got going about the time of Reagan and Thatcher and was characterized by reliance upon, and praise for, the market. In the period under discussion, various US Presidents, of whom Clinton is prominent, also pursued neo liberal promarket policies. This illustrates the tendency for large movements of policy to continue despite changes in the party holding the presidency. Canada obtained free trade with the US, and many liberalizing trade measures were adopted throughout this period roughly 1970-2000.

The next assertion of the professor was that the dominance of neo liberalism was coming to an end. I also agree with that assertion, perhaps for different reasons than those of the learned professor.

The effects of the neo liberal order were various and I shall try to point out the major features.This is obviously me talking, not Professor Gerstle.

off shoring of domestic North American manufacturing, which led to the gutting of manufacturing towns, increasing despair and drug addictions (viz Angus Deaton on deaths of despair in the working class) and much cheaper goods at the stores

Industrialization of much of the rest of the world. When did you first notice that clothing you wore came from Cambodia, Indonesia, or Vietnam?

Very significant increase of the national share of wealth to the top 1% and eventually the top 1% of the 1% as the economy became more monetary and intangible and less a matter of things produced. Software firms worth more than Boeing or Ford for instance.

Oxycontin plagues and mass drug addictions

Very high rates of non white immigration of peoples to Europe and North America. You are not supposed to notice this, by the way. But assimilation is not proceeding too well in many European countries and the same process is well underway in the United States.

The remainder of Professor Gerstle’s talk concerned Trump, Orban and Bolsonaro and the supposed authoritarianism of same and the threat to democracy. I should say “democracy” because clearly the word has become code for something other than changes of governments in a populist direction. These are held to be threats to “democracy” which seem to consist of changes of history of which leftists disapprove.

Here is where I depart from Professor Gerstle’s alarmism about populist changes to governments.

He was also concerned with the January 6th insurrection on the hill and the menace it portended to the continuity of American institutions. I was once very alarmed by January 6th riots until I began to believe the entire event was a police -infiltrated and significantly police-inspired stunt to disgrace Trump. It has worked.

Prof. Gerstle along with many other Democrats believes that democracy is under attack.

Let me try to set forth the reasoning of many on the Trumpist right, if “right” is the term to be applied. Here we get to territory that will summon forth political disagreement.

For many of us, a combination of events has persuaded us that democracy is already in grave danger from the following, which is largely drawn from the US experience.

A politicized leftist judiciary and prosecutorial apparatus

A politicized federal police

A politicized intelligence apparatus

An almost certainly manipulated if not stolen presidential election

Uncontrolled immigration of people, some of whom are in the United States with subversive intentions

The immigration of 20 or 40 millions is not being controlled because the Democrats want to achieve permanent electoral supremacy by endowing the illegals with votes

A minor but serious plague has been used as a pretext for a massive repression of personal liberties both of trade and movement on the basis of compulsory vaccination by radical mRNA therapies that have been insufficiently tested, and which appear to be causing a serious increase of deaths in the general population

which plague was engineered by experiments in gain of function (increased lethality) research funded by US sources in Chinese laboratories (RFK I pushing these buttons as a central part of his electoral campaign)

A push by all global leaders and bureaucracies to reduce energetic throughputs, the basis of wealth creation, in the name of a spurious climate agenda.

A fundamental attack on sex roles being carried on as the focus of the next personal liberation struggle.

So yes, the people, rightly or wrongly, are unhappy with the state of their governments and what these governments have so clearly indicated they wish to do.

Consequently, as a result of governments being so badly misaligned with their electorates, and so apparently ready to call opposition to their intentions as “far right” “fascist” “transphobic”, and so ready to denigrate the white settler populations of which the electorate is still mostly composed, the neo liberal order is coming to an end. This is occurring not because of trade issues, or income inequality, but because of fundamental challenges posed by left wing governments to the people who still compose the electorates.

To what do we belong? To the nation, or to various sexual and cultural minorities?

Trump has a clear answer. Biden, if he has an answer at all, says that most Americans belong to an illegitimate race. And if he cannot say this, his minions state it or insinuate it.

The neo liberal order is coming to an end because the issues have decisively moved on from trade and markets to identity and belonging.

2024-04-10 23:40:00,Tyranny By The Numbers: The Government Wants Your Money Any Way It Can Get It,https://web.archive.org/web/20240411114920/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/tyranny-numbers-government-wants-your-money-any-way-it-can-get-it,"Authored by John & Nisha Whitehead via The Rutherford Institute,

The government wants your money.

It will beg, steal or borrow if necessary, but it wants your money any way it can get it.

This is what comes of those$1.2 trillion spending bills: someone’s got to foot the bill for the government’s fiscal insanity, and that “someone” is the U.S. taxpayer.

The government’s schemes to swindle, cheat, scam, and generally defraud taxpayers of their hard-earned dollars have run the gamut from wasteful pork barrel legislation, cronyism and graft to asset forfeiture, costly stimulus packages, and a national security complex that continues to undermine our freedoms while failing to making us any safer.

Americans have also been made to pay through the nose for the government’s endless wars, subsidization of foreign nations, military empire, welfare state, roads to nowhere, bloated workforce, secret agencies, fusion centers, private prisons, biometric databases, invasive technologies, arsenal of weapons, and every other budgetary line item that is contributing to the fast-growing wealth of the corporate elite at the expense of those who are barely making ends meet—that is, we the taxpayers.

According to the number crunchers with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, in order to spend money it doesn’t have on programs it can’t afford, the government isborrowing roughly $6 billion a day.

Basically, the U.S. government is funding its existence with a credit card.

Let’s talk numbers, shall we?

Thenational debt(the amount the federal government has borrowed over the years and must pay back) is more than$34 trillionand will grow another$19 trillion by 2033.

The bulk of that debt has beenamassed over the past two decades, thanks in large part to the fiscal shenanigans of four presidents, 10 sessions of Congress and two wars.

It’s estimated that the amount this country owes is now130% greater than its gross domestic product(all the products and services produced in one yearby labor and property supplied by the citizens).

In other words, the government is spending more than it brings in.

The U.S. ranks as the12th most indebted nationin the world, with much of that debt owed to the Federal Reserve, large investment funds and foreign governments, namely,Japan and China.

Interest payments on the national debt are more than $395 billion, which is significantly more than the government spends on veterans’ benefits and services, andaccording to Pew Research Center, more than it will spend on elementary and secondary education, disaster relief, agriculture, science and space programs, foreign aid, and natural resources and environmental protectioncombined.

According to theCommittee for a Reasonable Federal Budget, the interest we’ve paid on this borrowed money is “nearly twice what the federal government will spend on transportation infrastructure, over four times as much as it will spend on K-12 education, almost four times what it will spend on housing, and over eight times what it will spend on science, space, and technology.”

In ten years, those interest payments willexceed our entire military budget.

This is financial tyranny.

We’ve been sold a bill of goods by politicians promising to pay down the national debt, jumpstart the economy, rebuild our infrastructure, secure our borders, ensure our security, and make us all healthy, wealthy and happy.

None of that has come to pass, and yet we’re still being loaded down with debt not of our own making while the government remains unrepentant, unfazed and undeterred in its wanton spending.

Indeed, the national deficit (the difference between what the government spends and the revenue it takes in) remains at more than$1.5 trillion.

If Americans managed their personal finances the way the government mismanages the nation’s finances, we’d all be in debtors’ prison by now.

Despite the government propaganda being peddled by the politicians and news media, however, the government isn’t spendingourtax dollars to makeourlives better.

We’re being robbed blind so the governmental elite can get richer.

In the eyes of the government, “we the people, the voters, the consumers, and the taxpayers” are little more than pocketbooks waiting to be picked.

“We the people” have become the new, permanent underclass in America.

Consider: The government can seize your home and your car (which you’ve bought and paid for) over nonpayment of taxes. Government agents can freeze and seize your bank accounts and other valuables if they merely “suspect” wrongdoing. And the IRS insists on getting the first cut of your salary to pay for government programs over which you have no say.

We have no real say in how the government runs, or how our taxpayer funds are used, but we’re being forced to pay through the nose, anyhow.

We have no real say, but that doesn’t prevent the government from fleecing us at every turn and forcing us to pay for endless wars that do more to fund the military industrial complex than protect us, pork barrel projects that produce little to nothing, and a police state that serves only to imprison us within its walls.

If you have no choice, no voice, and no real options when it comes to the government’s claims on your property and your money, you’re not free.

It wasn’t always this way, of course.

Early Americans went to war over the inalienable rights described by philosopher John Locke as thenatural rights of life, liberty and property.

It didn’t take long, however—a hundred years, in fact—before the American government was laying claim to the citizenry’s property by levying taxes to pay for the Civil War. As theNew York Timesreports, “Widespread resistance led to its repeal in 1872.”

Determined to claim some of the citizenry’s wealth for its own uses, the government reinstituted the income tax in 1894. Charles Pollock challenged the tax as unconstitutional, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in his favor. Pollock’s victory was relatively short-lived. Members of Congress—united in their determination to tax the American people’s income—worked together to adopt a constitutional amendment to overrule the Pollock decision.

On the eve of World War I, in 1913,Congress instituted a permanent income taxby way of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution and the Revenue Act of 1913. Under the Revenue Act, individuals with income exceeding $3,000 could be taxed starting at 1% up to 7% for incomes exceeding $500,000.

It’s all gone downhill from there.

Unsurprisingly, the government has used its tax powers to advance its own imperialistic agendas and the courts have repeatedlyupheld the government’s power to penalizeor jail those who refused to pay their taxes.

While we’re struggling to get by, and making tough decisions about how to spend what little money actually makes it into our pockets after the federal, state and local governments take their share (this doesn’t include the stealth taxes imposed through tolls, fines and other fiscal penalties), the government continues to do whatever it likes—levy taxes, rack up debt, spend outrageously and irresponsibly—with little thought for the plight of its citizens.

To top it all off, all of those wars the U.S. is so eager to fight abroad are being waged with borrowed funds. AsThe Atlanticreports, “U.S. leaders are essentiallybankrolling the wars with debt, in the form of purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds by U.S.-based entities like pension funds and state and local governments, and by countries like China and Japan.”

Of course, we’re the ones who have to repay that borrowed debt.

For instance,American taxpayers have been forced to shell out more than $5.6 trillion since 9/11for the military industrial complex’s costly, endless so-called “war on terrorism.” That translates to roughly $23,000 per taxpayer to wage wars abroad, occupy foreign countries, provide financial aid to foreign allies, and fill the pockets of defense contractors and grease the hands of corrupt foreign dignitaries.

Mind you, that’s only a portion of what the Pentagon spends on America’s military empire.

The United States alsospends more on foreign aidthan any other nation, with nearly $300 billion disbursed over a five-year period. More than150 countries around the world receive U.S. taxpayer-funded assistance, with most of the funds going to the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Thatprice tag keeps growing, too.

AsForbesreports, “U.S. foreign aid dwarfs the federal funds spent by 48 out of 50 state governments annually.Only the state governments of California and New York spent more federal funds than what the U.S. sent abroad each year to foreign countries.”

Most recently, the U.S. hasallocated nearly $115 billion in emergency military and humanitarian aid for Ukrainesince the start of the Russia invasion.

As Dwight D. Eisenhowerwarnedin a 1953 speech, this is how the military industrial complex continues to get richer, while the American taxpayer is forced to pay for programs that do little to enhance our lives, ensure our happiness and well-being, or secure our freedoms.

This is no way of life.

Yet it’s not just the government’s endless wars that are bleeding us dry.

We’re also being forced to shell out money for surveillance systems to track our movements, money to further militarize our already militarized police, money to allow the government to raid our homes and bank accounts, money to fund schools where our kids learn nothing about freedom and everything about how to comply, and on and on.

There was a time in our history when our forebears said “enough is enough” and stopped paying their taxes to what they considered an illegitimate government. They stood their ground and refused to support a system that was slowly choking out any attempts at self-governance, and which refused to be held accountable for its crimes against the people. Their resistance sowed the seeds for the revolution that would follow."

2024-04-11 02:00:00,"""I Am Going To Lecture You On Climate Change"": BBC Reporter Gets Schooled For Hypocrisy",https://web.archive.org/web/20240411114920/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/i-am-going-lecture-you-climate-change-bbc-reporter-gets-schooled-hypocrisy#comment-stream,"Authored by Tilak K. Doshi via RealClear Politics,

On March 28, President Mohamed Irfaan Ali of the South American country of Guyana became an instant hero to many as he refused to take lectures on climate change from a BBC reporter during an interview.In a two-minutevideo clipthat went viral on X (formerly Twitter) and other social media, President Ali turned the tables on the BBC’s Stephen Sackur when the reporter accused Guyana of worsening the “climate crisis” by allowing the exploitation of its newly found oil and gas reserves.

“Over the next decade or two, it’s expected that there will be $150 billion worth of oil and gas extracted off your coast,” Sackur told the president. “It’s an extraordinary figure. But think of it in practical terms. That means – according to many experts – two billion tons of carbon emissions will come from your seabed from those reserves and released into the atmosphere.” Guyana’s head of state quickly rebutted: “Let me stop you right there. Did you know that Guyana has a forest that is the size of England and Scotland combined, a forest that stores 19.5 gigatons of carbon, a forest that we have kept alive?”

When the reporter asked President Ali whether the rainforest gave him the “right” to release the carbon, the Guyanese leader retorted: “Does that give you the right to lecture us on climate change?I’m going to lecture you on climate change.” Being lectured by the BBC on climate change is not a new development; it’s what the state-supported media service often does, and in hectoring tones. But is the BBC correct in its proclamations about what the “climate science” says?

'Stop Lecturing Us': Guyana President Shuts Down BBC Journalist, Exposes West's HypocrisyGuyanese President Mohammad Irfaan Ali had an heated exchange with a BBC journalist over climate change issue. The fiery exchange took place during BBC Hardtalk show, hosted by Stephen…pic.twitter.com/vZJuhvJ7MS

Climate Alarmists and Their Detractors

The BBC seemsinstitutionally committedto an alarmist position in its coverage of climate change issues. Many BBC programs seem driven to inject the “climate catastrophe” narrative into every energy-related news item. Stephen Sakur’s pointed remarks to Guyana’s president on the country’s rapid emergence as an oil and gas exporter were unexceptional in this regard.

The response on social media to the viral clip is telling. Here is a short selection from X on March 29 and 30:

Chris Rose(over 130,000 followers): “This is magnificent to watch. The President of Guyana truly put the BBC in its place. When sanctimony and pomposity meets [sic] sense and modesty.”

Simon Ateba(over 670,000 followers): “EXPLOSIVE: President Mohamed  Irfaan Ali (@presidentaligy) of Guyana obliterates @BBC journalist Stephen Sackur (@stephensackur) over climate change hypocrisy. ‘No, no, I’m not done yet!’ WATCH.”

Dilly Hussain(over 110,000 followers): “LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE!” An absolute masterclass shutdown by President Mohamed Irfaan Ali of Guyana when probed by @BBCHARDtalk’s Stephen Sackur on his country’s new found oil and gas fields and the West’s concerns about “carbon emissions”.

Visegrád 24(over 970,000 followers): “I am going to lecture you on climate change,” says Guyana President @presidentaligy to BBC journalist Stephen Sackur, as he pushes back against the journalist attempting to lecture the Caribbean leader about oil being bad for the environment.”

The headlines of leading newspapers on March 30 reflected these social media messages:

The Telegraph: “Watch: Guyana’s president scolds BBC presenter for climate change ‘lecture.’”

Times of India: “‘Are you in their pockets?’: Guyanese President calls out reporter for Western hypocrisy.”

Fox News: “Video of Guyana’s president snapping back at BBC reporter’s climate quiz goes viral: ‘Let me stop you.’”

Hypocrisy As the Default Option in Climate Change Narratives

What is of interest here is the inherently hypocritical nature of the interactions between representatives of developed countries and those of developing ones concerning energy and climate policies. Some of the most apparent of such interactions occur during the UN’s annual COP (“Conference of Parties”) climate summits.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres, never one to shy from hyperbolic pronouncements,warnsof a “code red for humanity. The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable.” Indeed,based on dubious “hockey-stick” global-warming models formulated in the West, the secretary-general proclaims the approach of the “era of global boiling.”

At COP26, held in 2021 in Glasgow, Western leaders addressed those making up 80% of humanity in speeches that reeked of carbon imperialism (here,here, andhere). Their message can be fairly summarized as follows:

We pledge climate finance to help you. There are promising new energy technologies to achieve our goals of net zero by 2050. The outlook for new jobs and economic growth are limitless with solar and wind power, electric vehicles, green hydrogen and carbon capture and sequestration. However, we must stop all new fossil fuel investments now! You must give up fossil fuels or else the planet is doomed.

Faced with the increasingly untenable hypocrisy of the Western elites discouraging fossil fuel use in the developing world, the pushback by leaders such as Guyana’s President Ali is no surprise. In 2015, the Indian government’s then-chief economic adviser Arvind Subramaniam spoke in no uncertain terms of a newcarbon imperialism: “The rich world’s move against fossil fuels is a disaster for India, and other poorer countries.”

In the lead-up to COP27 held in Sharm Al Sheikh, Egypt in 2022, Africa’s top energy official, Amani Abou-Zeid, the African Union Commissioner for Infrastructure and Energy,saidthatAfrican countries will push for “a common energy position that sees fossil fuels as necessary to expanding economies and electricity access.”

At the COP28 climate summit held in Dubai, UAE, Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, president of the summit and CEO of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company,rebutted questionsfrom Mary Robinson, a former UN special envoy for climate change: “There is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5 C [maximum global temperature increase].” In an interview, hesaidthat “You’re asking for a phase-out of fossil fuels . . . Please, help me, show me the roadmap for a phase-out of fossil fuel that will allow for sustainable socio-economic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves.”

That’s Enough Already!

Germany, the world leader in green energy ambitions, provides the best lesson of untenable hypocrisy when faced with the real-world constraints of physics and economics. In 2022, the country faced the prospect of entering winter without adequate energy supplies. It had shut down its nuclear power plants and lost access to piped Russian natural gas by imposing sanctions against Moscow (which was then followed by the sabotage of the Nordstream pipeline). In this context, Germany quickly retreated to coal power generation, and it now plansto double its gas-fired power-generating capacity.

According toDoomberg, an energy and finance consultancy, Germany moved back to coal “with the speed and efficiency of the British evacuation of Dunkirk.” The IEA, the institution most responsible for the West’s clarion calls tostop fossil fuel investments, noted that Germany’s “significant reversal” drove European coal consumption up 9% in 2022. Energy security and the need to heat homes and keep lights on and factories humming trumped virtue-signaling climate goals – and Germany’s abject hypocrisy is obvious to many leaders in the developing world.

Guyana’s President Irfaan Ali has little to explain, much less apologize for, as his country rapidly emerges as an important South American exporter of hydrocarbons. Let the BBC’s reporters peddle theirluxury beliefsto those who think they can afford them.

2024-04-11 02:45:00,German Troops In 'Line Of Fire': First Foreign Deployment Since WW2,https://web.archive.org/web/20240411114920/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/germany-sends-troops-lithuania-1st-permanent-foreign-deployment-ww2#comment-stream,"This week Germany has begun deploying troops tothe Baltic state of Lithuania, which marks the first such external deployment of its kind for Germany's military since World War II—and which is the result of Berlin adopting a firmer 'counter-Russia' posture after more than two years of war in Ukraine.

While merely two dozen soldiers have reportedly arrived Lithuania thus far, the German contingent will bestationed there permanently. Currently Germany leads a NATO deployment in Lithuania of some 1,000 troops, but which is temporary.

""This is the first time that we have permanently stationed such a unit outside of Germany,""German Defense Minister Boris Pistoriussaidduring a ceremony seeing the troops depart from Berlin. He hailed it as ""an important day for the German army.""

Crucially, and sure to trigger deep alarm for Moscow, the permanent German force in Lithuania isslated to grow to 4,800by the year 2027.

German military leadership is touting this as in direct response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and'aggression':

Russia's invasion of Ukraine is prompting Germany to do something unprecedented — topermanently base thousands of troops only about 100 kilometers from the border with Russiaandright in the line of fireif the Kremlin ever launches an attack on NATO territory.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius was in Vilnius on Monday to sign a deal with his Lithuanian counterpart Arvydas Anušauskas firming up the conditions on which 4,800 German troops plus 200 civilians will be based in the Baltic country.

""With this war-ready brigade, we are assuming a leadership responsibility here in the alliance and on NATO's eastern flank,""Pistoriussaid, adding: ""The speed of the project clearly shows that Germany understood the new security reality.""

What is alarming for the significant risk of direct escalation between Russia and NATO with this new German deployment is the geography of this Baltic neighborhood: Lithuaniashares a border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.

This puts a permanent deployment of troops from a NATO country directly on Russia's borders. Additionally, Lithuania also borders Belarus, which forms a 'Union state' with Russia and currently hosts Russian tactical nuclear weapons. All of this comes as France's Macron has been talking up the possibility of sending Western troops directly to Ukraine.

Germany has already sent Leopard 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine, which have by many accounts done nothing to sway the momentum of the battle in Kiev's favor. Instead, Russia has in the recent past published footage purporting to show several German-supplied tanksdisabled and destroyed, burning on the battlefield.

The European Parliament has approved the controversial EU Asylum and Migration Pact, which will see countries forced to accept their fair share of new arrivals into the bloc or pay a fine for every migrant they reject.

The new asylum and migration package was passed largely with votes from lawmakers affiliated with the European People’s Party, the Socialists and Democrats (S&D), and Renew Europe, with MEPs being urged to swallow their criticisms of the scheme and vote for the compromise legislation.

“History made,”tweeted European Parliament President Roberta Metsola as she praised what she described as a “robust legislative framework on how to deal with migration and asylum,” noting it had been “10 years in the making” but the EU had kept its word.

Some MEPs on both the left and the center-right revealed they voted through the pact despite its many flaws.

“The new legislation is not perfect but we can only make migration manageable and humane with one European solution,”said Hilde Vautmans, foreign affairs coordinator for Renew Europe.

Nationalist politicians across Europe expressed their anger at the passing of the pact, which they claim cedes sovereignty to an ever-centralized European Union.

“The Migration Pact organizes the tutelage and control of nations, the legal impunity of NGOs complicit with smugglers,”tweeted Marine Le Pen of France’s National Rally.

She further vowed to “put an end to the accelerated pursuit of policies to encourage and organize mass immigration,”on June 9 at the EU elections in which her party is expected to win the most French seats.

Le Pacte des migrations organise la mise sous tutelle et sous contrôle des nations, l’impunité juridique des ONG complices des passeurs. Le 9 juin, nous mettrons fin à la poursuite accélérée des politiques d’incitation et d’organisation de l’immigration massive.

In the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote, Le Pen’s party leader Jordan Bardella confirmed that those within the Identity and Democracy (ID) parliamentary group would be voting down the legislation.

🇫🇷🇪🇺🔥 ""Countries will be forced to welcome thousands of migrants into their towns and villages or pay dearly to be spared!""France's National Rally President@J_Bardellaslams the EU's proposed#MigrationPactand says European people do not want to be ""replaced or submerged.""pic.twitter.com/yEzDGwUkHP

“Countries will be forced to welcome thousands of migrants into their towns and villages or pay dearly to be spared!”Bardella told the chamber, warning that Brussels wants to redistribute new arrivals while nationalist politicians want to “send them back.”

After the vote, Bardella took to social media to denounce the “terrible European Migration Pact” that seeks to “impose the distribution of migrants in our municipalities under penalty of financial sanctions.”

Voting was briefly suspended on Wednesday evening due to a protest from inside the chamber from left-wing activists who urged those of their political persuasion to vote down the bill on humanitarian grounds.

“This Pact kills, vote ‘No!'”they chanted from the observation rooms as they threw paper airplanes down into the auditorium.

🇪🇺‼️ BREAKING: ""This Pact kills, vote 'No!'""Protesters disrupt the European Parliament chamber during a voting session on the Asylum and Migration Pact, throwing paper airplanes down on lawmakers and demanding the bill be rejected.pic.twitter.com/sL6c2vsLzr

The Hungarian government reiterated its opposition to the pact following the vote with spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs citing Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó who “declared that regardless of any migration pact adopted by the European Parliament, Hungary will maintain its legal and physical border barriers and will not allow illegal immigrants entry, opposing the pro-war and pro-migration stance of Brussels’ leadership.”

The majority of lawmakers who passed through the pact were lukewarm on its contents but considered it to be a compromise to end the status quo existing in a Europe plagued by illegal immigration.The argument on the left is that it goes too far in targeting illegal migrants, while those on the right consider it to be yet another sovereignty grab that will do little to solve the crisis.

The facility came under drone attack this Sunday, withboth Russia and Ukraine blaming each other for the strikeswhich caused “superficial scorching” at one location but with structural integrity seemingly not being compromised.

As Statista's Martin Armstriong reports,Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, warned:

“Such reckless attacks significantly increase the risk of a major nuclear accident and must cease immediately"".

Besides the great concern regarding the ongoing risk of a disaster occurring at the site, there is also a fundamental problem facing Ukraineso long as reactors are shut down, off the grid or under Russian control.

You will find more infographics atStatista

As this infographic shows,nuclear power contributed to Ukraine's electricity generation more than any other source,with 76 million megawatt hours produced in 2020 - ahead of fossil fuels and a long way in front of renewable sources.

Zaporizhzhia's full capacity also puts it far ahead of other plants in the country.

Drones from American startups areglitchy and expensiveprompting Ukraine to turn to alternatives from China.

The Wall Street Journal commentsAmerican Drones Failed to Turn the Tide in Ukraine

The Silicon Valley company Skydio sent hundreds of its best drones to Ukraine to help fight the Russians. Things didn’t go well.Skydio’s drones flew off course and were lost, victims of Russia’s electronic warfare. The company has since gone back to the drawing board to build a new fleet.

Most small drones from U.S. startups have failed to perform in combat, dashing companies’ hopes that a badge of being battle-tested would bring the startups sales and attention. It is also bad news for the Pentagon, which needs a reliable supply of thousands of small, unmanned aircraft.

“The general reputation for every class of U.S. drone in Ukraine is that they don’t work as well as other systems,”Skydio Chief Executive Adam Bry said,calling his own drone “not a very successful platform on the front lines.”

Ukrainian officials have found U.S.-made drones fragile and unable to overcome Russian jamming and GPS blackout technology. At times, they couldn’t take off, complete missions or return home. American drones often fail to fly at the distances advertised or carry substantial payloads.

Ukraine has found ways to get tens of thousands of drones as well as drone parts from China. The military is using off-the-shelf Chinese drones, primarily from SZ DJI Technology.

The U.S. has called DJI a Chinese military company and a surveillance tool for Beijing, which DJI denies. The Pentagon banned DJI drones in the U.S. military, and congressional legislation would ban new DJI products in the U.S.

Skydio employees went back to Ukraine 17 times to get feedback, Bry said.Its new drone is built around Ukraine’s military needs and feedback from public-safety agencies and other customers, he said, rather thanU.S. Defense Department requirements that are sometimes divorced from battlefield realities.

I suspect China is selling drones and drone parts to both Ukraine and Russia. What a racket.

Meanwhile, US drones made to US Defense Department specs are garbage.

2024-04-11 05:45:00,Will The Used Rolex Price Bottom Hold With Fed Pivot 'Likely' Delayed?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240411114920/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/will-used-rolex-price-bottom-hold-now-fed-pivot-likely-delayed,"We first put the secondary market for Rolex and Patek Philippe timepieces on bottom watch (read:here) in December 2023, after the Federal Reserve announced the interest rate hiking cycle was nearing an end. In mid-March, we asked the question:Did The Used Rolex Watch Market Finally Bottom?

After five months of stabilization, theBloomberg Subdial Watch Index, which tracks prices for the 50 most-traded watches by value on the secondary market, continues to find a temporary floor between $33,800 and $33,500. The index fell .1% to $33,558 in March. It slid 8.7% in a year and plunged 42% in two years.

Among a handful of outperformers in March, the Rolex GMT Master II with a ceramic blue and red bezel gained 3.2% to trade at $20,935, according to the index. Nicknamed the ""Pepsi,"" the watch has been among the top performers in the past year amid speculation it might be discontinued, although it remains in the collection.

The Rolex Submariner with a green bezel, black dial and date complication nicknamed the ""Starbucks,"" gained about 1% in March to trade at $15,259, the data shows.

Meanwhile, the Patek Philippe Nautilus 5711 with a blue dial, a steel sports model with an integrated bracelet that was one of the so-called 'hype' watches during the peak of the market, gained about 1.1% last month to trade at about $98,753.

Demand for luxury has cooled over the last two years. Luxury has plunged into turmoil because of soaring borrowing rates, which are hammering demand for watches, purses, and jewelry.

Today's news ofhotter consumer pricesin the US could complicate matters for the Fed and possibly postpone the first interest rate cut to the second half of the year.

Implied interest rate swaps show less than two cuts are being priced in for the year, down from 7 in early January.

With interest rate cuts likely being delayed this summer to fall, if not after, higher for longer could delay recovery in used luxury watch prices and or send prices even lower.

""The desire of gold is not for gold. It is for the means of freedomand benefit.""

- Ralph Waldo Emerson

Gold is now in a hurry and silver even more so.

The price moves in the coming months and year are likely to be spectacular. The combination of technical and fundamental factors can easily drive gold well above $3,000 and silver to new highs above $50.

Forecasting gold is a mug’s game, as I have often stated.

But that is in the short term.

In the medium to long term,forecasting the Gold price is a cinch.

How can I be so certain?

Well, since the history of gold and money began, gold has always increased in value measured against fiat money.

Voltaire gave us the formula in 1729 when he said:

So why has no investor or layman ever heeded the simple fact that –

What most people, including experienced investors, don’t understand is that gold doesn’t  increase in value.

Gold just maintains stable purchasing power. A Roman toga 2000 years ago cost 1 ounce of gold and a tailored suit today also costs 1 ounce of gold.

So it is really totally wrong to talk about gold going up when it is the unit we measure gold in that goes down. Just as all fiat money has done

Just take gold measured in US dollars. As the illustration below shows, the value of the dollar since 1971 has crashed, measured in real terms which is gold.

As the picture shows, 1 ounce of gold cost $35 in 1971. Today 53 years later 1 ounce of gold costs $2,300. So has gold increased in value 66x since 1971?

No of course not, it is the dollar which has declined in value and purchasing power by 98.5% since 1971.

So what will gold be worth in the next 5 years? That is of course the wrong question.

Instead we must ask how much will the dollar and all currencies decline in real terms in the next few years?

Gold and silver have not increased in line with money supply or inflation and are severely undervalued.

Just look at gold adjusted for US CPI (Consumer Price Index) in the graph below.

So if we inflation adjust the gold price,the 1980 high at $850 would today be $3,590.

But if we adjust the gold price for REAL inflation based on Shadow Government Statistics calculation,the gold price equivalent of  the $850 high would today be $29,200.

In the 1980s the inflation calculation was adjusted, by the US government, to artificially improve/reduce official inflation figures.

And if we adjust the silver price for US CPI,the 1980 silver high of $50 would today be $166.

Adjusted for REAL inflation,the $50 high silver in 1980 would today be $1,350.

Gold makes powerful moves and then goes sideways for long periods. After the gold explosion from $35 in 1971 to $850 in 1980, gold spent 20 years correcting until 2000.

That was the time that we decided that gold was now ready for the next run at the same time as risk in stock markets, debt and derivatives was starting to look dangerous.

So in 2002 we made major investments into physical gold at $300 for investors and for ourselves. At the time I recommended up to 50% of financial assets into gold based on wealth preservation principles and also the fact that gold at the time was unloved and oversold and thus represented excellent value.

As gold went through $2,100 in early March, I declared“GOLD – WE HAVE LIFTOFF!”

Since then gold has moved up another $200 but that is the mere beginning of a secular move.

After the move from $300 in 2002 to $1920 in 2011 gold had a long correction again between 2013 and 2016. The break of the first Maginot Line (see chart) was predictable(article Feb 2019). Then in March 2023 it was clear that the second Maginot Line would break and we were seeing the beginning of the demise of the financial system as four US banks and Credit Suisse collapsed within a mater of days.

I discussed this in my March 2023 article“THIS IS IT! THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS TERMINALLY BROKEN”

The message I want to convey with the two graphs above is that gold investing requires patience and obviously timing of the entry points. But in the long term investors will be extravagantly rewarded and at the same time hold the best insurance against a rotten system that money can buy.

Gold has consolidated under $2,000 since August 2020. The recent breakout is extremely important and not the end of a move.

No, this is the beginning of a move that will reach heights that today are unfathomable.

I am in no way intending to be sensational, but just trying to explain that fundamental and technical factors are now pointing to a secular bull market in gold and silver.

Also, normal measures of overbought will not be valid. Gold and silver will in the coming months be overbought for long periods of time.

But don’t forget that there will also be vicious corrections, especially in silver which is not for widows and orphans.

I want to emphasise again that our intention to invest heavily in gold and much less heavily in silver (much more volatile), was primarily for long term wealth preservation reasons. That reason is more valid than ever today.

Since we have been expecting the “Everything Bubble” to turn into the“Everything Collapse” (see my article April 2023), all the bubble assets like stocks, bonds and property are likely to decline substantially in real terms which means measured in gold.

I willingly admit that I have been premature in predicting the Everything Bubble to collapse in nominal terms. But in real terms almost all major asset classes have underperformed gold since 2000 including stocks.

It is only the illusion of growth and prosperity based on worthless money creation that keeps this circus travelling on. But the circus acts will soon run out of tricks as the world discovers that this is only a mirage which has totally deluded us.

If we take stocks as an example, gold has outperformed the Dow and S&P since 2,000.

Hers is what I wrote 2 weeks ago:

Gold has gone up 7.5X this century

Gold Compound annual return since 2000 is9.2%

Dow Jones Compound annual return since 2000 is7.7%incl. reinvested dividends

So why are only 0.6% of global financial assets in gold?"
2024-04-11 06:55:00,"Russia Bombards Ukraine With Hypersonic Missiles & Drones, Damaging Power Plants, NatGas Facilities",https://web.archive.org/web/20240411114920/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/russia-bombards-ukraine-hypersonic-missiles-drones-damaging-power-plants-natgas,"Russia launched a major missile and suicide drone offensive on Thursday, bombarding Ukraine's power grid and underground natural gas storage sites.

Bloombergreports Russia air-launched six hypersonic Kinzhal missiles that hit critical infrastructure near Kyiv and a region around western Ukraine's biggest city, Lviv. Ukraine's air defense system was not able to intercept the hypersonic missiles. However, 18 out of 42 more traditional and slower Russian missiles were downed, and only one of 40 drones.

In a Facebook post, Energy Minister German Galushchenko wrote that power plants near Kyiv, the Kharkiv region in the east, Zaporizhzhia in the south, and Lviv in the west were damaged. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Telegram that a power plant was damaged in Odesa.

A person familiar with one of the strikes toldBloombergthat six missiles hit the Trypilska plant south of Kyiv, the largest power plant in the region.

Footage of the destroyed Trypilska plant was posted on X.

Russia also targeted two of Ukraine's underground NatGas sites during the attack, according to a post on Telegram by Naftogaz Ukrainy, the largest national oil and gas company of Ukraine.

The operator of the underground storage site, Ukrtransgaz JSC, wrote on its website that the missile attack damaged the site's aboveground infrastructure.

Whileenergy traders are bracing for potential strikeson Israel by Iran or its proxies, which could ignite a regional war across the Middle East, Russia's intensified strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are likely the reason European NatGas futures are surging on Thursday, up nearly 7%—the highest in two weeks.

Meanwhile, some of the world's top traders and big banks on Wall Street are eying a possible return of $100 Brent crude.

""The current geopolitical environment continues to provide support to oil prices,"" said Warren Patterson, the head of commodities strategy for ING Groep NV in Singapore.

A combination of geopolitical tensions and OPEC+ supply cuts pushes crude prices higher, complicating the Federal Reserve's pivot asinflation reaccelerates. Higher energy prices could doom President Biden's election odds come November.

2024-04-11 07:20:00,The Passive Investor Problem,https://web.archive.org/web/20240411114920/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/passive-investor-problem,"WhenJohn Bogledied in 2019, people around the world mourned.Bogle created the Vanguard Group and made the index fund mainstream.Index funds are investment vehicles that invest in a class of investments as a whole, rather than trying to predict what specific stocks or securities will do best. So an investor could invest in an index fund that represented American companies as a whole rather than trying to predict whether Disney, Apple, or Meta would have a better quarter.

The theoretical advantage of these index funds is that they can theoretically offer diversification across many investments, exposure to most types of assets, and crucially offer lower fees by eschewing active management.

When he died, it wasestimatedthat by popularizing index funds rather than higher-fee mutual or hedge funds he had saved investors a trillion dollars in reduced fees.

The Vanguard Group has grown to be enormous with over$7 trillion in assets under management.

But as Vanguard and other similar groups have grown, a larger and larger share of most companies’ stock is held by funds that have little interest in the performance of any particular company.

If an investor bets big on Apple, that investor will have a good reason to carefully monitor Apple’s performance, carefully consider how to vote in shareholder elections, and serve as a watchdog on management because of their investments. With index funds, every investor can end up so diversified the performance of each company matters little to investors. It also means that a few investment companies can end up controlling a large or sometimes majority share of every major company.In 2019, theHarvard Business Reviewpointed out that “either Blackrock, Vanguard, or State Street is the largest shareholder in88%of S&P 500 companies.”

This common ownership discourages competition.

In a world where every company has different owners, every company competes to maximize its profits, often taking market share away from its competitors.But what if every company is largely owned by the same few institutional investors?A company that tries to maximize its profit- perhaps by cutting prices and saving consumers money- will also hurt the other companies that its investors also own. Shareholders may come to care about the profits of an industry as a whole rather than the profits of a particular firm, tacitly encouraging anti-competitive behavior.

It also means that ideological crusades can be driven by a few investment companies. It’s hard to imagine small firms going all in on DEI or ESG investments.What small family company wants to abandon hiring the best job candidates in the name of diversity or adopt unproven “green” practices in the name of sustainability?

But if a few investment managers become passionate about such trendy left-wing ideas they can rapidly disseminate through the market.

You might think that competition might winnow out ESG, but if fund managers force such practices on every major firm that suddenly becomes much less of a concern.

This problem is mainly, but not solely, an equities problem.

Bondholders never had a vote in shareholder elections but even so, they might prefer more invested and active shareholders to preserve the company whose debt they own.Other popular types of investments such as gold and other precious metals and real estate are less affected by the rapid rise of passive investing.

2024-04-11 07:48:13,ECB Preview: No Surprises Today With All Eyes On June,https://web.archive.org/web/20240411114920/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/ecb-preview-no-surprises-today-all-eyes-june#comment-stream,"The incoming data have been mixed since the March ECB meeting. While spot measures of growth have remained weak, the more forward-looking indicators have continued to improve. Inflation has come in broadly as expected in the March staff projections, with some measures of underlying inflation ticking up but wage growth slowing a bit more than anticipated.Today's meeting is therefore likely to be relatively uneventful:most economists expect the Governing Council to leave its key policy language broadly unchanged without formally pre-committing to a June cut. Instead, Lagarde is likely to reiterate that the Governing Council will have “a lot of data”in June to decide whether to lower policy rates.Also don't expect much if any additional color on the likely pace of rate cuts, with emphasis on data dependence

Separately,Lagarde will again emphasize that the ECB is independent of the Fed, which will be helpful for EUR/USD downside as Euro Area data are in a completely different place. And EUR has been in a 5 big figure range for most of the last 16 months or so, so there’s no obvious reason for them to be concerned about the currency. The key question is whether the data will continue to justify a faster pace as well.

Some more details courtesy ofNewsquawk

OVERVIEW:Analysts are unanimous in expecting the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 4.0% with markets assigning a circa 92% likelihood of such an outcome. Policymakers continue to guide participants towards a June reduction with even the likes of arch-hawk Holzmann falling into line with such an outcome. With the April decision itself seemingly a given, focus will naturally fall on any tweaks to the policy statement and any hints over forthcoming action. In terms of market pricing beyond April, June is fully priced for a 25bps reduction with a total of 83bps of loosening seen by year-end.

PRIOR MEETING:As expected the ECB opted to stand pat on rates as policymakers continued to monitor progress towards the Bank's inflation mandate. Furthermore, guidance on rates was reaffirmed as stating that ""rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary"". The accompanying macro projections saw 2024 and 2025 inflation forecasts lowered, leaving the latter matching the Bank's 2% target. At the follow-up press conference, Lagarde noted that the Bank is not yet ""sufficiently confident"" when it comes to meeting its target. In terms of the policy path beyond the March meeting, Lagarde stated the Bank will know a little more in April but a lot more in June. When it comes to the discussions held during the meeting, Lagarde stated that there was not a discussion over rate cuts but the GC has begun discussing dialling back its restrictive stance. Subsequent source reporting via Reuters noted that policymakers overwhelmingly favour June for the first rate cut, whilst some policymakers floated the idea of a second reduction in July to win over a small group still pushing for an April start.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS:Headline inflation in March pulled back to 2.4% from 2.6% with the supercore metric now below 3% for the first time in two years. That being said, services inflation remains uncomfortably high at 4%. The ECB's latest Consumer Inflation Expectations survey for February saw the 1yr-ahead projection slip to 3.1% from 3.3% whilst the 3yr ahead forecast held steady at 2.5%. In terms of market proxies, the EZ 5yr5yr inflation gauge has picked up to 2.32% from around 2.26% at the time of the last meeting. With Q1 GDP not released until 30th April, expectations for the bloc’s growth prospects have instead been guided by survey data which has seen the EZ March composite PMI climb into expansionary territory for the first time since June last year. The accompanying report noted that “expectations for business activity were at their most optimistic since February 2022 during March”. In the labour market, the unemployment rate remains at its historic low of 6.5%.

RECENT COMMUNICATIONS:Since the prior meeting, President Lagarde has continued to reaffirm her guidance from the March meeting that the GC will know a ""bit more by April and a lot more by June"", whilst noting that ""...we cannot wait until we have all the relevant information. To do so could risk being too late in adjusting policy."" Chief Economist Lane has stated that the Bank must avoid ""giving calendar guidance"" but is confident that wage growth is slowing as expected. The influential Schnabel has not given much in the way of clear policy guidance, however, other notable figures such as Villeroy of France have remarked that an ECB rate cut is ""very likely"" in Spring (describing Spring as April-June 21st). He also noted that the GC needs to take out insurance against a hard landing by starting to cut rates. At the dovish end of the spectrum, Stournaras of Greece put forward the view that the ECB should cut rates twice before the summer break, adding that four rate cuts this year ""seems reasonable"". In terms of the hawks on the GC, Austria's Holzmann cautioned that investors should consider the risk that the ECB does not lower rates this year, whilst at a later date noting that he has no in-principle objection to a June rate cut, but wants to see more supportive data.

RATES:Analysts are unanimous in expecting the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 4.0% with markets assigning a circa 92% likelihood of such an outcome. With the April decision itself seemingly a given, focus will naturally fall on any tweaks to the policy statement and any hints over forthcoming action. As a reminder, current guidance on rates notes ""... rates are at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to this goal"". ING suggests that the GC’s lightest-touch option for a change in communication would be to alter the existing ""confident"" inflation is falling but ""not sufficiently confident"" phraseology. Alternatively, the GC could explicitly declare an outright intention to cut rates at the June meeting (possibly with or without attached conditionality). In terms of market pricing beyond April, June is fully priced for a 25bps reduction with the next cut thereafter fully priced in September and a total of 83bps of loosening seen by year-end.

Finally, while the market is unlikely to move much due to the lack of surprises, here is the traditional market matrix reaction function courtesy of ING Economics.

2024-04-11 11:53:07,Is Someone Cornering The Gold Market Using Options?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-11/ross-norman-someone-cornering-gold-markets-using-options,"Strong inflation data yesterday afternoon prompted the dollar and 10 year treasury yields to rally, casting strong doubts about a June Fed rate cut ... and in a ""normal"" market gold would have corrected very sharply lower ... what did it do ?

Well essentially it ignored it.

Interestingly there was a blip lower suggesting someone has not yet the script that says that gold is now in a new paradigm. Get with it.

With US CPI coming in hot, gold dropped $30 and then immediately bounced even as the USD and yields sailed higher ... largely recovering its composure ... the gold buyer is clearly keen to hit the bid on any dips.

They say you best see the character of somebody from how they behaviour under adversity ... and arguably so it is for markets ... well the reading here is that the gold buyer behind this rally has real conviction.

A senior market colleague e-mailed me to say he disagreed with my own conviction that the rally is options based. I don't have a problem with that ... in fact that's the stuff of discourse. But I still take that view and am happy to be proven wrong ... not only have there been a series of cumulatively large bets to the upside ... but the delta hedging that goes with it is also market agnostic. And I am yet to hear a better explanation. SeeHERE

... and very few things are able to withstand market headwinds as gold is proving. A major sovereign state purchase perhaps might also be relatively oblivious to economic data - as gold is proving - but that would be unusual, especially as loco London vault stocks are unchanged (suggesting they did not want it posted to their home address) and the trades have not been booked through the LBMA benchmark - so an OTC trade.

The main takeaway here is that the rally remains resilient despite the data and the path of least resistance is higher ... hold onto your hats.

Israeli news website Ynet reported Thursday that ""Tehran decided to either delay the strike or change the nature of its response to Israel's attack on its consulate in Damascus,likely due to warnings from the administration of United States President Joe Biden. According to more:

The outlet cited Iranian semi-official news agency Mehr as claiming the attack could happen ""maybe tonight,"" but soon after deleting the video with the assertion.

The last 48 hours has seen Washington raise the possibility that it could intervene militarily in defense of Israel if Iran retaliates for the April 1st Israeli attack on its embassy in Damascus.

Meanwhile, some international airlines, most notably German airline Lufthansa,have paused their flights to Tehran, citing heightened fears of imminent military action in the region. Russia has also taken steps to warn its citizens against travel to the region, particularly Israel, as the region remains at boiling point.

Oil Priceunderscoresthat as the waiting game continues, anIran Strike Threat Hangs Over Inflation-Focused Oil Markets. The industry publication observes, ""Oil markets have not visibly responded to the threat hanging over the Middle East, withBrent crudeand West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trading down over 1% at 11:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday on inflation concerns that have led to speculation that the Federal Reserve may not implement a June rate cut.""

Israel's military believespreparation for major attack currently underway...

الجيش الإسرائيلي: إيران تحضر وكلاءها بالمنطقة لمهاجمتنا#العربية_عاجل

Iranian officials have signaled they are taking a path of strategic patience but that a significant response is still coming.

We previously reported that Iran now considers Israel's embassies and diplomatic sites abroad asessentially fair gamein the wake of Israel's April 1st airstrikes on Iran's embassy in Damascus, which killed two high-ranking IRGC generals and at least five others.

An analyst from theMiddle East Institute, Jason Brodsky, observedlast weekthat ""There are reports Iran's regime may beeyeing hitting an Israel diplomatic compound in a third country via drones & missiles. Israel maintains embassies in Bahrain; UAE; Jordan; Egypt; Azerbaijan; & Turkey. I would keep an eye on Jordan.""

Russia's Foreign Ministry had underscored in reacting to the Israeli strike on the Iranian consular compound ""the inviolability of which isguaranteed by the relevant Vienna Conventions, to be categorically unacceptable."" Indeed it was unprecedented for a nation's military to intentionally attack another state's sovereign embassy.Iran is outraged at the UN Security Council's silence.

Iran on Thursday is making noise over this at the UN Security Council in New York. Iran's permanent mission to the UN has blasted the council forfailing to condemn Israel’s ""reprehensible act of aggression""on Iran’s diplomatic premises in Syria. Al Jazeera reports the Iranian ambassador's fresh statementas follows:

It said in a statement on X that if the perpetrators had been brought to justice,""the imperative for Iran to punish this rogue regime [Israel] might have been obviated.""

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and other top officials have promised retaliation for theattackon the consulate building that killed members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including two generals.

So Iran is now saying that in light of UN inaction, which has not so much resulted in verbal censure of Israeli actions,it will be 'forced' to respond militarily.

All of this could spark a major war in the Middle East, possibly including US military intervention on behalf of Israel as well well, with President Biden havingjust promised""ironclad support""in defense of Israel. ""As I told Prime Minister Netanyahu, our commitment to Israel’s security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad,"" BidensaidWednesday. ""Let me say it again — ironclad. We’re going to do all we can to protect Israel’s security."" He explained this is in response toTehran ""threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel.""

IRAN🇮🇷 PREPARES TO STRIKE ISRAEL:According to The Intercept, Iran told the White House that if the US defends Israel against the coming retaliation strike for the Damascus Embassy bombing, then the United States will become a legitimate targetWhite House Middle East Czar…pic.twitter.com/x3Ze8PcCX8

Iran appears to be taking its time,waiting patiently while it plans a response. Israel has made very clear that any attack launched from Iranian soil will be met with a stronger response against the territory of the Islamic Republic. There are fresh reports saying Tehran has so far delayed its retaliation due to Washington threats that it will join Israel in hitting back against any strikes.

Below is commentary on what could happen nextsubmittedby Avi Melamed,a former Israeli intelligence officialwho went on to serve as deputy and then as senior Arab affairs adviser to Jerusalem Mayors Teddy Kollek and Ehud Olmert, operating as a negotiator during the first and second intifadas.

As the world braces for the Iranian response to the last week’s strike on Quds force commander Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, it’s likely Tehran is weighing the use of its proxies versus a direct strike.Iran’s proxy warfare strategy is a shield the regime uses to avoid direct retaliation.

This calculated and sophisticated tactic allows Tehran to continue its aggression through intermediaries without facing any consequences. The ongoing assaults orchestrated by Iranian proxies underscore the regime's influence — and ability — to shape the Middle Eastern geopolitical landscape but come at the cost of navigating local politics and civil strife. Iran’s largest proxy in the region is Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Since the start of Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza, Hezbollah has launched salvo after salvo of rockets against Israel’s evacuated northern communities. While rhetoric would point to Hezbollah escalating to the point of a full-fledged war on Israel’s northern border,it has yet to target Haifa or significant Israeli infrastructure, a move that would launch a massive war between Israel and Hezbollah, likely triggering a dissolution of Lebanon through a civil war, which Hezbollah would need to allocate resources to fighting in addition to its battles with Israel.

Most recently a senior coordinator for the Hezbollah-rival and Christian-affiliated Lebanese Forces, Pascal Suleiman, was kidnapped in Lebanon and his body was found in Syria. While the official statement is that the attack was prosecuted by “car thieves,” all signs seem to point to Hezbollah involvement.

#BREAKING:@ynetnews: Iran postponed an attack against Israel at the last minute due to American warnings, but it is still expected

Syria is the second Achilles heel that Tehran must consider. Any attack by a proxy force could be countered by an Israeli response that threatens or collapses Assad’s regime and with it the Iranian land corridor from Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon and ultimately to the Mediterranean. Finally, Tehran must consider the potential response that would be triggered by a direct attack on Israel.

On X, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz threatened very clearly today that “If Iran attacks from its own territory, Israel will respond and attack in Iran.” Even with Katz’s statement, there is no guarantee that Israel will continue to dance to the tune of Iran and its proxy model, and any future attack launched by Iran or its proxies could ultimately trigger a direct response against the Iranian homeland.

UN Security Council Fails to Condemn Damascus StrikeThe US, Britain & France on Wednesday opposed a Russian-drafted U.N. Security Council statement condemnING an attack on Iran’s embassyhttps://t.co/x540vQdOkDvia@observesyriapic.twitter.com/PW5FDWipfG

While the world sits on edge waiting for the inevitable Iranian response, it's important to note that the regimehas thus far acted strategically, that it will respond in order to send a message of strength and restore its deterrence capacity, but that it will do so at the time it calculates will best achieve its successful return of deterrence.”

2024-04-11 20:00:00,"Ford Lightning Price Cut ""Sends Shockwaves Through EV Market""",https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/ford-lightning-price-cuts-sends-shockwaves-through-ev-market#comment-stream,"Shares of Rivian Automotive, Lucid Group, and Tesla Motors moved lower during the cash session in the US after Ford Motor announced price cuts for its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck amid concerns about sliding demand across the EV industry. Meanwhile, an EV price war between the automakers rages on as unprofitable EV startups struggle to survive.

Let's begin with aBloombergreport that says Ford is reducing the price of its Lightning pickup truck by up to 7.5%. Earlier this year, the companypaused productionof the truck and is set to resume production later in the month

The largest price cut is on the Flash extended-range model, where customers could expect to save $5,500. The model now starts at around $67,995. Ford told Bloomberg that price cuts will help it ""adapt to the market to achieve the optimal mix of sales growth and customer value.""

The downshift in EV demand has led Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley to reevaluate Ford's EV strategy by reducing spending on battery-powered vehicles by $12 billion, delaying the launch of various models, and beginning to offer an expanded lineup on gas-electric hybrid propulsion vehicles across North America.

Thousands of auto dealers nationwiderecently warnedthe 'climate change warriors' in the White House: the 2030 EV push is backfiring.

""Currently, there are many excellent battery electric vehicles available for consumers to purchase. These vehicles are ideal for many people, and we believe their appeal will grow over time. The reality, however, is that electric vehicle demand today is not keeping up with the large influx of BEVs arriving at our dealerships prompted by the current regulations. BEVs are stacking up on our lots,"" the dealers said.

They warned: ""Already, electric vehicles are stacking up on our lots which is our best indicator of customer demand in the marketplace.""

Many consumers do not embrace the government's and corporate America's forced EV adoption schemes. This is now entirely backfiring, as evenTesla's first-quarter deliveries laggedbehind expectations, which may indicate more price cuts are coming.

""Reports of Ford reducing prices for the F-150 Lightning EV are sending shockwaves through the EV market, particularly affecting Rivian and Lucid,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man said.

Man said, ""Both startups are facing challenges that could be exacerbated by another round of EV price cuts, potentially eroding their profit margins and cash reserves at a time when they need to conserve cash.""

Shares of Rivian dropped the most, down 6.5% in early afternoon trade. Shares of Lucid were down around 2.5%, and Tesla was flat on the session.

Recall analyst Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley recentlysuggested consolidationis coming to the industry:

What a turbulent time for the EV space... Someone tell Biden to tell Powell ... moar rate cuts, please, to reflate the imploding green bubble.

2024-04-11 20:25:00,ATF Wants Funding For Data Analysts To Gather Gun Trace Information,https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/atf-wants-funding-data-analysts-gather-gun-trace-information,"Authored by Michael Clements via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) wants more funding, personnel, and technology, along with Universal Background Checks, to combat gun trafficking.

The agency included the wish list inVolume IIIof a four-part report, “National Firearms Commerce and Trafficking Assessment: Firearms Trafficking Investigations.”

According to the report, the agency is hobbled by unwieldy databases, outdated processes, and a lack of full-time employees to track firearms from their first point of sale to the time they turn up at crime scenes.

Second Amendment advocates counter that the agency has restrictions on it that prevent it from building a registry of firearms. They say the ATF should be more focused on crime than politics.

“All the federal government needs to do is prosecute those who break these laws,” Randy Kozuch, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) said in an email to The Epoch Times.

An ATF spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

The report draws data from 9,708 ATF firearm trafficking investigations conducted between 2017 and 2021, according to a statement on the ATF webpage.

It found nearly230,000 trafficked guns in 7,779 cases between 2017 and 2021. On average, 16 firearms were found per investigation—almost 60 percent of the cases involved five or fewer guns, gun parts, or regulated accessories.

Dealing firearms without a license was the most common trafficking-related crime reported. This has become something of a hot-button issue for Second Amendment advocates.

Gun rights advocates who spoke with The Epoch Times dismissed the report as evidence that the ATF has been weaponized.They claim that President Joe Biden is pushing an anti-gun agenda by using the ATF to bludgeon legal gun owners and federally licensed dealers (FFLs).

Aidan Johnston, Director of Federal Affairs for Gun Owners of America (GOA), said the ATF’s data belies the agency’s true intention. He pointed to the five or fewer firearms uncovered in the majority of the agency’s investigations.

At the same time, less than one percent of the cases involved 251 or more guns. But those cases accounted for almost 59 percent of the firearms trafficked between 2017 and 2021. Mr. Johnson believes that many cases involve honest FFLs caught up in the ATF’s zero-tolerance policy.

“They’re actually investigating normal people who sold five guns or less, when they really should be targeting the people they only target one percent of the time,” Mr. Johnston told The Epoch Times.

“They should not be targeting the people who work in good faith with the ATF.”

Alan Gottlieb, founder and executive vice president of the Second Amendment Foundation, agrees with Mr. Johnston.

He says the data can’t be trusted because it’s based on sample data. This fact, combined with what he considers the politicization of the ATF under President Biden, makes the report suspect.

“It’s hard to trust anything they say,”Mr. Gottlieb told The Epoch Times.

The report states that the ATF’s current information-gathering system was designed for investigators, not data analysts. If the agency were adequately funded and had full-time analysts, it could provide more accurate and comprehensive reports.

“Building this functionality into ATF’s data systems is a public safety imperative; it is necessary to enable ATF to provide timely, accurate, and actionable information and analysis to [provide information] on trends and threats posed by firearm trafficking,” the report reads.

Mr. Johnston scoffed at the idea of increased funding for the ATF. He claims the agency can’t be trusted with the data it has.

By federal law, the ATF is required to destroy much of the data it gathers on legal firearm owners. This is to prevent it from building a registry of firearms.

According to the Congressional Research Service, this has not stopped the agency from amassing millions of records from FFLs over the years.

A February 2024 report by the Service stated that in November 2021, the ATF reported having 921 million records from FFLs that had gone out of business. Mr. Johnston believes the agency has only gathered more records since 2021.

“They’ve already built an illegal registry. I don’t support giving an extra dime to this agency,” Mr. Johnston said.

The report listed crimes the ATF is dedicated to fighting, including providing false information to an FFL, which often occurs when a legal buyer purchases a gun for a prohibited person. This is the so-called straw purchase.

Another crime mentioned in the report is being a felon in possession of a firearm,which is often the result of a straw purchase.

According to the report, trafficked firearms were reportedly connected to almost 19 percent of aggravated assaults, 11 percent of homicide cases, and more than 9 percent of attempted homicides.

About 60 percent of those found with trafficked firearms were convicted felons. Almost half, 48 percent, were between 25 and 34 years old.

“ATF recognizes the role firearms play in violent crimes and pursues an integrated regulatory and enforcement strategy.Investigative priorities focus on armed violent offenders and career criminals, narcotics traffickers, narco-terrorists, violent gangs, and domestic and international arms traffickers,” the online statement reads.

Mr. Kozuch said nothing is currently stopping the ATF from fighting crime.

“ATF’s own data undermines its conclusions that new laws are needed, but it’s unsurprising that the Biden Administration’s ATF would use any opportunity to push more gun control,” Mr. Kozuch’s statement reads.

Mr. Johnston agreed. He said the report makes clear what the ATF sees as its primary mission.

“They’re not here to crack down on crime; they’re here to crack down on the Second Amendment,” he said.

2024-04-11 20:27:26,Our Two New George Floyds Received Stealth Reparations Too,https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-11/new-george-floyds-received-stealth-reparations-too,"In a post earlier this year (""America's Stealth Reparations""), we shared a remarkable thread by ""Confirmed Miscer"" on X about the COVID-era Payroll Protection Program:

As we enter Black History Month, we can expect further calls for reparations by the U.S. government to African Americans, but as an extraordinary thread on X this week detailed, we already had reparations for enterprising African Americans during COVID.

2024-04-11 20:38:31,Fiscal dominance is here. What is it exactly?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-11/fiscal-dominance-here-what-it-exactly,"If you find the post below informative,consider subscribing to our weekly newsletter.Each issue features the same type of in-depth analysis and thought-provoking content, ensuring you stay up-to-date on the latest developments in geopolitics, finance, and more.

American fiscal policy now features permanent deficits due to mandatory spending rather than temporary economic downturns.

Lyn Aldencalls it""Fiscal Dominance."" Dominic Pinocalls it""Deficits Forever.""

This shift renders traditional notions of fiscal prudence, where budgets are balanced across business cycles, an idea of the past. Since 2002, the government has consistently run deficits, regardless of economic conditions, with projections indicating no reversal in this trend.

At the heart of this predicament is mandatory spending, including entitlements and interest on the debt, which consumes the majority of the budget. This spending, immune to annual legislative adjustments, is on autopilot, limiting discretionary spending and Congress's ability to influence the budget.

The implications are dire: a future where interest payments devour most, if not all, federal revenue, placing the U.S. in a fiscal straitjacket.

This reality undermines economic sovereignty and burdens generations with unsustainable debt.

Nobody is coming to save us; it is up to individuals to protect themselves from the impending financial crisis.

The time for action is now, as the consequences of inaction grow more severe with each passing day.

The Securities Regulatory Commission of Hong Kongis set to acceleratethe approval of four spot bitcoin ETFs by April 15. This move, aligning with global trends and increasing institutional interest as evidenced by the U.S. spot ETF inflows, will generate demand as new groups of retail investors can access exposure to bitcoin’s price.

Core CPI and overall CPIexhibited significant annualized increasesin March, marking the worst inflation in a year for core CPI and since November 2022 for overall CPI. The return of inflation is thought to be driven by persistent inflation in core services despite slight declines in durable goods prices and relatively stable (but high) food prices. This new data dashed the Federal Reserve's hopes to significantly decrease interest rates. Investorsnow expectonly two rate cuts this year, down from as high as six at the beginning of the year.

Much of the increase in asset valuations from the past year has been driven by expected interest rate cuts. Since inflation keeps rising, it’s challenging for the Fed to sustain this trend. And, although the Fed is supposedly apolitical, the agency will likely bow to political pressure and put its thumb on the scale to keep the current regime in power, given the unpredictability of what a second Trump term would entail.

In an event that is both remarkable and not at all surprising, President Biden took to his podium to put pressure on the Fed to juice the economy before the election.

""Before the year is out there’ll be a rate cut.”US President Biden stands by his prediction that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates by the end of the year, despite a new report showing stubbornly high inflationhttps://t.co/hl385oGxAopic.twitter.com/0JhjjeqlI1

Anotherbitcoin halving,in which the block reward is halved ever four years, is set to occur next week. Despite expectations of significant declines following previous bitcoin halvings, the upcoming halvingis anticipatedto result in a modest decrease in hash rate of between 3% and 10%. Bitcoin's high dollar exchange rate and recent technological advancements in mining equipment suggest that, after the halving, we can expect a swift recovery of hashrate and growth thereafter.

Analysts predict a surge in bitcoin's post-halving dollar exchange rate,with Bitfinex forecasting a 160% increase targeting a range of $150,000 to $169,000.

Learn one key idea about bitcoin each week. This week:

A key component of bitcoin is how it is issued or distributed. Central to this process is theHalving.

Every ten minutes, someonemining bitcoinsuccessfully orders a set of transactions and adds them to the blockchain. They are rewarded with freshly minted bitcoin in return for their expenditure of energy.

The amount bitcoin that is rewarded per block remains consistent for four years at a time. However, every four years, the amount of bitcoin that a miner receives for successfully solving a block cuts in half – knows as the Halving.

This halving mechanism is integral to bitcoin’sdisinflationarymonetary policy. Imagine that every four years, the amount of new gold that miners are able to pull out of the ground is cut in half. Would the value of the existing gold in the economy go down, or up?

The Halving serves a key purpose – it ensures a low, and eventually zero, inflation of the supply of bitcoin. Once all bitcoins have been mined, inflation will cease completely, and whatever bitcoin already exists is all that will be available to use. Even still, the amount of bitcoin in circulation will never “run out,” because even a small amount of bitcoin can be divided infinitely.

When the Bitcoin Network began in 2009, miners received a reward of 50 bitcoins per block. In 2013, the first halving occurred, reducing the block reward to 25 bitcoins.

The mechanism has continued to operate as designed. Today, miners receive a reward of 6.25 bitcoins per block. The next halving, expected to take place next week, will reduce the reward further to 3.125 bitcoins per block.

This process will continue until all bitcoins have been mined. After approximately 34 halvings, new bitcoin issuance will cease, capping the total number of bitcoins in circulation at slightly less than 21 million. Current estimates place the final halving event in the year 2140.

Over 90% of bitcoins have already been mined. As the block reward diminishes with each halving event, miners will increasingly rely on transaction fees as the primary incentive for their work.

Following the final halving in 2140, miners will rely only on transaction fees to compensate them for the energy they spend to mine bitcoin. We have already seen a precursor to this phenomenon. At times when the number of bitcoin transactions is high, miners sometimesearn morefrom transaction fees than the block reward.

This trend indicates that the bitcoin ecosystem can sustain itself via transaction fees alone, ensuring its viability long after the last bitcoin has been mined.

There is nothing inherently magical about putting an asset 'on the blockchain'.Ah yes, tell me more about how revolutionary it is to have ownership of an asset that requires physical intermediation & legal adjudication on a 'decentralized' transparent global ledger.pic.twitter.com/UvtE86OX6h

Unfortunately for Powell, at least as far as the market is concerned, he has already lost the battle and the war.

According to a new basket introduced last week by Goldman Sachs, called simply theGS1970 Inflation Comeback basket(GSXU1970), traders are now rewarding stocks that would benefit from a return of the inflationary tsunami of the 1970s. In other words,the market is confident that a second, far more dangerous wave of inflation is about to be unleashed.

2024-04-11 21:15:00,How Ivermectin Trials Were Designed To Fail,https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/how-ivermectin-trials-were-designed-fail,"Authored by Yuhong Dong via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

The use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 is an ongoing debate.The central conflict is that while many doctors have reported success in using ivermectin,some studies published in major journals suggest it is in fact ineffective.

Even as the FDA recently has been removing misinformation it posted about ivermectin, the agency hasmaintainedits original position regarding its effectiveness, namely that there isn’t evidence.

People who trust ivermectin claim the studies showing ineffectiveness are fraudulent, while people who are skeptical of its use for treating COVID-19 view it as an anti-science conspiracy theory.

As a professional with decades of research experience conducting dozens of clinical trials on antiviral drugs, I decided to dive deep into the studies purporting ivermectin’s ineffectiveness. What I found shocked me.

Numerous preclinical studies have found that ivermectin has a broad range of effects on COVID-19, spanning from its initial impact on viral infection to the pathological changes the virus causes in our bodies.

Ivermectin inhibits the entire life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in our cells fromattachment,spreading, and replication (1,2,3).

Moreover,ivermectin isanti-inflammatoryandorgan-protective, which can potentially protect against severe COVID-relatedlung damageandacute respiratory distress syndrome,heart-relatedcomplications, andblood clots.

Ivermectin exceeds the approved antiviral effects of other medications, including Paxlovid, molnupiravir and remdesivir, which only target the virus and lack anti-inflammatory and organ-protective effects. Monoclonal antibodies have to be constructed specific to each variant and are very expensive.

In the pharmaceutical industry, clinical trials are commonly used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of drugs once their mechanism is demonstrated. There are two types of clinical trials: observational and interventional.

Observational studies are often conducted by doctors in clinical, hospital, or community settings to analyze the effects of drugs. The data is collected as observed in clinical practice with minimal interference.

Many doctors have observed the positive effects of ivermectin on their patients. An observational study conducted in Brazil with over 88,000 patients showed that ivermectinreducedthe rates of infection, mortality, and hospitalization by 49 percent, 92 percent, and 100 percent, respectively, compared to nonusers.

Pharmaceutical companies are required to conduct interventional studies that meet the approval standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are frequently utilized to fulfill these requirements. This type of study is considered the gold standard and involves randomly assigning one group of patients to receive a specific drug while the other group does not receive it, then comparing the outcomes.

Legally and medically, ivermectin can be prescribed off-label to treat COVID-19 since it has already been approved by the FDA for other diseases.

Although many doctors have observed the positive effects of ivermectin in treating their patients, the media has specifically highlighted data from a few selected RCTs that have concluded it is ineffective in treating COVID-19.

However, some critical aspects were overlooked in those RCTs.

A drug’s therapeutic effects can only be observed when it reaches the appropriate concentration in the body and remains there for a few days, allowing sufficient time to work.

Improper dosing was a major issue in the RCTs that found ivermectin ineffective.

According to Merck’spackage insertfor ivermectin (brand name Stromectol), a single oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg was officially recommended for treating parasitic diseases. There is no official dose for COVID-19.

The recommended dosage of ivermectin for treating COVID-19 is based on the clinical experiences of physicians worldwide.

The Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC) guidelinesrecommendtaking 0.4 mg/kg of ivermectin daily, immediately after exposure. Once a cumulative dose in excess of 200 mg is reached, the risk of acquiring COVID-19 has been shown to be nearly zero.

It is common for a drug with multiple indications to have different doses for different diseases.

Moreover, ivermectin should be given with food, as it has a2.6-fold higher bioavailabilitywhen taken with food rather than on an empty stomach. The Merck package insert (revised May 2022) also supports this and states: “Administration of 30 mg ivermectin following a high-fat meal resulted in an approximate 2.5-fold increase in bioavailability relative to administration of 30 mg ivermectin in the fasted state.”

FLCCC guidelinesalso recommend taking ivermectin “with or just following a meal for greater absorption.”

Yet this important dosing information is not reflected in the commonly used drug prescribing resource known as the Prescribers’ Digital Reference orPDRwhich states: “Take the number of tablets your doctor has prescribed all at the same time with water on an empty stomach. Do not eat any food within two hours before or after taking the tablets.”

So if a person takes the dose while fasting, they are getting only40 percentof the recommended dose. For patients with a higher body weight, the effects of underdosing could be even more significant.

In the most recentPRINCIPLEtrial published in March, ivermectin was used at 0.3 mg/kg for only three days. Moreover, it was designed to dose the ivermectin without food: “Participants were advised not to eat two hours before or after taking ivermectin.”

In another RCTACTIV-6published in JAMA in October 2022, ivermectin was dosed in a fasting status, as theprotocolstated: “Ivermectin should be taken on an empty stomach with water (30 minutes before a meal or 2 hours after a meal).”

Ivermectin was reported as dosed at 0.4 mg/kg for three days—a much shorter time period than it should be.However, in the protocol Table 4 in Appendix 16.3.3, the precise dosing was as low as 0.269 mg/kg, and 0.4 mg/kg is actually only the upper dose limit—not the real dose.

According to the worldwide recognized study guidelineICH Good Clinical Practice, clinical trials must adhere to ethical principles. Failure to do so would be considered studymisconduct or fraudand would violate the principle of integrity.

Another JAMA study published in March 2021 repeated the same mistake in mild COVID-19 patients by suggesting they take 0.3 mg/kg for five days on anempty stomach.

An RCT study known asTOGETHER, published in March 2022 in the New England Journal of Medicine, underdosed ivermectin with 0.4 mg/kg for only three days and did not mention dosing with food.

Nevertheless,even at this low dose, the ivermectin still reduced hospitalization rates, death, and the need for mechanical ventilation compared to a placebo.

It is inappropriate to conclude that ivermectin was ineffective based on these RCT studies with major design flaws.

Despite the poor study design, ivermectin showed clinical benefits and saved lives.

In the PRINCIPLE study, self-reported recovery was shorter in the ivermectin group than usual care, with a median decrease of 2.06 days. The statistical analysis showed that it met the predefined superiority criteria.

Furthermore, the analysis showed that ivermectin effectively reduced COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths. Only 1.6 percent of 2,157 patients in the ivermectin group experienced hospitalizations or deaths, compared to 4.4 percent of 3,256 patients in the usual care group.

Even a low dose of ivermectin has demonstrated the potential to save lives. However, the authors concluded, “Ivermectin for COVID-19 is unlikely to provide clinically meaningful improvement in recovery, hospital admissions, or longer-term outcomes.”

Meanwhile, the report’s appendix includes dozens of recorded clinical benefits in patients treated with ivermectin, such as the time it took toalleviateall symptoms, general unwellness, muscle aches, and headaches. The improvement of symptoms was alsosustained, and theseverity was reduced. Surprisingly, the source PDF wasremovedfrom the website during the writing of this article.

There are additional examples. Although the previously mentioned 2021 JAMA study underdosed patients, treatment with ivermectin reduced recovery time by two days. In the ACTIV-6 study, only one venous blood clot event was reported in 817 ivermectin-treated patients, compared to five events in 774 placebo-treated patients.

It is important to note that the definition of treatment effects in an RCT can differ from those discussed in real-life observational studies.

Sometimes, even if the results of a clinical trial demonstrate a clear effect, the conclusion may still be interpreted as ineffective due to the statistical definition of effectiveness.

Interpreting statistics can be challenging as they usually involve complicated mathematical models and numerical data that can be manipulated to support a specific agenda. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this discussion, let’s presume that all research is carried out conscientiously and without manipulative intent.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with mild to moderate COVID-19 patients, none of the 55 patients in the ivermectin group died, whereas four of 57 in the placebo group died. This resulted in a comparison ofzero percent versus 7 percent. Moreover, only 1.8 percent of ivermectin-treated patients needed invasive ventilation compared to 8.8 percent in the placebo group.

In other words, ivermectin reduced the risk of death by 100 percent and the need for ventilators by 80 percent.

However, the article did not provide the p-value (probability value) for the death rate comparison or the invasive ventilation of 0.102 (Table 2), which is higher than the 0.05 threshold considered to be a significant statistical difference.

P-values are commonly used to test and measure a “null hypothesis,” which states that no differences exist in the effects being studied between two groups. A finding is considered statistically significant and warrants publication when the p-value is 0.05 or less.

The p-values in this study were deemed insignificant because they were more than 0.05. Accordingly, the authors wrote that this difference was statistically insignificant and concluded that ivermectin “had shown only marginal benefit.”

How could a 100 percent reduction in death or an 80 percent reduction in ventilation be interpreted as “marginal” effects?

In theI-TECH studypublished in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2022, the patients treated with ivermectin had a lower mortality rate of 1.2 percent compared to 4 percent in the comparator group."

As the U.S. benchmark oil price,West Texas Intermediate, hit $85 per barrel—the highest level in nearly six months, Texas producers keep pumping crude,but their wells also produce gas, which basically has nowhere to go.

While producers are chasing higher realizations for the crude they pump, they are depressing further an already depressed U.S. natural gas market, which has been oversupplied for months due to a milder winter and lower demand for heating and electricity.

Producers in West Texas are hit by the negative price of natural gas at the Waha hub,which means that they have to pay for someone to take that gas. But demand just isn’t there.

“They’re bringing these drilled, uncompleted wells online because the price of oil is higher,” Dennis Kissler, senior vice president for trading at BOK Financial Securities, toldBloomberg.

“It’s flooding the market with gas, and you’ve got no demand,” Kissler added.

Yet, signs have started to emerge thatthe natural gas glut may have startedto hold back drillingin parts of the Permian basin.

U.S. oil producers are not in a rush to significantly boost crude production despite oil prices hovering at a six-month high, as multi-year low natural gas prices and higher costs are weighing on the industry, analysts and executives toldReutersearlier this month.

Oil producers in America are also mindful of the investor demands for higher returns, not necessarily higher production.

“Natural gas is currently pricing at or below costs of production,”an executive at an exploration and production company said incommentsin the latest quarterly Dallas Fed Energy Survey released at the end of March.

2024-04-11 21:56:03,"GODL! Precious Metal Soars Above $2,400 After Sudden Gap Higher",https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/godl-precious-metal-soars-above-2400-after-sudden-gap-higher#comment-stream,"Crypto bulls - at least those who didn't betray their ""laser eyes"" PFP and sell previously - have had their day in the sun for the past 3 months as bitcoin and most other digital fiat alternatives soared, making it clear why, despite the difficult, it can be so very profitable toHODL, especially with the US is approaching the Minsky Moment of issuing $1 trillion in debt every 100 days, and interest on US debt, now at $1.1 trillion, is set to surpass Social Security spending andbecome the single largest government outlay before the end of the year.

Now that rate cuts are off the table, interest on US debt - currently the second biggest government outlay at $1.1 trillion - will surpass social security and become the single biggest US expense before the end of 2024 at $1.6 trillion.pic.twitter.com/OQYjHhOks9

And now, it's time forGODL!

Stupid jokes aside, while bitcoin was rampaging higher, goldbugs stared in disgust, wondering why their non-fiat god had forsaken them... after all, when the collapse of the dollar, and fiat in general, finally arrives gold will be one of the very few currency alternatives still standing. Alas, ETF flows have not provided any respite, because while bitcoin ETFs soaked up most money in the past 3 months, aggregate gold flows continued to shrink.

And yet, starting in the beginning of March, gold finally broke out from the black hole gravitational attraction of theBank of International Settlementstrading desk, and has soared some $300 dollars in just 6 weeks, its fastest ascent in decades.

Fast forward to tonight when, with most other assets quiet, gold suddenly surged higher, and after closing at an all time high, the precious metals spiked by another $15 in a matter of seconds, a move which for the otherwise hyperlethargic assets, is the equivalent of turbo boost.

And while it's now just a matter of hours if not minutes, before spot rises above $2,400, gold futures are already there: the active, June contract just hit a new all time high of $2,406.9 moments ago around the time Chinese buy orders started rolling in...

... and contrary to speculation that this is just a fat finger, or a another one-off buy orders, gold future volumes are solid, especially given volumes would have already been very high in the last few days. GCM4 volumes are now 23.5k lots vs. 5-day average of 17.85k lots.

While it wasn't clear what sparked the buying frenzy, UBS' trading desk notes that ""gold futures gapped up $10 as they traded through Thursday's high on what felt like stop losses being triggered;0.5moz of futures volume were behind the move.""

What happens next is also unclear, although as we showed moments before the breakout, the current divergence between gold prices and 10Y real rates, suggests that something awful is about to happen...

this is not normalpic.twitter.com/mv0uLsDs7R

... a dismal outlookproposed last weekby none other than BofA CIO Michael Hartnett, who in his latest Flow Show report noted that investors are looking beyond the ""here and now"", realizing that there is no way markets or the economy can sustain 5% nominal and 2% real rates, and are hedging two things:i) the risk that the Fed cuts as CPI accelerates, and ii) and more ominously, the ""endgame of Fed Interest Cost Control (""ICC""), Yield Curve Control (YCC) and QE to backstop US government spending.""

In short, something big is about to break, and if the surge in gold leads to a spike in yields, start the countdown to one of two things: i) QE and/or ii) YCC, because if the bond market sniffs out the endgame that gold is currently smelling, it will be up to Powell to once again prevent a catastrophic financial collapse.

For those wondering how far gold can rise, we excerpt from the latest note from BofA commodities strategist Michael Widmer (available to professional subscribers), who writes that...

Gold and silver are among our most preferred commodities, withthe yellow metal pushed up by central banks, China investors and, increasingly, Western buyers on a confluence of macro factors, including an end to hiking cycles.Accordingly,we see the yellow metal rally to US$3,000/oz by 2025.Silver benefits from that too, with prices also boosted by stronger industrial demand. This could take prices above US$30/oz within the next 12 months.

And here is UBS, predicting that the price of the precious metal could double from here (notealso available to pro subs):

The recent move in gold reminds me of a famous quote: “There are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen.” Looking at history,gold price can stay in the doldrums for a long time but when it does breakout, the surge is usually fast and furious.In deciding whether to chase or fade the recent gold rally, it might be useful to draw some inspiration from past breakout episodes.Here I define a ""breakout"" to be when the gold prices move 10% above the previous historical peak.

Should history repeat itself, it is not too late to participate in the current gold rally.An investor with a two to three-year view could expect to see gold potentially double from here to more than $4,000. The take-profit signal is when real rates turn negative and when there is a full-blown recession.Today with real rate still high and a recession seemingly faraway, it is too early to call the end of the ongoing gold rally.Gold breakout can be seen as an ominous signal, and it is not difficult to imagine a range of geopolitical risk scenarios. As for markets,many things look mispriced today with a two to three-year lookout, ranging from incredibly low credit spreads, elevated equity valuation to subdued volatility. It's fair to say that the gold market has fired its warning shot.

2024-04-11 22:30:00,"In Latest Humiliation For Biden Admin, Russian Oil Is Trading Above The G7 Price Cap Everywhere",https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/latest-humiliation-biden-admin-russian-oil-trading-above-g7-price-cap-everywhere#comment-stream,"Back in late 2022, when ""Western democracies"" bombastically unveiled theatrical sanctions against Putin, capping the price at which imports of Russian oil were permitted to no higher than $60, we said that this was one of the biggest farces in modern history, not only because it was an optical play that was made entirely for public consumption (as nobody in the west actually wanted to curtail Russian oil exports as the outcome would be a devastating surge of inflation asBiden now realizes), but also because there was no enforcement mechanism to cap the price at $60 and no more.

We were right, again, and todayBloomberg reportsthat ""Russian oil is trading far in excess of a Group of Seven price cap that’s supposed to deprive Moscow of revenue for its war in Ukraine, suggesting significant non-compliance with the measure"", which anyone with half a working brain would have expected to happen, which of course excludes virtually all ""democratic"" bureaucrats who implemented this idiotic sanction (which only ended up makingthe Vitol oil traders billionaires).

According to data from Argus Media, whose price assessments are followed by some G-7 nations involved in the cap, Russian flagship Urals grade oil is now selling for $75 a barrel at the point it leaves ports in the Baltic Sea and Black Sea. A Treasury official told Bloomberg that US officials are tracking the price increase, which they attribute to broader geopolitical dynamics, as the alternative -admitting they are idiots,would be a bit too introspective.

As a reminder, the Russian embaro cap requires that any western company involved in transporting Russian oil receives a so-called attestation, a document vouching that the cargo cost $60-a barrel or less. If it doesn’t, they’re not allowed to provide their services. The fact that Argus’s prices are so far above that level creates what Bloomberg called a ""dissonance"",but what we would call, a giant slap on the face of the Biden administration which nobody takes seriously any more.

While Urals has been above $60 almost all year, this month’s surge to well above $70 will stretch the credibility of those attestations for traders wanting to keep using western services. Not like anyone actually thought those attestations had any credibility to begin with since the governments enforcing them were so clearly interested in having everyoneignorethem.

Bloomberg data showed that in March, 23% of the nation’s crude oil shipments had insurance against spills and collisions provided by members of the International Group of P&I Clubs. That means traders would havevouched that the cargoes cost well below where Argus assessed the Urals price to be, which was clearly not the case, and means that at least a quarter of Russian oil shippers are fabricating data.A smaller proportion moved on Greek tankers, all of which had cover from IG clubs, also requiring attestation.

Hilariously, the idiots in the Biden admin told Bloomberg that the cap is still having its intended effect, reducing the amount of money the Kremlin receives from oil sales by forcing the commodity to either be sold under the cap via western services, or through Russia’s shadow fleet. Which, of course, is absolutely not the case and Putin is currently rolling in the cash from selling oil to the same European nations that are supplying Ukraine with their most modern weapons which Putin then handily blows up and reverse engineers. The US plans to continue the enforcement of the cap by sanctioning vessels operating in the shadow fleet, but will not do so in response to any specific market moves, the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, and for the reason that it would be extremely embarrassing if his name were to become public.

A European Commission spokesperson said the bloc is aware of the risk of the price cap being dodged, and is committed to steps that deprive Russia of revenue while simultaneously “supporting global energy market stability.” It’s also constantly reviewing existing measures to enforce the cap and prevent its violation or circumvention, the spokesperson said, adding that such measures require unanimity among member states. In other words, Europe knew from day one that the Russian oil embargo was not going to work, and now, a year and a half later, is blame the lack of ""unity"" for this farce.

The bloc’s most recent sanctions package was aimed at tighten the cap’s enforcement, the spokesperson said; clearly the package did not achieve the ""desired outcome.""

Of course, it's not just Russia that is rolling in dough: by the time Urals cargoes get to India, the grade is trading at $88 a barrel — just $3.80 below than the global benchmark for physical cargoes, Dated Brent, Argus data show. When the nation’s ESPO crude leaves the port of Kozmino in eastern Russia, it is at $84 a barrel. It hasn’t been close to the price cap for about a year.

Bloomberg concludes that since last October, ""the US Treasury has shown it’s prepared to punish companies for breaches of the price cap that happened in the past"" however,given its desire to avoid any actions that disrupt the flow of crude — and risk higher prices — the rally in headline Brent futures to around $90 a barrel may temper any push to do so at this time.

In other words... well, this:

2024-04-11 22:55:00,Biden Admin Finalizes Controversial Rule To Expand Background Checks On Gun Sales,https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/biden-admin-finalizes-controversial-rule-expand-background-checks-gun-sales,"Authored by Michael Clements via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) has submitted the final version of a controversialruleto change the definition of what it means to be “Engaged in the Business” of dealing in firearms.

The U.S. Attorney General says the change, required by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act enacted June 25, 2022, will save lives by requiring anyone who “devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business or predominately earns a profit through the repetitive purchase and sale of firearms” to obtain a Federal Firearms License.

“Under this regulation, it will not matter if guns are sold on the internet at a gun show or at a brick-and-mortar store:if you sell guns predominately to earn a profit, you must be licensed, and you must conduct background checks,” Attorney General Merrick Garland wrote in a statement on the ATF website.

Critics of the change say the rule will effectively end private transactions, possibly including the inheritance of firearms within families.

According to the ATF statement, President Joe Biden issued Executive Order 14092 on March 14, 2023, which directed Mr. Garland to clarify the definition of who is engaged in the business of dealing in firearms. The plan immediately drew criticism from gun rights activists.

“The ATF is using the [Bipartisan Safer Communities Act] BSCA to substantially revise all regulations governing who and what constitutes a ‘dealer’ and how such dealers may conduct business. This proposal advances a radical left-wing agenda that will undermine the Second Amendment and the Constitutional rights of all Americans,” Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.) wrote in a Dec. 7, 2023, letter to ATF Director Steen Dettelbach.

Mr. Garland signed the new rule on April 10, and it will become effective May 10, 2024.

According to the466-page rule, the only requirement for determining whether a person is engaged in the business of selling guns is whether the person is trading to “predominately earn a profit” rather than to earn a “livelihood.”

Critics claim that under the new rule, the transfer of a single gun between private citizens would require the seller to have an FFL and to perform a check through the National Criminal Instant Background Check System (NICS). This would effectively end all private firearm sales and could even subject parents to federal prosecution for trying to pass family heirlooms along to their children.

“Once again, the Biden Administration is weaponizing every tool in their tool box to intimidate, harass, and criminalize gun owners with unlawful executive actions. This Backdoor Universal Registration Check rule is nothing more than a move to criminalize the sale of a single gun without a background check,” Aidan Johnston, Director of Federal Affairs for Gun Owners of America wrote in a statement to The Epoch Times.

But the new rule states that is not the case.

“Individuals may continue to engage in intrastate private sales without a license, provided that such individuals are not ‘engaged in the business’ and the transactions are otherwise compliant with law,” the rule reads.

In an ATF press release, Mr. Dettlebach stated that the rule is about closing an avenue by which criminals obtain guns.

“Today’s final rule is about ensuring compliance with an important area of the existing law where we all know, the data show, and we can clearly see that a whole group of folks are openly flouting the law,” Mr. Dettlebach is quoted as saying. “That leads to not just unfair, but in this case dangerous consequences.”

But Second Amendment advocates say the new rule is the next step in the Biden Administration’s plan to implement gun control measures through administrative action that it can’t get through the legislative process.

“The government hopes to ensure that they are fully involved in every firearm transfer, and eventually the records of all those transfers will end up in their records database. Just last month ATF executed an airport executive in Arkansas during a pre-dawn raid because he was ‘engaged in the business’ without one of ATF’s licenses. This could quickly become the new normal, so liberty-loving Americans are right to be concerned,” Mr. Johnston’s statement reads.

2024-04-11 23:20:00,Nearly 20% Of Recent San Francisco Home Sales Were Underwater,https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/nearly-20-recent-san-francisco-home-sales-were-underwater#comment-stream,"Nearly 20% of homes sold in San Francisco during the three months ending Feb. 29sold at a loss. What's more, the typical SF homeowner took $155,500 less than they bought it for, which is400% morein dollar terms than the nationwide median loss of $39,912 over the same period,Redfinreports, citing aninternal analysisof county records and MLS data across the US.

San Francisco home sellers are far more likely than sellers in the rest of the country to lose money becausehome prices there have dropped dramatically since the pandemic homebuying boom. Still, the Bay Area is home to the most expensive real estate market in the U.S.

San Francisco’s median sale price peaked at $1.66 million in April 2022, and has since fallen 15% ($250,000) to $1.41 million as of February. The typical person who bought in San Francisco at nearly any point in 2021 or 2022, when the housing market was red hot due to ultra-low mortgage rates, would have taken a loss if they sold during the first few months of this year. -Redfin

""Home prices have fallen from their peak, especially when it comes to condos,"" said real estate agent Christine Chang. ""It’s not just because mortgage rates are high.San Francisco has lost some of its appeal post-pandemic. A lot of tech employers and big-name retailers have moved out of the city,and some of my clients have reported they’re leaving the area becausethey don’t feel as safe as they used to.""

According to the same report,Detroit came in secondin terms of homes selling at a loss (10.8%) during the three months ending February 29, followed by three other Rust Belt and Midwestern metros: Cleveland (8.2%), St. Louis (8.1%) and Chicago (7.9%).

Sellers in those places are more likely than most to lose moneybecause, like in San Francisco, home prices have fallen quite a bit from their pandemic peak. In Detroit, for instance,the median sale price is down roughly 20% from its pandemic peak.

Additionally, housing markets in Detroit and Chicago have suffered because they’re typically among the U.S. metros homebuyers are most likely to leave. -Redfin

Least likely to take a loss?

Homeowners inNew England andSouthernCaliforniawere least likely to sell at a loss - with just1.2% of homeownerswho sold during the same period losing money.

This is followed by Boston, Anaheim, CA, Fort Lauderdale, FL, and San Diego, where roughly2% of homessold for less than the seller originally paid in each of those metros.

That said,the vast majority of sellers are still profitable on their home sales- even in San Francisco, where 82% of sellers took in more than they paid - with the typical seller banking $482,000 more than their cost basis over the period analyzed.Nationwide, 96% of sellers are postive on their sales, with a median gain of $196,016 thanks to thenational media home price sitting just 5% below the all-time highset in mid-2022.

2024-04-11 23:45:00,Ukraine's Drone Strikes Against Russian Oil Refineries Complicate Biden's Re-Election Bid,https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/ukraines-drone-strikes-against-russian-oil-refineries-complicate-bidens-re-election#comment-stream,"Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

CNN published a detailed piece on Tuesday about how“Ukraine’s AI-enabled drones are trying to disrupt Russia’s energy industry. So far, it’s working”.Although an unnamed source close to the program told them that “The flights are determined in advance with our allies, and the aircraft follow the flight plan to enable us to strike targets with meters of precision”, there are reasons to believe that the US is against these sorts of attacks. Not least among them is what CNN itself reported in that same piece.

According to them, “Ukrainian strikes on refineries have caused global oil prices to rise, with Brent crude up nearly 13% this year, leaving politicians in the United States worried about their potential economic impact in an important election year.” They also cited an expert who claimed,“That was the deal with Ukraine: We will give you money, we will give you weapons, but stay away from the export facility﻿, stay away from Russian energy, because we don’t want a massive energy crisis.”

That individual added in reference to theCongressional deadlock on Ukraine aidthat“If they’re not getting the weapons and money that they were promised, what is their incentive to abide by that deal with Washington?”This aligns with what Zelensky himself hinted in an interview with theWashington Postlate last month when he revealed that“The reaction of the US was not positive on [us attacking Russian oil refineries]…(but) We used our drones. Nobody can say to us you can’t.”

Secretary of State Blinkenechoed that sentimentin a joint press conference with his French counterpart on Tuesday when he said in response to a question about these oil refinery strikes that“we have neither supported nor enabled strikes by Ukraine outside of its territory.”He was asked about this after a Ukrainian drone striketargeted Russia’s third-largest refineryin the Republic of Tatarstan, which is located in the country’s heartland a full 800 miles away from the front lines.

When reflecting on Blinken’s statement, CNN’s report, and Zelensky’s earlier words,it certainly appears to be the case that the US doesn’t want Ukraine striking Russian oil refineries out of fear that the massive energy crisis that this could catalyze would capsize Biden’s re-election bid.

If that’s indeed its position, then it raises the question of which allies are determining the flight paths of these drones andwhy Zelensky would risk Trump returning to power when he’s much less pro-Ukrainian than Biden is.

It might very well be the case that there are divisions emerging within NATO over these strikes exactly asRTeditorialized when drawing attention to how Blinken’s French counterpart seemed to support the latest attacks in his response to the question that they were asked during Tuesday’s press conference. France might therefore be providing this sort of assistance, which could also be complemented by the UK’s and other countries’ complementary contributions, whether on their own or as part of a joint effort.

As for why Zelensky would want to rankle Biden and risk Trump’s return, he might have a “god complex” after being promoted so heavily as a Churchillian leader over the past two years, which could have become part of his identity despite the media souring on him since last summer. In his mind, Biden will do his bidding in somehow getting the Republicans to approve more Ukraine aid under pain of him unleashing a massive energy crisis by taking out more of Russia’s refining and export capabilities.

Biden would have already gotten the Republicans to do this if he was able to so it’s delusional for Zelensky to imagine that holding his re-election bid hostage will make a positive difference. If anything, wider awareness his thuggish tactics among the Republicans could further solidify their resistance to approving more Ukraine aid since Zelensky isn’t just holding Biden’s re-election bid hostage, but the entire American economy as well and therefore also threatening the US’ objective national interests.

Should he authorize a series of strikes that catalyzes the massive energy crisis that the Biden Administration fears, then the most hawkish anti-Russian deep state faction that’s responsible for artificially perpetuating this conflict might lose the influence that it exerts over policymakers. Their comparatively less hawkish rivals could replace their dominant role in that scenario and possibly convince the Biden Administration to finallyagree to a pragmatic compromisefor ending the conflict.

Zelensky’s decision to hold Biden’s re-election bid hostage by threatening to unleash a massive economic crisis as revenge for the Congressional deadlock on Ukraine aid might be his downfall. He’s not only biting the hand that feeds his regime on the taxpayers’ dime but also threatening the US’ objective national interests.

The desperation that his forces feel on the battlefield isdriving himto “go rogue”, but his patrons might soon tire of this anddecide to replace himafter his term expires on 21 May.

2024-04-12 02:00:00,How Turkish Sanctions Against Israel Will Impact Bilateral Trade,https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/how-turkish-sanctions-against-israel-will-impact-bilateral-trade#comment-stream,"Turkey’s decision tohalt the export of 54 products to Israelin response to its war on Gaza isn’t likely to have far-reaching results, since both countries' economies are complementary in nature rather than central to each other.

The Turkish trade ministry announced earlier this week that Ankara would continue to implement the restrictions as long as Israel denies uninterrupted flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza Strip, citing UN Security Council decisions and an International Court of Justice (ICJ) preliminary judgment against Israel’s conduct in the coastal enclave. The export restrictions encompass items such asaluminium wire, steel, cement, construction materials, granite, chemicals, pesticides, engine oils, jet fuel and bricks.

Before the war, Turkish-Israeli ties had been steadier than they had been for years. After years of tensions over Palestine, the two normalized relations in 2022. Yet, while Turkey and Israel quarreled over the past decade, and even stopped cooperating with each other, trade had never been interrupted. In fact, it flourished over time.

The Turkish public has been outraged at Israel’s actions in Gaza, where reportedly more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in six months. Lists of ships carrying goods to Israel circulated on social media as Israel's onslaught grew. People also highlighted companies close to the Turkish government that continued commercial relations with Israel during the war.

Even though there is no evidence to back claims that Turkey sold weapons to Israel, the controversy was stoked by a small quantity of hunting gear or hunting equipment parts being found among the exports.They were broadly classified by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK) as “weaponry”.

In response to this domestic pressure andserious setbacks for the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in local elections last month, the government decided to act against Israel.

Ties have been cut on the Israeli side, too. In October, several Israeli supermarket chains halted imports from Turkey in response to Ankara’s critical stance on the Gaza war. Israeli food company Strauss in December changed the packaging for one of its most well-known products, Elite Turkish coffee, adding an Israeli flag and patriotic slogans.

But is the trade between the two countries vital? Many say no, but Israel is nonetheless an important export market for Ankara.Turkey’s exports to Israel were worth $5.4bn in 2023, or 2.1 percent of its total exports, according to official data.

Although bilateral trade has dropped by 33 percent since the October 7 Hamas-led attack, it has nonetheless continued and exports to Israel have increased each month in 2024 so far. Both countries have had a free trade deal in place since 1996 and there have been no tariffs on certain products since 2000, which has enabled major increases in bilateral trade, largely favouring Turkey.

From 2009 to 2023, trade between the two countries nearlytripled. By the end of that period, Turkey had become the fifth-largest supplier of imported goods to Israel, while Israel ranked as Turkey's tenth-largest export market, based on data from theCentral Bureau of Statistics.

Turkey exported steel, automotive industry products, chemicals, ready-made clothing and apparel, electricity and electronics, cement, glass, ceramics and soil products, furniture, paper, and forestry to Israel, according to a report published by the Turkey Exporters Assembly covering the period between 2011 and 2020.

“The economies are complementary but not intertwined,” Gallia Lindenstrauss, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), told Middle East Eye. “Turkey can find also substitutes to what it imports from Israel, and anyhow, of the bilateral trade, three-quarters are Turkish exports to Israel and only one-quarter is Israeli exports to Turkey.”

Trade with Israel has traditionally been highly advantageous for Turkey, which enjoyed a trade surplus of $3.9bn last year. Israel serves as a significant market for Turkish steel, purchasing 726,000 tonnes last year. This figure constitutesover 20 percentof Turkey's total steel exports. The ban is expected to significantly affect these exports.

In terms of dependence on imports,Israel heavily relies on Turkish cement, with imports from Turkey making up29 percent of Israel's total cement importslast year. Additionally, Turkish imports represent about 11 percent of Israel's total plastic and rubber products, and around 10 percent in textiles.

Sources familiar with the construction industrytoldIsraeli news outlet Mako that the new restrictions wereexpected to increasethe prices of apartments and rent in the country if they are implemented. “In terms of long-term repercussions, the fact the Turkey halts construction materials when these are needed to repair damaged houses in the south and north of Israel because of rockets and other damage will likely taint relations also in the future,” Lindenstrauss said.

“Also, while anyhow there were question marks regarding a possible gas pipeline between Israel and Turkey, these export restrictions in a time of war will be a big warning sign not to proceed with the pipeline idea.”

Turkey’s decision to restrict exports to Israel likely has an impact on Palestine as well. “Israel has complete control over the border crossings as Palestinian imports arrive at Haifa or Ashdod seaports, andthe goods are then transported to Palestinian territories via trucks,"" Rashad Yousef, director of policies and planning at the Palestinian Ministry of National Economy,toldAnadolu Agency.

Yousef added that Palestinian-Turkish trade volume in 2022 exceeded $900m, representing a 12 percent increase over 2021. He also said that the main Turkish exports to Palestine are iron, wood, vegetable oil, tobacco, food products and items from the plastic industries.

""If we exclude Israel, Turkiye is the largest source of goods and products in the Palestinian market,""Yousef said. However, there are ways to continue to trade with Israel by rerouting trade through third countries, as the Ukraine war has proved following western sanctions on Russia.

Israeli importers are mulling bringing in Turkish goods via Slovenian ports Koper or Ljubljana, according to an Israeli report. “But still, the economic relations were what kept the relations going even in times of political crisis, so it is regrettable we have reached this point,” adds Lindenstrauss.

“And despite it having been a painful step, I don't see it in itself changing Israel's policy - the pressures from the White House are much more significant.”

Statista's Katharina Buchholz reportsthata poll conducted by the Institute of Southeast Asian Studiesfound that 50.5 percent of respondents in the ten ASEAN member countries would choose the Asian power in 2024, while 49.5 percent would pick the United States.

This has changed from 38.9 percent and 61.1 percent, respectively, just one year ago.

You will find more infographics atStatista

The change is largely due to respondents from Laos, Indonesia and Malaysia favoring China more strongly at an increase of between 20 to 30 percentage points each since 2023.

In Cambodia, support increased by around 18 percentage points, but remained below 50 percent overall.

The picture in similar in Thailand and Myanmar at increases of around 10 percentage points each and with support for China in Thailand reaching 52 percent.

Countries that would still strongly prefer to partner with theUnited Statesare the Philippines (83.3 percent in favor of the U.S.), Vietnam (79 percent) and Singapore (61.5 percent).

In all three countries, support for the U.S. was relatively stable compared to 2023.

2024-04-12 03:30:00,'Automated Assassination': Israel Lets AI Decide Who Dies In Gaza,https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/israel-lets-ai-decide-who-dies-gaza-report#comment-stream,"Authored by Will Porter via The Libertarian Institute,

The Israeli military has employed yet another AI-based system to select bombing targets in the Gaza Strip, an investigation by+972 Magazinehas revealed. The new system has generatedsweeping kill listscondemning tens of thousands of Palestinians, part of the IDF’s growing dependence on AI to plan lethal strikes.

Citing six Israeli intelligence officers, the Tel Aviv-based magazine said the previouslyundisclosed AI system, dubbed ‘Lavender,’ has played a “central role in the unprecedented bombing” of Gaza since last October, with the militaryeffectively treating its output “as if it were a human decision.”

“Formally, the Lavender system is designed to mark all suspected operatives in the military wings of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ),including low-ranking ones, as potential bombing targets,” the outlet reported, adding that “during the first weeks of the war, the army almost completely relied on Lavender, which clocked as many as 37,000 Palestinians as suspected militants—and their homes—for possible air strikes.”

However, while thousands have been killed in the resulting air raids, the majority were “women and children or people who were not involved in the fighting,” the officers told the magazine, noting that Israeli field commandersoften rely on the AI system without consulting more substantial intelligence.

“Human personnel often served only as a‘rubber stamp’ for the machine’s decisions,” one source said, adding that many commanders spend a mere “20 seconds” reviewing targets before approving strikes—“just to make sure the Lavender-marked target is male.”

Human input has been relegated to such a minor role in the decision-making process that Lavender’s conclusions are often treated as “an order” by Israeli troops, “with no requirement to independently check why the machine made that choice.”

Such decisions are made despite well-known system errors which result inmisidentified targets in at least 10% of cases. Nonetheless, the AI has “systematically” selected the homes of suspected militants for strikes, with IDF bombings frequently carried out late at night, when entire families are more likely to be present.

In targeting lower-level Hamas fighters in the early stages of the war, the military largely resorted to theuse of unguided ‘dumb bombs,’concluding it was permissible to“kill up to 15 or 20 civilians” in such operations, the intelligence sources added. Senior militants, meanwhile, could warrant the deaths of “more than 100 civilians” in some cases.

“You don’t want to waste expensive bombs on unimportant people,”one officer said.

Lavender is far from the first AI program used to direct operations for Israel’s military. Yet another system unveiled by +972 mag, known as‘Where’s Daddy?’, has also been used “specifically to track the targeted individuals and carry out bombings when they had entered their family’s residences.”

An unnamed intelligence officer told the outlet that homes are considered a “first option” for targeting, observing that the IDF is “not interested in killing [Hamas] operatives only when they [are] in a military building or engaged in a military activity.”

As of April, Israeli bombings have damaged or destroyeda staggering 62% of all housing units in Gaza—or nearly 300,000 homes—leaving more than 1 million people internally displaced, according toUnited Nations estimates. The territory’s housing sector has borne the brunt of the Israeli onslaught, representing well over two-thirds of the destruction in Gaza to date.

Earlier reporting has shed further light on Israel’s AI-driven “mass assassination factory,” with another program, ‘the Gospel,’ used to automatically generate massive target lists at a rate vastly exceeding previous methods. Under the guidance of that tool, Israeli forces have increasingly struck what they call “power targets,” including high-rise residential structures and public buildings. Such attacks are reportedly part of an effort to exert “civil pressure” on Palestinian society—a tactic clearly prohibited under international law as a form ofcollective punishment.

The IDF has long relied on extensive “target banks” in planning operations in Gaza and the West Bank, gathering a long list of suspected militant command posts and installations. In recent years, however, those lists have swelled to include thousands of potential targets as the militaryoutsources decision-makingtoautomated systems.

Adding to the litany of AI programs used to deliver death in Gaza and beyond, Israel’s ‘Fire Factory’ system helps to automatically calculate munitions payloads and assign targets to particular aircraft or drones once they are selected. “What used to take hours now takes minutes, with a few more minutes for human review,” an IDF colonel said of the system in comments to Bloomberg.

Artificial intelligence and AI-powered facial recognition tech have similarly taken a greater role inpolicing the borderbetween the occupied territories and Israel proper—as well asWest Bank checkpoints—with the IDF deploying alitany of new systemstoidentify, surveil and arrestPalestinians in recent years.

2024-04-12 04:15:00,German Defense Chief Compares Putin To Hitler,https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/german-defense-chief-says-putin-has-expansionist-aims-just-hitler-churchill-event#comment-stream,"Amid the recent days of stepped-upmajor Russian attacks on Ukraine's energyinfrastructure, which the Kremlin on Thursday said is necessary in response to Ukrainian forces' own cross-border attacks on Russian oil refineries, the rhetoric out of Europe is becoming unhinged.

In but the latest example of this, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has compared Putin and his war in Ukraine to Nazi leaderAdolf Hitler’s annexation of Czechoslovak territory in 1938.

Pistorius echoed the assumption that Putin is waging an expansionist war and seeks to take more territory even beyond Ukraine, which remains unfounded and with zero evidence. Still, the defense chief urged Europe toprepare for large-scale Russian attack.

""Putin will not stop once the war against Ukraine is over,""Pistorius said late Wednesday. Somewhat ironically, the provocative comments were issued at an event unveiling a new biography of Britain’s wartime leader Winston Churchill.

""He has also said that clearly,"" Pistorius continued.""Just as clearly as Hitler, who also always said that he would not stop.""

""We have to put this country back in a position where it can defend itself,"" Pistorius said at the book event, as cited inBloomberg. ""We have to decide now whether we want to prepare for a genuine threat from Putin to materialize or whether we want to make it easy for him.""

In February, Pistorius announced that Germany might seek to increase defense spending by as much 3.5% of economic output, though he also conceded that finding the funds would be tough.

NATO officials and connected think tanks have long assumed that Putinseeks to erecta new Russian 'empire' - given that in a number of speeches he's made positive references to Czar Peter the Great while speaking of""returning historically Russian lands.""

But so far at least, there have been noactionsof the Russian military directly threatening other states outside Ukraine. Recently Moldova has been a big concern of Western planners, with some reports claiming that the Kremlin isseeking to destabilizethe small former Soviet republic which neighbors Ukraine and Romania.

Not so original:the whole 'Putler' trend and Hitler comparison has been a worn-out talking point of Western officials and media headlines going back years...

Putin is an illegitimate President who is afraid of real elections because he is afraid of his people.To defeat him, bring victory to Ukraine, and freedom to the Russian people we need a bold coalition, similar to the one Allies created to defeat Hitler.@EPPGrouppic.twitter.com/Mg9d8zEkhX

In light of this latest ""Putin is Hitler!"" commentary out of Germany's defense minister, the below essay entitledDon’t Depict Putin, Kim, Assad And Others As Cartoon Villainsby Mila Ghorayeb atThe Mapleis worth revisiting...

Despite knowing better, people’s conception of a government or even an entire country often rests on the image of its leader. People thinking of the Canadian government, for example, now fixate on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Americans fixate on leaders as well, often usingtermslike “Trump’s America” to tie the climate of social relations to their president. The head of state becomes the state itself.

But it goes even further with countries that the governments of the United States and Canada are unfriendly with. In these cases, mainstream media, pop culture and politicians speak of their leaders not only like theyarethe country, but as though they’re cartoon villains.

Former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, famouslycalledthe “mad dog of the Middle East” by then U.S. President Ronald Reagan, had adocumentaryreleased about him post-mortem by the same name. Syrian President Bashar al-Assadisa “butcher” gone wild who supposedlyunleashedchemical weapons on an area his government had nearly retaken just because he’s full of bloodlust. Magazines are riddled with coversdepictingleaders, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, as people that simply want to watch the world burn.

As a result, those involved in political discourse lose sight of basic international relations analysis. These leaders aren’t treated as rational actors that, in turn with other members of their government, act based on strategy. They are portrayed as being motivated merely by destruction.

Part of the reason for this is that some think “rational” has a positive value judgment attached to it. That is, if we acknowledge behaviour as motivated by a strategic rationale, we’re excusing it. But it also fits into a long line of colonial tropes, reminiscent ofstandards of civilizationposited by European colonialists: the Global South is chaotic and uncivilized, giving Europeans entitlement to colonize these areas for their own good.

Today, the media portrays the good hegemons as democratic actors that solve their problems with level-headed strategy. Their enemies, meanwhile, are portrayed as erratic, hostile and rogue figures that will unexpectedly unleash violence simply because they can. As such, they can be portrayed as animals that need to be “tamed” orput down.

None of this is to say that these leaders aregood.You’d be hard-pressed to find politicians that have not (albeit in varying degrees) done gravely immoral things. But we should care about our ability to point out that these leaders aren’t just acting to cause chaos, because politics and journalism should be concerned with the truth. We need to confront things as they really are.

Unfortunately, many conversations about foreign policy don’t discuss anything real at all, instead becoming theatrical gestures of moral grandstanding: There’s a villain that needs to be slain in order to fix a country’s problems, and that’s that. One of the reasons for this is to conceal who are really the victims of war and sanctions. Few Canadians would enthusiastically support sanctions against Iran or Syria, for example, if they knew they’ddeeply depriveordinary citizens of basic needs. As a result, sanctions are portrayed as targeting someone cartoonishly evil enough that the visceral response is to want to put them down with whatever method the state department insists will work.

For example, a Gallant Foundation study,reportedon by the Yale Review of International Studies (YRIS) in 2018, found that U.S. print media compared Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler at least 1,035 times between August 1990 and February 1991, the period leading up to the Gulf War and through to its end. YRIS notes that the media narrative portrayed then-U.S. President George Bush as a brave hero confronting a “monster,” “beast” and “madman,” garnering American support for their government to attempt to remove Hussein from power.

North Korea is another case where cartoonishness is not only frequent, but the standard of reporting. Major outlets make baseless, often contradictory, claims, such as that all students in the country arerequiredto get the same haircut as Kim Jong Un, or that no one isallowedto. These claims inevitably getdebunked, yet leave the lasting impression that Kim is keeping an entire population subjugated not for any rational political motive, but to satiate absurd and borderline insane whims.

Of course, this kind of reporting is intended to do more than just entertain. If Kim is an unhinged monster that can’t be reasoned with, approaching North Korea with the utmost amount of aggression becomes justified. It makes Kim seem like a ticking time bomb that needs to be urgently confronted rather than diplomatically addressed. These efforts have worked, as analarming amountof Americans, for instance, support a nuclear strike that would kill a large chunk of North Korean civilians.

This narrative has also created widespread worry about Kim having access to nuclear weapons, with American leaders and analystspublishingdoom fantasies of an impending nuclear war. Some of this analysis will admit that Kim isn’t an irrational participant, but then still rests on a conception of him as a man with an unsatiated God-complex ruling over brainwashed individuals.

However, North Korea in recent history watched as Libyagave upits nuclear program only to have its government be overthrown shortly after, with Gaddafi being brutally sodomized and then murdered. North Koreasaw and learnedfrom this. As such, their nuclear program is a deterrent action by a rational state. This doesn’t make it a good government, but just means it’s capable of understanding state relations and making judgement calls for survival.

Further, mainstream media, pop culture and politicians need to stop oversimplifying the relationship between leaders our governments dislike and the citizens of their countries. The Communist Party of China, for instance, enjoysrelatively highlevels of support. Instead of careful reflection about what kind of policies make the party popular, along with other informative political metrics, it’s common to simplydismissthe Chinese population’s support for their government as a product of mass brainwashing. It’s hard for the media and onlookers to admit that the governments they demonize can simply enjoy popular support in a way that isn’t the result of a conspiracy.

Syria is another such case, wherepopular supportfor its oft-demonized leader is swept under the rug. To attempt to understand this support is met with accusations of apologism for Assad’s government. But there are factors relevant to Assad’s level of support that don’t revolve around his personality: the prevalence of terrorism, thepotential‘rally around the flag’ effect he may enjoy in the context of a war or the lack of a multi-sect opposition.

Admitting there are complex relationships between leaders and their population helps us ensure that we’re talking about something real in our political discourse.

I bring this up not because we need to praise or rehabilitate the personalities of world leaders. The intent is, rather, to point out that we place far too much emphasis on their personalities to begin with rather than the incentive structures that they, or their supporters, may be responding to. The solution is to instead strategically approach these incentive structures.

To be sure, the personalities of these individuals will play a role in their interactions with other leaders, but to make them the centrepiece is to obscure the conversation. We need to be able to talk about state behaviour and interactions without resorting to caricature, speculation and outright falsehoods.

To try and demystify what’s happening and wade through media sensationalism is not to exalt the media’s, or government’s, target. Rather, it’s an attempt to see things as they really are so that we can think for ourselves and come to organic conclusions.

2024-04-12 05:00:00,Stuck On Failure At The WHO,https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/stuck-failure-who,"Authored by Kevin Roberts and Robert Redfield via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Four years have passed since the onset of COVID-19 and the global mishandling of its spread. Now, the same governments and international organizations that lied about the last pandemic are negotiating a new pandemic agreement and amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) at the World Health Organization (WHO).

The main culprit hasn’t changed.Although the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has never been held accountable for its complete refusal to adhere to previous IHR agreements or its ongoing obstruction of a thorough investigation into the virus’s origins, Beijing is now collaborating with the Biden administration on this new accord.

So naturally, the new agreement advances China’s interests.Successive drafts focus on everything, from sending taxpayer dollars overseas to weakening intellectual property rights and empowering the WHO over the national sovereignty of the United States.Yes, that’s the same WHO that failed to insert a team of global experts in the first few weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak in China(as required by IHR), instead capitulating to the CCP and allowing it to define the international response.

The latest version of the agreement even mandates that parties provide financial and technical assistance to developing countries. Of course, the United States has a long, robust history of providing such assistance—President George W. Bush’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is one good example—but such assistance has always been voluntary, not obligatory.

Unsurprisingly, China stands to benefit from these provisions intended to help “poor” countries.Despite having the second-largest economy in the world, the United Nations considers China to be a “developing country.” That’s right. The country that started the COVID-19 pandemic will not only suffer zero consequences for its actions but, should the United States sign this agreement, stand to benefit from mandatory transfers of funds from U.S. taxpayers.

China would also benefit from other provisions in the agreement that push governments to promote “sustainable and geographically diversified production” of pandemic-related products (like vaccines), invest in developing country capacity and access to proprietary research, use the “flexibilities” of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights to override patents, and encourage rights holders to forego or reduce royalties and consider time-bound waivers of intellectual property rights.

China, notorious for its theft of intellectual property, would be sure to exploit this privilege.

All this would severely curtail future investment in health research—exactly the opposite incentive that should be applied if we are to be prepared for a future pandemic.And to make matters worse, the agreement almost entirely ignores addressing the countless shortcomings of current international processes in responding to pandemics,such as obligating governments to grant immediate access to international health expert teams to assess the threat of suspected outbreaks and to provide full and timely disclosure of genomic data.

Of course, overseeing sustainable and geographically diversified production, massive transfers, and distribution of up to 20 percent of diagnostics, therapeutics, or vaccines during a pandemic comes with a hefty price tag. The exact amount is not specified, but it is sure to include several commas.

In addition, the agreement would take a sledgehammer to American First Amendment free speech rights. The willingness of governments to use the pandemic to clamp down on unpopular ideas and opinions to “protect” public health and safety has proven durable.And this new agreement instructs governments to “cooperate, in accordance with national law, in preventing misinformation and disinformation.”China and Russia need no encouragement to censor speech. However, such language in an international agreement will encourage those in free countries who similarly wish to suppress unpopular opinions under the guise of countering misinformation and disinformation.

Indeed, the WHO itself seems offended by criticism.Earlier this year, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that negotiations were occurring in a very difficult environment, facing a “torrent of fake news, lies, and conspiracy theories.” Ironically, this argument was the same one used against conservatives who subscribed to the increasingly credible lab leak theory.

In short, the new pandemic agreement should alarm all Americans. It is far more focused on redistributing income, transferring technology, and weakening intellectual property than on preventing, detecting, and responding to pandemics in the first place. It failed to address the elephant in the room—the total lack of enforcement in the IHR—and as written, it is nothing short of a power grab by the CCP-controlled WHO.

Our government must wholly reject it.

2024-04-12 05:45:00,EU Parliament Refuses Decision On Budget Until Ukraine Gets More Patriots From Member States,https://web.archive.org/web/20240412105403/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/eu-parliament-refuses-decision-budget-until-ukraine-gets-more-patriots-member-states#comment-stream,"The latest intense Russian bombardment of Ukraine has resulted in the European Parliament taking the unprecedented decision todelay approval of the council budget until EU leaders get fully on board with approving additional Patriot air defense systemsfor Ukraine.

""What I find scandalous is that Europe, which is opening the door for Ukraine, and the European Council are not even capable in such an urgency to decide to send a number of anti-missile systems to Ukraine,""Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgian Prime Minister, said in a fiery speech from the parliament floor.

The decision to refuse discharge of the EU Council's budget was supported by 515 MEPs, with 62 voting against it—however, the effort will ultimately prove little more than symbolic and as but theatrics. European countries are still first and foremost worried about their dwindling defense stockpiles at home, especially as the specter of possible future major NATO-Russia war rises.

Russia'sovernight missile attacks, which reportedly included hypersonic missiles and drones sent against a number of power plants and natural gas facilities, resulted in a new urgent plea from President Volodymyr Zelensky, who post on X: ""We need air defense systems and other defense assistance,not just turning a blind eye and having lengthy discussions.""

Russia's President Putin on Thursday told national news agencies that Russia is obliged to strike Ukrainian energy sites in response to Kiev's ongoing cross-border attacks against Russia's own energy infrastructure. He also said these strikes on Ukraine's energy sitesaim to ""demilitarize"" the country.

MEP Verhofstadt's appeal was met with applause in the European parliamentsession:

Verhofstadt reminded that the EU's chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, told the MEPs that EU states have 100 Patriot air defense systems,while Ukraine asks for seven of them.

""We, Europeans, we invite them to come to theEuropean Union,but we are not capable to do so,"" Verhofstadt added.

The MEP proposed to withdraw the discharge of the EU Council's budget from the agendauntil a decision is taken to provide Ukraine with seven air defense systems.

Meanwhile, here's how a fresh Washington Post interviewbegan:

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wants the West’s extra, idle Patriot air defense batteries.And he’s not asking nicely anymore.

""Nice and quiet diplomacy didn’t work,""Kuleba, Kyiv’s top diplomat, told The Washington Post in an interview this week.

He told the newspaper that ultimately the country would need 26 Patriot batteries to secure the airspace over the whole country, but that an initial seven would go a long way in meeting the most pressing needs.

""I'm sorry to spoil the birthday party, but who can believe that the mightiest military alliance in the world cannot find seven batteries of Patriots to provide them to the only country in the world that is fighting ballistic attacks every day?"" he questioned provocatively.

2024-04-12 14:51:34,COVID Propaganda: Your Definitive Guide to Bird Flu Terror,https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-12/covid-propaganda-your-definitive-guide-bird-flu-terror,"Originally published viaArmageddon Prose:

The latest updates on the “new normal” – chronicling the lies, distortions, and abuses by the ruling class.

“How vast was the Great COVID Cover-up? Well,my investigation has recently discovered government officials from 15 federal agencies knew in 2018 that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was trying to create a coronavirus like COVID-19.

These officials knew that the Chinese lab was proposing to create a COVID 19-like virus and not one of these officials revealed this scheme to the public. In fact, 15 agencies with knowledge of this project have continuously refused to release any information concerning this alarming and dangerous research.

Government officials representing at least 15 federal agencies were briefed on a project proposed by Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

This project,the DEFUSE project, proposed to insert a furin cleavage site into a coronavirus to create a novel chimeric virus that would have been shockingly similar to the COVID-19 virus.

For years, I have been fighting to obtain records from dozens of federal agencies relating to the origins of COVID-19 and the DEFUSE project. Under duress, the administration finally released documents that show that the DEFUSE project was pitched to at least 15 agencies in January 2018.”

The Senator — who is hands-down the best nationally-elected representative on this issue, an all-too-low bar but a bar nonetheless — knows the obvious truth: the federal government wasn’t just aware of what was going on in Wuhan; itactively facilitatedthe creation of COVID-19 over many years, which — in combination with the mRNA shots marketed as “vaccines” (see: problem-reaction-solution) — represents the largest criminal conspiracy in world history.

That it’s still considered a revelation in 2024 that the government knew about COVID-19 in advance speaks to the negligence of the governing authorities in pursuing any sort of meaningful justice for those responsible, starting with Warlord Fauci himself.

That the demonic, sneering little gnome still wanders the corridors of power fat and happy while a former president is hounded to the ends of the Earth for over-valuing some real estate is, in and of itself, total damnation of the Department of Justice.

“A bird flu pandemic could be '100 times worse than Covid' and kill up to half of everyone it infects, experts have warned* — as the White House says it is 'monitoring' the situation.

Speaking at a briefing, virus researchers said the H5N1 strain of bird flu may now be getting 'dangerously close' to triggering a pandemic.”

*These are the same “experts” who wildly inflated COVID death projections to justify lockdowns, none of whom lost their jobs or their good standing in the anti-meritocratic Public Health™ cult. As long as they’re consistently wrong in one direction — catalyzing more power and prestige for the Public Health™ bureaucracy and pharmaceutical industry — they’re guaranteed to fail upwards.

“Multiple cases of the infection in a variety of mammals, including cows, cats and, more recently, humans, are all raising the risk of the virus mutating to become more transmissible, they said.

But others attending the briefing said it was too early to panic because there were still too many unknowns about recent cases to warrant sounding the alarm.

A White House representative said today it was tracking bird flu in the US, adding: 'We take the health and safety of the American people seriously.'”

As I have said in previousArmageddon Prosearticles — and this is not a feeling I am necessarily sure is moral; the thing about feelings is they are largely outside of conscious control — I am increasingly of the mind that if one is dumb enough to believe the U.S. government values the “health and safety of the American people,” it might be that one deserves to die.

“The panel was quickly convened off the heels of news thata dairy farm worker in Texas tested positive for the virus, alongside 12 herds of cows in six states and three cats also in Texas that subsequently died.

Testing done on the worker showed the patient's virus had already mutated to spread more easily— although the CDC said this mutation had been recorded before, that the risk was low and that there was no sign of human-to-human transmission.

The briefing was attended by bird flu researchers, doctors and officials from government agencies who were alarmed by the bird flu case in a human.”

Let’s assume that the positive bird flu tests are legitimate — and that’s a hell of an assumption given how reckless and inaccurate COVID PCR testing turned out to be. Is it true, then, that the mutations recorded were previously seen, or are they new? Are they natural or perhaps synthetic?

ViaWhite Coat Waste Project:

“CW investigators and Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) have now uncovered howthe U.S. Department of Agriculture has wasted at least $1 million of taxpayers’ money on an ongoing collaboration with the CCP-run Chinese Academy of Sciences (the Wuhan animal lab’s parent organization)and a Wuhan lab white coat to see if they can make ‘highly pathogenic avian influenza’ more contagious to mammalsin cruel and dangerous gain-of-function experiments…

Government records uncovered by WCW showthe taxpayer-funded USDA-CCP collaborationis currently scheduled to be funded through 2026. Itinvolves experiments that use the gain-of-function technique of repeatedly infecting ducks, geese, quail, and other animals with wild bird flu viruses to force the pathogens to evolve into unnatural lab-created strains and study their ‘potential to jump into mammalian hosts’…

The specific bird flu viruses being experimented on (H5NX, H7N9, and H9N2) are dangerous to humans and have already caused deadly outbreaks.

The main collaborators on the project are USDA’s Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, the CCP-run Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute (a Wuhan lab partner).”

Déjà vu! The parallels between the rollout of bird flu and COVID-19 are nothing short of stunning.

CDC Director and petty tyrant whobragged on camera in publicabout arbitrarily enforcing lockdowns on the peasants regarding whether they would be “allowed to have professional football,” Mandy Cohen, recently revealed that the industry had already developed bird flu “vaccines” ready to be deployed on the public at any time.

“’The CDC says the risk to humans from the H5N1 flu that is driving this outbreak is low,’ NPR host Ari Shapiro toldCDC Director Mandy Cohenon Wednesday. ‘Right now, it appears that the two cases in humans were from contact with sick animals. Do you have any reason to believe that humans could pass this on to each other?’

‘So we have never seen a case of human-to-human spread of avian flu here in the United States, and the version of avian flu that we’re seeing in cattle and in this one human case is the same strain that we have seen previously in birds,’ Cohen replied. ‘We’ve never seen that spread human to human.’

‘That all being said,’she added, ‘as we’ve learned through COVID and our experiences, viruses change, and we need to stay ahead of it. That’s why we at CDC and the whole of U.S. government is taking this very seriouslyand monitoring the situation very closely.’…

‘The good news is the United States has been preparing for avian flu outbreaks for more than 20 years,’ Cohen said. ‘We’ve invested in our ability to test for this, to prevent it and to treat it. And we know that the strain we’re seeing right now is the same strain we have seen before. Tests will pick this up.’

‘Our treatment, which is Tamiflu, which we have both doses in stockpile and around the country, works,’she said. ‘And we even have vaccine candidates that are ready to go. So it’s very different than what we experienced, for example, at the beginning of COVID, when we were seeing a brand-new, novel virus where we didn’t have tests, we didn’t have treatment and we didn’t have vaccine.’”

What we have going on here appears to be an old-fashioned, problem-reaction-solution technocratic two-fer:

·       Expansion of the power and authority of the biomedical terror state

·       Elimination of undesirable portions of the food supply (chickens, turkeys) for Climate Change™

… with many other ancillary benefits, of course, doled out to collaborators to keep all relevant parties placated and in line — including, potentially, a mass mail-in voting push/mandate approaching the 2024 election to facilitate greater tomfoolery with the count and push the Brandon entity’s rotting corpse over the finish line one last time, a further excuse to crack down on the “domestic terrorists” who resist the new round of lockdowns and mandates, etc. The social control and profiteering applications are nearly limitless.

Welcome back. My name is Ben Nadelstein. I’m joined by the General Counsel of Monetary Metals, Jeff Deist. Jeff, how are you doing this morning?

Ben, I am fantastic. How are you?

Jeff, what’s on your mind? We’ve seen a lot of headlines recently with gold. Wanted to get your take.

Yeah, I’ve been following a lot of the big gold social media accounts and just some of the general commentary around what’s behind the price increase, especially in Q1 2024. And there’s a lot of different theories about it. But there’s also some real discrepancies in the sense that in the West, we see a pretty slim demand for physical. If you talk to the actual bullion dealers, there’s not a lot of people buying in the West. We also see outflows from ETFs in the West. And generally, Western financial advisors, by West, I basically mean Western Europe and the US, Western financial advisors are still, for the most part, advising, let’s say, a 1% position, whether that’s in physical or whether that’s in some paper ETF or future, whatever it might be.

We have to understand where is this price action. I think a lot of it, obviously, is in central bank buying. There are some good people to follow if you’re interested in that. A friend of mine named Mike Mahari, who works forMoneyMetals Exchange, follows that, and you can follow him on Twitter, for example. But there’s also probably some churn in the paper futures market, to be sure.

But I think a lot of this to the fact that all of our old understandings about gold might be out the window. What do I mean by that? What I mean by that is I think we’re entering a new era, and we haven’t been in anything like this, really, for over 40 years. I’m talking about basically the early 1980s until right about COVID, till about 2022, we had a four-decade period of declining interest rates. When we’re talking about gold, people talk about whether it’s a safe haven. Whether it’s inflation hedge and all these other things.

What I’m suggesting, I don’t know, but what I’m suggesting is we might be entering an era where the underlying price of gold is decoupled from a lot of these fundamentals to which we tied it in the past. In other words, what if in this new era, the price of gold is no longer tied to interest rates, whether it’s central bank rates, prime rates, commercial rates, whatever you want to look at, overnight lending rates? What if it’s no longer tied to CPI? What if it’s no longer tied to the equity and bond markets or GDP or unemployment or general sentiment?

In other words, there’s all kinds of ways that gold might be decoupling from all of these standard metrics. I would argue that that is because it is increasingly seen as a safe haven asset. I think a safe haven is a very different thing than an inflation hedge per se.

One way to think about that is when When you say inflation, people think CPI. There would be an easy metric to test, which would be the CPI versus the gold price. If there was some correlation, whether that’s causation or correlation, between the gold price rising or falling and CPI rising or falling. If one stays stagnant, ideally with this framework or this narrative, the other should stay stagnant. When you look at gold prices, that’s hard to see in the data.

One might say that in the 1970s, when there was high inflation and gold prices were rising, that could just be the gold price leaving its bottled up price fix when it was actually fixed at an amount per dollar, and then just exploding to where the market price or the market clearing price should have been all those years. That’s one argument in the ’70s, yes, inflation and gold moved together, but that’s just because of other reasons, not because of CPI inflation. Then the ’80s and ’90s, that correlation, not super strong. You see inflation, but gold prices don’t necessarily track the same way. Then in the 2000s and in the 2010s, again, that story there breaks down.

Now, of course, in the 2020s, there’s a question of, Okay, we’ve had high inflation in the beginning of the 2020s. Gold price stayed relatively slow and stagnant.

Now in the 2024s, you’re seeing a rise in gold price hitting all-time highs, while inflation is not reaching new all-time highs. And some people think cooling. Paul Krugman famously saying, Everything but your food, shelter, energy, anything that you could buy. That’s all cooling. But it seems like there is a disconnect with inflation.

Another narrative has been, Okay, well, yes, maybe gold doesn’t move with inflation. It’s not an inflation hedge, but maybe it moves with interest rates, whether real interest rates or just nominal interest rates. And again, I think in 2024, that narrative has been not debunked for certain, but that decoupling, like you mentioned, is seemingly much more likely because with 5.5% target Fed funds rate at the peak, we’ve seen the gold price rise. And so most analysts say gold has no income And so the opportunity cost of holding gold while treasuries, T-bills or bonds pay five and a half %, clearly on the margin, investors might think, Well, maybe I’ll jump into T-bills. Maybe I’ll sell some gold.

Now, at Monetary Metals, we do pay a yield on gold paid in gold. So now there is an interest rate in gold. Again, it’s unaffected by the Federal Reserve and the federal reserve’s interest rate. So for some investors, that actually might be something where they say, Well, if I can earn 5 % or 3 % or 2 % on gold, that matters much less what the federal funds rate or the target rate is.

And then, of course, there’s that question of store of value, purchasing power, which I think most people weren’t born in the 1900s, so they don’t have an affinity for a 25 cent can of soup for a 50 cent stake. And so that’s maybe not a strong argument. So this flight to safety might be the new narrative. Where do you see investors or other clients thinking, Okay, if I’m looking for a flight to safety, maybe people are looking at Bitcoin. But how do you see gold in that in that new light?

Well, I think that the safe haven concept for owning gold is more powerful than the inflation hedge. Now, I’ll go back to a couple of the metrics you mentioned. I mean, if we go back historically, gold has not always tracked inflation point by point. The other problem in that understanding is that there’s more than one inflation. Our friend Lynn Alden wrote a great article documenting three kinds of inflation, basically price inflation, asset price inflation, and monetary inflation. We have to talk about which kind we’re talking about. When even Larry Somers, of all people, comes out and says, The way we used to calculate CPI back in the ’70s and ’80s, we applied that today, it’d be a lot higher. Let’s say real price inflation. When you consider insurance and housing and tuition, medical care, go try to get homeowners insurance. If you’re a renter, guess what? Your landlord is going to have that reflected in your rent. There’s a lot of ways in which prices really are going up. We might argue cynically that the government is not very truthful and that real inflation is something more like 10%. If you look at it that way, even gold’s 2024 rise is not all that great as an inflation hedge.

We have to understand what we’re talking about. Keith Wiener is also quick to point out a lot of this is COVID-related. Supply chain shutdowns, what he calls mandatory useless ingredients, things that green energy require, that thing. There’s lots of reasons for prices to go up apart from the per se fiscal or monetary machinations of any government or central bank. We got to understand that as well. Inflation is not such a simple thing to understand. If we flip that mentality a little bit to the safe haven idea. I mean, an inflation hedge is a particular asset that is supposed to to go up in value against or ahead of inflation. A safe haven asset, by contrast, and there can be a lot of overlap, it can be the same asset in some cases, but a safe haven asset, we can define more as an asset that performs well in some, not catastrophic, but some problematic financial turmoil. A crash of 2008 and a crash of 1987, an event like 9/11, an event like COVID. We all understand the safe haven concept.

Actually, Mark Spitznagel, who runs the hedge fund Universa, that’s called a tail risk fund.

It’s a very unique and mathematical beast. But nonetheless, his central thesis, as a matter of fact, his most recent book is called Safe Haven. If you can plow through the math, which was a little challenging for me, you could actually apply a lot of his insights into your own personal investing. But the idea here is that if you keep your losses to a minimum, year after year after year after year, when that black swan or terrible event comes along, you make a killing that more than covers all of your small losses over the years. As a hedge fund manager, that’s tough. You got to have clientele who are willing to stick with you, but because of Spitznagel’s track record, he does have that clientele. When COVID came along in March of 2020, Q1 of 2020, at least one of Spitznagel’s funds made something like 4,000 % of in a single quarter. That’s a unique game, and it’s probably not something that most average investors want in their personal life. We all want to sleep at night. Mark Spitznagel is obviously a brilliant quant. We’re all not wired like that.

But still the safe haven concept, the idea that, Hey, look, I don’t have to be some perma bear.

I don’t have to think gold’s going to 5,000. That might be a very unpleasant world where it did. I don’t have to think that the world is going to get so tired of Congress’s deficits, and they’re going to stop buying our treasury debt and treasury is going to have to offer junk bond rates to get anyone to buy this crap. We don’t have to believe that there’s going to be a catastrophic implosion in the dollar or hyperinflation. We don’t have to believe that there is going to be a severe economic depression in the US or the West. We don’t have to believe any of these things to own a safe haven asset. We just have to believe that in history, these things have happened.

If you If you want to protect yourself and your family, it might be worthwhile to hold something that you think is going to perform well in that scenario.

I think one way to frame this is, okay, let’s say there’s a new rule coming out saying, we’re no longer allowed to use Ubers or Airbnbs in Seattle or New York City, and that’s very plausible. You can understand why the price of those services could go up. Why the gold price would appreciate on that news is unclear to me. I’m not sure what the causation would be or even the correlation.

Now, something like the depreciation of thecurrency, the Lira in Turkey, I could see where the gold price actually does have a one-to-one causation, or if you want to say, correlation with the price of the Lira going down or the price of gold going up. So I could understand that. And that would, to me, seem like a safe haven narrative, which is that you are trying to save yourself from the debacement of the currency of the lira and much less likely to say, well, Uber and Airbnb are more expensive. Therefore, why is my gold price not increase it.

Well, the other thing is you have to take a long-term view. Calamities can unfold over a decade. They can unfold over two decades. How do you define a calamity? 9/11 is a calamity. But what’s happened to the Turkish people over the last 10 years? I mean, you go back to 2011, a little more than a decade ago, the Lira was basically 2 to 1 against the Euro. Fast forward to 2024, it has gotten as high as about 20 to 1 against the Euro. So I would argue that that’s a calamity. I would argue that if you were a Turk and throughout all those years, you had been converting your paycheck from Lira into gold, you’d be, relative to your compatriots, a happier camper today.

The idea of a safe haven asset doesn’t always have to mean some immediate or instant shock. It can mean a long-term trend. On that point, let me read you a quote. This is from our friend John Hathaway at Sprott. Now, he’s talking about there’s a new understanding, which I would argue is accelerating, even since 2008, when a lot of Americans really started to question the banking system, the US dollar, the fairness of the economy, inequality, the housing, whether I’m ever going to be able to buy a house, whether I’m ever going to be able to retire.

I mean, that was a real period of reckoning, I think, for the American psyche. Let’s not forget gold markets, physical and paper. They’re a reflection of human beings, even traders, even algorithmic traders, because someone programmed the algorithm. They’re not these hyper rational robots. They have a psyche, they have greed, they have fear, they have all kinds of behaviors baked in. That’s the market, in which we have to respect the market and its signals and what it’s telling us.

Over time, as these body blows to the US psyche build, in my opinion, in any way, Iraq and Afghanistan didn’t go too well. We had the housing prices of 2008. We’ve had COVID lockdowns. We’ve had a lot of shocks over the past couple of decades. Over time, people begin to wonder, is the United States and its economy and its dollar even its military, are these paper tigers of a sort? Here’s John Hathaway. It’s probably this loss of trust in the US dollar is a safe and useful asset, is no longer a hypothetical concern. Now, I certainly agree with Brent Johnson and Santiago about the immediate or near term futures of the dollar. But I might agree with John Hathaway on the long term.

So he says abandonment of the US dollar is a reality. The pace is picking up steam. Maybe. But there are numerous potential catalysts for the general Russia and the gold by the investment mainstream. A few include the intractable fiscal position of the US. I believe that. All things geopolitical, resurgence of inflation connected to rising oil prices, an impotent and mistake-prone Fed. That is not the way people talked about the Fed when I was a young person. An unnerving setback in the overvalued and over concentrated stock market, the investment public may no longer remain asleep to these risks.

Sometimes things can be accumulated. I think that was what happened in Turkey. They borrowed an awful lot of money at the governmental level in Euro and dollars, not in Lira. They use those to fund huge infrastructure projects like airports and highways and all that. That boosts your GDP. People were talking about the Turkish economy, ’09, ’10, ’11, but then when the bills come due. You get the sense that there’s a fatigue amongst the American public, especially when they’re out seeing their paycheck price slower than inflation or their networth rise, lower than inflation. I think a lot of these body blows go to the psyche of the gold market. I think they’re reflected there.

We mentioned, you don’t have to be a catastrophic doomsayer to say, Hey, I think it might be a good reason to have some gold in a portfolio. If this safe haven narrative continues to come to fruition. One of those is the price appreciation of gold over time. The other is the diversification benefit, and of course, the income opportunities through companies like Monetary Metals. What are some of your final thoughts here on terms of the inflation hedge versus the safe haven value or the safe haven narrative as we come into 2024 and 2024 heading into 2025?

Well, I definitely think the safe haven narrative is stronger because I think that the inflation hedge is just empirically, historically not 100% accurate. I mean, it’s somewhat correlated, but it’s not precisely correlated. But more importantly, obviously, we in this company and a lot of people in our broader community, we want to see gold retain or regain some of its role in the global monetary system as a financial asset, as a monetary asset. I don’t think governments or central banks are going to go back to agold standardanytime soon. I do think the real competitor or the real wrestling match at this point is between gold and Bitcoin. My thoughts on that are a little different than Keith Wiener’s, but nonetheless, I’m a very avid spectator.

I think the idea that there’s, at today’s dollar price, some $15 trillion worth of gold, apart from the paper market, just laying around that could be a highly productive asset in the economy, whether they’re being used as collateral, whether they’re being used as finance for production, whatever it might be. In other words, pulling some of that monetary value out of gold. I’ll finish with this. I do think gold still has monetary value in the public’s mind, in central bankers’ mind.

That’s, I think, proven in the marketplace for a very simple reason. Why does gold trade, it’s some $2,300 per ounce as of today’s show taping. Well, if gold had no monetary value, as Ben Bernanke famously told Ron Paul, Well, some of the banks just hold it because of tradition. Ron said, Why don’t they hold diamonds? It still has some monetary value, and I think that’s proved by this. If we reduced it simply to its use value as a commodity, which would basically be jewelry and industrial uses, would gold fetch $2,300 US? I think the answer to that is no.

So there’s some premium baked in that the market sets for its monetary use above and beyond its mere commodity uses. And so that monetary use reflects this idea of maybe an inflation hedge, reflects this idea of a store of value, reflects the idea that central banks hold it, reflects the idea that it historically has never really gone to zero. It reflects It’s the idea that gold is very, very liquid. It’s as liquid, at least in an ETF or something, it’s as liquid as your stocks and bonds. It’s certainly more liquid than real estate."
2024-04-12 17:49:11,American Debacle,https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-12/american-debacle,"America still has some of the best scientists, engineers, and inventors in the world--probably more than any other country--and it's still a great place to be rich. I was reminded of that a couple of weeks ago when I saw a tiny jet I didn't recognize taking off from Teterboro Airport. Looking it up later, it was aCirrus Vision Jet. If you have a few million dollars burning a hole in your pocket, you can buy the world's first flying luxury SUV from this Wisconsin-based company, complete with a ""safe return"" button that automatically lands the plane, and a built-in parachute in case of engine failure.

The contrast between this successful personal jet maker and theongoing calamities at Boeingsuggests that while we can still do great things, we can no longer do big things well. Another example of that appears to be our failure to clear the wreckage of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, as ""Armchair Warlord"" pointed out on X earlier today.

The MV Dali collided with the Key Bridge in Baltimore three weeks ago and so little has been done for remediation that if this was happening in Russia or China we'd have people writing Ph.D dissertations on this website about poor state capacity and shaken trust in ""regimes.""⬇️…pic.twitter.com/9WkuVJNWfz

Here's the full text of his post:

The MV Dali collided with the Key Bridge in Baltimore three weeks ago and so little has been done for remediation that if this was happening in Russia or China we'd have people writing Ph.D dissertations on this website about poor state capacity and shaken trust in ""regimes.""

Let's look at the current status of things three weeks in:

Let's pause for a moment to contrast this with Russia's Crimean Bridge, the longest in Europe, which,per Wikipedia, was completed within four years of its contract being awarded. And when spans of the bridge were destroyed by Ukrainian attacks, in each case, the bridge was fully repaired and reopened within months.

Back to Armchair Warlord:

Let's be real - if this had happened in China the port would have been open in days and construction on a replacement span would be underway as we speak. This incident is beginning to illustrate the decline in the real state capacity of the United States of America in the starkest possible terms.

It's hard to argue against that. Not only does America today struggle with large infrastructure projects, it also can't defeat a bunch of Houthi rebels, despite having the largest navy in the world. If only the men running our government and Boeing were as talented as the ones building personal jets.

Last night, we posted our top ten names for this week, the ones our system estimates will perform the best over the next six months.

We also posted the performance of our top ten names from six months ago.

On average our top ten names from October 5th were up 61.35% over the next six months, versus up 22.62% for SPY.

That was our tenth top names cohort in a row to beat the market.Since we launched our trading Substack at the end of 2022, forty of our top names cohorts have completed their six-month runs. Of them, thirty have beaten the market.

2024-04-12 19:40:00,The Freedom That Once Was The Internet,https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/freedom-once-was-internet,"Authored by Jeffrey A. Tucker via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

It’s time to declare as regards the internet of old:Requiescat in Pace.

It’s dead. We might as well face it.

Nearly every large application and website in existence, meaningmost of what people use on what we call the internet, constituting an estimated 95 percent of the main portals of information, is now compromised by some power somewhere, making them no longer part of the free world and no longer part of the army of truth.

If that shocks you, you haven’t used Google or Facebook recently. They are both heavily rigged not to get you the information you want but rather to push out to you information that someone somewhere wants you to have. And the situation is getting worse, not better. This is despite impending court challenges that are hoping for a restoration of free speech. If there were a serious threat that this would happen, wouldn’t we see the censored venues improve and not worsen?

The situation is heartbreaking and gives rise to melancholic reflections on the promise and betrayal.

My fear is thathardly anyone remembers a time when the internet held out the highest hope in modern history for the emancipation of humanity from the control of the powerful.I had a model in my own head of a mass migration out of the controlled and regulated physical world and into a digital realm that was so large, so potentially infinite in scope, containing so many nodes and so many content providers, that states would be hopeless in the face of it.

Yes, I was the paradigmatic case of the techno-utopian who got bitten by the bug of progress in about 1996. I was sitting there at my desk, newly aware of these things called websites, and managing one myself. I put up a few old issues of a newsletter. A few days later, I needed to look at that newsletter. I saw it sitting across the room. At that moment, I suddenly realized that it would actually be easier just to look at it online.

Now, you might laugh when you hear that story.But keep in mind that at that point in history, most people had no idea of the extent of the power of this tool. I did not. I knew that I could post things and they would appear on a screen. But it wasn’t until that moment that it suddenly dawned on me. By posting anything online, I could liberate any bit of information from the physical world, in which only I could have access so long as I was sitting there, and give that same piece of information to millions and billions of people, possibly forever.

I did a deep intake of air in a state of shock and amazement. I immediately knew what my task was. I was determined to get every valuable piece of content in my possession and scan and post in every possible format. I was surrounded by out-of-print items of every sort. I got to work, piece by piece, putting it all up there for the world. I knew it would likely take me the rest of my career to do this but it was joyful work, work that would free the world. I would do my part.

It was two years later when a friend wrote me:“I have the name of a new search engine you absolutely have to try.”

“What’s wrong with AltaVista?” I asked.

“Nothing but this one is far better. It’s called Google.”

Sure enough, it was better. We all adopted Google as a friend. And it was for a very long time. It only improved day by day, and eventually solve the problem of email spam that was the biggest threat to software functioning at the time.

In those days, those of us playing with all these new tools felt like insiders and revolutionaries.We learned to code. We ate and slept HTML, and later learned to separate content and presentation with style sheets. We learned to manage servers and then build online databases to economize on processes to avoid tangles. We played with image formats and sizes. We learned about maximizing speed and search engine access. Every day, we learned a new trick and deployed it.

Goodness, those were heady times.We wore thumb drives from strings around our necks and were constantly plugged in, as builders of the new world.

We felt like we were part of a community, a global one, with the same ideals. Information naturally wanted to be free, we theorized and we believed, and it was up to us to make that happen. Nothing could stop us, not even governments. With unbreakable encryption not even backdoors to servers could do the trick. I ended up writing two full books on the thesis that the more we digitize everything, the freer we would become.

Truth is that everything around us seemed to confirm this view.Social media came along as did video services and free video calling plus every form of instant message to connect us instantly with anyone on the planet. When translation tools became available, even language barriers were breaking down.

My scanning and publishing projects had gone on hyperdrive. I put in several thousand books plus old journals plus diaries plus newsletters and magazines. And I cooperated with teams around the world to make them into digital books and then print books and searchable databases. The universe of information we were creating scaled and scaled and there seemed to be no limit to the abundance of connectivity and information that would pass through these magical tubes that were connecting the planet from one end to the other, regardless of nation states.

Was it always an illusion? Probably.The point is that the internet at its height was built by people (like me) who believed in it and worked toward achieving the ideal.

The ideal became gradually compromised over time. Copyright claims wrecked the idea of putting all knowledge online, as the Google Books program quickly discovered. Patent claims stopped the development of new tools, and did their part to consolidate the industry. Gradually what led to institutional power on the internet was not use or innovation but war chests of claims of “intellectual property.”

Such claims were inherently at war with what the internet wanted to be.I joined a band of brothers and sisters who were going to get rid of such old-fashioned rules and replace them with new ones,including file sharing apps and open declarations of Creative Commons licensing. Indeed, we had everything solved, a perfect way forward.

We forget one thing: the long historical trajectory of powerful states and their powerful corporate allies to work together to consolidate control and exploit the rest of humanity. As it turned out, there was no technical solution to that problem, no code, no app, no legal trick, no innovation, and not even a mass movement. The cartels got busy to regain control.

I’m going to date this new period of consolidation from about 2012 onward. It’s hard to say exactly when it all took shape but it was at some point during the Obama years.The antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft was the warning shot: play ball with the state or we will break you up. That threat is still with us.

Looking back, it’s clear that some people in government and corporate boardrooms simply declared: this new freedom that people think they have cannot work for stabilizing our power. We have to bring it to an end. The new world will operate more like the old.

The victory of Brexit in the UK and the election of Donald Trump in 2016 terrified elites the world over, and these seemed to be backed by growing populist movements far and wide. It was at this point that powerful interests simply decided that internet freedom had not worked for their interests. They decided to declare it to be over.

There were three steps in this process.

First, consolidate the industries, so that we only have to deal with a few rather than many: Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and a few others. Have them buy up any and all innovative competitors and either rope them into their operations or shut them down completely.

Second, erect high regulations in the industryto make sure that these main players are permanent and not challenged anymore by punks in a garage somewhere.

Third, embed regime-sympathetic managers and investors at these institutionsand gradually turn them from serving the public to serving the regime.

The lockdown games of 2020 and following were their chance to deploy their new machine of censorship and control to see just how well they worked to propagandize the population. As it turns out, they worked pretty well. And that leaves only one last step: criminalize all speech that contradicts that which is approved.

That is happening in Brazil. The United States is next. China is the model of control.

Fortunately and for now, the work of many of us from the past survives in various forms but for how long? It is clear where we are headed. The power elite want the internet to work exactly like media of old: three channels saying all the same thing forever.

Will they get away with it? So far it is working. Of the internet dreams of old, we can say: The dream was betrayed at multiple levels and in ways is worthy of great novels.

To gain full control of the internet as a means of managing the public mind, however, is going to take far more than consolidation and surreptitious infiltration. To complete the task will require a level of population coercion on a scale we’ve never seen in history. Possible? Doubtful.

As for the dream of achieving freedom itself, we will always say: “Per aspera ad astra.”

2024-04-12 20:20:00,School District Takes Next Step In Ditching Seattle Gifted Program,https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/school-district-takes-next-step-ditching-seattle-gifted-program#comment-stream,"Authored by Jason Rantz via mynorthwest.com(emphasis ours),

Privileged progressives, donning their white knight armor, are in the next phase of a plan to end Seattle Public Schools’ gifted students program— known locally as its Highly Capable Cohort (HCC). They complainedthe HCC was too white.

HCC separates academically gifted students from others via different classrooms or entirely different schools. But in 2020, white Seattle school board directors voted to terminate the HCC over the objections of parents.HCC will be completely phased out by the 2027-28 school year.

Outraged more by the success of white and Asian students than by the untapped potential of black and Hispanic pupils,progressives would rather drag achievers down than elevate everyone.These self-proclaimed saviors boast on social media about tackling inequities, oblivious to the harm they inflict. Indeed, the program to replace the HCC, and be implemented ineveryclassroom, ensures that gifted students will be unchallenged, struggling students will escape the attention they deserve and teachers will be overwhelmed. In other words, everyone will be equitably harmed.

More from Jason Rantz:Seattle English students told it’s ‘white supremacy’ to love reading, writing

Critics argued the students in HCC did not reflect the diversity of the community. The move was prompted by Black Lives Matter activism.

In 2018, three years after Seattle Public Schools (SPS) hired an “equity specialist” to address so-called racial inequities,thestudentsHCC served 13% multiracial, 11.8% Asian, 3.7% Hispanic and 1.6% black.(By 2023, it was 20% multiracial, 16% Asian, 8.2% Hispanic and 3.4% black.)Critics argue that because the HCC didn’t match the district’s diversity, the program was irredeemably racist and needed to be dismantled.

But parents, including those who are black, Asian and Hispanic, arguedagainstclosing them down. They argued thatSPS should work harder to identify minority students who are eligible for HCC, rather then kill the program entirely.

One father pleaded that the Seattle School Board “consider the disservice you would be doing to the minorities that are already in the HCC program.” He argued that the gifted program “does more for Black children, particularly Black boys, than it does for their peers.”

But the extremist Seattle School Board was unmoved.

Then-director Chandra Hampsonaccusedblack parents supporting the HCC as being “tokenized” by white Seattle parents.

The “whole-classroom model” is replacing HCC and be implemented in each classroom starting in the 2024-25 school year.It’s unworkable.

2024-04-12 20:40:00,Hummer Reportedly Kills EV Base 2 Trim Level As Demand Cools,https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/hummer-reportedly-kills-ev-base-2-trim-level-demand-cools,"In the latest setback, General Motors has ditched the base trim level for the Hummer EVs, according to a new report from the autoblogGM Authority. The legacy automaker has delayed and slowed its EV initiative in recent months as the industry continues to slide.

GM Authority has learned that there will be no ""base"" 2 trim level for the Hummer EV, as was originally announced. As background, the 2 trim was supposed to arrive for the 2024 model year for both the Hummer EV Pickup and Hummer EV SUV, but it seems as though theautomaker changed its plans. Moving forward, there will beno 2 model for the 2025 model year.

For GM guys and gals who were promised Hummer EVs with base trims and lower prices (starting around  $79,995 and offer 250 miles of range), the report from GM Authority does not bode well for EV price affordability.

This also comes as GM delayed the launch of its Toledo EV Propulsion Systems plant in Ohio by nine months. It will start operating in late 2024. GM said it will ""retime the launch of Electric Drive Unit at the plant to Q4 2024 in order to better align with Orion Assembly's planned production schedule.""

Furthermore, GM has announced production delays of EV trucks at its Orion assembly until late 2025, including the Chevy Silverado RST and GMC Sierra Denali EVs.

Consumer appetite for EVs is rapidly cooling. And legacy automakers have felt the brunt of the slowdown.

Last week, Ford Motor said it was postponing production of a new three-row SUV as it pushes the delivery date from late 2025 to 2026 and will focus on hybrid options across its entire North American lineup.

Even Tesla Motors, the leader in the EV space, is experiencing a slowdown in sales.

""Tesla is going from the golden era to a really challenging era,"" said Mark Fields, a former CEO of Ford Motor.

As legacy automakers face waning demand and mounting delays in debuting EV SUVs and trucks, Tesla's Cybertruck is in massive demand, and production is being ramped up.

2024-04-12 21:20:00,"Buying Votes: Biden Cancels Student Debt For 277,000 Borrowers Ahead Of Presidential Elections",https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/buying-votes-biden-cancels-student-debt-277000-borrowers-ahead-presidential-elections#comment-stream,"On Friday, President Joe Bidenannouncedthat he would cancel the federal student debt of more than 277,000 Americans, equating to about $7.4 billion. This would bring the total of what is considered classical vote buying ahead of the November presidential elections to more than $153 billion, or forgiving the debt of 4.3 million people.

The majority of the 277,000 Americans who were forgiven federal student debt were enrolled in thegovernment's income-driven repayment plan, known as SAVE, which promises borrowers to forgive their debts after ten years of loan repayments.

The White House touted:

Since President Biden took office, his administration has approved over $54 billion in debt cancellation for 1.3 million borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment plans, including the new SAVE Plan. This builds on additional actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to cancel debt for nearly 900,000 public service workers, 1.3 million borrowers cheated by their schools or borrowers covered by related court settlements, and nearly 550,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability, including many veterans.

Earlier this week, the Biden administration announced new student loan plans that would begin canceling federal student debt up to $20,000 in interest for millions of borrowers and total loan forgiveness for millions more. Those who qualify for the government'sincome-driven repayment planwould have the full balance of their unpaid interest forgiven, benefiting at least 25 million Americans.

""This latest round of debt cancellation comes on the heels of President Biden announcing new plans that, if implemented, would cancel student debt for over 30 million Americans when combined with actions the Administration has taken over the last three years,"" the White House said.

Meanwhile, aseven-state coalitionfiled a new lawsuit on Monday challenging the ""most generous ever"" federal student loan repayment plan.

In the complaint filed in federal court in Missouri, the seven states argued that SAVE is another unlawful attempt to force taxpayers to shoulder the bill for others.

""Just last year, the [U.S.] Supreme Court struck down an attempt by the President to force teachers, truckers, and farmers to pay for the student loan debt of other Americans—to the enormous tune of $430 billion,"" the states wrote in the complaint, explaining how the high court's 6-3 majority explicitly ruled that the president shall not sidestep Congress in making a decision that could have a significant impact on the economy.

""Undeterred, the President is at it again, even bragging that the Supreme Court blocked it. They blocked it. But that didn't stop me,'"" the complaint added.

The administration's latest student debt push is a sign of desperation. It comes as Bidenomics has been a gigantic failure and risks causing a sovereign debt crisis.Gold's push to record highs is figuring this one out.

Now that rate cuts are off the table, interest on US debt - currently the second biggest government outlay at $1.1 trillion - will surpass social security and become the single biggest US expense before the end of 2024 at $1.6 trillion.pic.twitter.com/OQYjHhOks9

Also,inflation has been reacceleratingfor months while nationwide gasoline pump prices inch closer to thepolitically sensitive $4 level. And if the inflation storm wasn't enough, the nation has been swamped by a White House-facilitated illegal alien invasion as progressive cities burn under failed social justice reforms.

What's worse, the Biden administration's foreign policy has been an epic disaster as the world moves closer to World War III in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Still, don't forget about what's happening in the Pacific.

This is why the White House must buy votes...

What better way to distract voters about the failures of this administration and the inflation storm crushing the working poor than to distract with socialist policies of 'free stuff' - such as canceling student loan debt...

2024-04-12 21:40:00,Did Lockdowns Set A Global Revolt In Motion?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/did-lockdowns-set-global-revolt-motion#comment-stream,"Authored by Jeffrey Tucker via TheBrownstone Institute,

My first article on the coming backlash - admittedly wildly optimistic - went toprintApril 24, 2020.

After 6 weeks of lockdown, I confidently predicted a political revolt, a movement against masks, a population-wide revulsion against the elites, a demand to reject “social distancing” and streaming-only life,plus widespread disgust at everything and everyone involved.

I was off by four years.I wrongly assumed back then that society was still functioning and that our elites would be responsive to the obvious flop of the whole lockdown scheme. I assumed that people were smarter than they proved to be. I also did not anticipate just how devastating the effects of lockdown would be: in terms of learning loss, economic chaos, cultural shock, and the population-wide demoralization and loss of trust.

The forces that set in motion those grim days were far more deep than I knew at the time. They involved a willing complicity from tech, media, pharma, and the administrative state at all levels of society.

There is every evidence that it was planned to be exactly what it became; not just a foolish deployment of public health powers but a “great reset” of our lives. The newfound powers of the ruling class were not given up so easily, and it took far longer for people to shake off the trauma than I had anticipated.

Is that backlash finally here? If so, it’s about time.

New literature is emerging to document it all.

The new book“White Rural Rage: The Threat to American Democracy” is a viciously partisan, histrionic, and gravely inaccurate account that gets nearly everything wrong but one: vast swaths of the public are fed up, not with democracy but its opposite of ruling class hegemony.

The revolt is not racial and not geographically determined. It’s not even about left and right, categories that are mostly a distraction. it’s class-based in large part but more precisely about the rulers vs. the ruled.

With more precision, new voices are emerging among people who detect a “vibe change” in the population.

One is Elizabeth Nickson’s article “Strongholds Falling; Populists Seize the Culture.”

She argues, quoting Bret Weinstein, that:

“The lessons of [C]ovid are profound.The most important lesson of Covid is that without knowing the game, we outfoxed them and their narrative collapsed.... The revolution is happening all over the socials, especially in videos. And the disgust is palpable.”

A second article is “Vibe Shift” by Santiago Pliego:

“The Vibe Shift I’m talking about isthe speaking of previously unspeakable truths, the noticing of previously suppressed facts.I’m talking about the give you feel when the walls of Propaganda and Bureaucracy start to move as you push; the very visible dust kicked up in the air as Experts and Fact Checkers scramble to hold on to decaying institutions; the cautious but electric rush of energy when dictatorial edifices designed to stifle innovation, enterprise, and thought are exposed or toppled.Fundamentally, the Vibe Shift is a return to—a championing of—Reality, a rejection of the bureaucratic, the cowardly, the guilt-driven; a return to greatness, courage, and joyous ambition.”

We truly want to believe this is true. And this much is certainly correct: the battle lines are incredibly clear these days. The media that uncritically echo the deep-state line are known: Slate, Wired, Rolling Stone, Mother Jones, New Republic, New Yorker, and so on, to say nothing of the New York Times. What used to be politically partisan venues with certain predictable biases are now more readily described as ruling-class mouthpieces, forever instructing you precisely how to think while demonizing disagreement.

After all, all of these venues, in addition to the obvious case of the science journals, are still defending the lockdowns and everything that followed. Rather than express regret for their bad models and immoral means of control, they have continued to insist that they did the right thing, regardless of the civilization-wide carnage everywhere in evidence, while ignoring the relationship between the policies they championed and the terrible results.

Instead of allowing their mistakes to change their own outlook, they have adapted their own worldview to allow for snap lockdowns anytime they deem them necessary. In holding this view, they have forged a view of politics that it is embarrassingly acquiescent to the powerful.

The liberalism that once questioned authority and demanded free speech seems extinct.This transmogrified and captured liberalism now demands compliance with authority and calls for further restrictions on free speech. Now anyone who makes a basic demand for normal freedom—to speak or choose one’s own medical treatment or to decline to wear a mask—can reliably anticipate being denounced as “right-wing” even when it makes absolutely no sense.

The smears, cancellations, and denunciations are out of control, and so unbearably predictable.

It’s enough to make one’s head spin. As for the pandemic protocols themselves, there have been no apologies but only more insistence that they were imposed with the best of intentions and mostly correct. The World Health Organization wants more power, and so does the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even though the evidence of the failure of pharma pours in daily, major media venues pretend that all is well, and thereby out themselves as mouthpieces for the ruling regime.

The issue is that major and unbearably obvious failures have never been admitted. Institutions and individuals who only double down on preposterous lies that everyone knows are lies only end up discrediting themselves.

That’s a pretty good summary of where we are today, with vast swaths of elite culture facing an unprecedented loss of trust.Elites have chosen the lie over truth and cover-up over transparency.

This is becoming operationalized in declining traffic for legacy media, which is shedding costly staff as fast as possible. The social media venues that cooperated closely with government during the lockdowns are losing cultural sway while uncensored ones like Elon Musk’s X are gaining attention. Disney is reeling from its partisanship, while states are passing new laws against WHO policies and interventions.

Sometimes this whole revolt can be quite entertaining.

When the CDC or WHO posts an update on X, when they allow comments, it is followed by thousands of reader comments of denunciation and poking fun, with flurries of comments to the effect of “I will not comply.”

DEI is being systematically defunded by major corporations while financial institutions are turning on it.Indeed, the culture in general has come to regard DEI as a sure indication of incompetence. Meanwhile, the outer reaches of the “great reset” such as the hope that EVs would replace internal combustion have come to naught as the EV market has collapsed, along with consumer demand for fake meat to say nothing of bug eating.

As for politics, yes, it does seem like the backlash has empowered populist movements all over the world. We see them in the farmers’ revolt in Europe, the street protests in Brazil against a sketchy election, the widespread discontent in Canada over government policies, and even in migration trends out of US blue states toward red ones. Already, the administrative state in D.C. is working to secure itself against a possible unfriendly president in the form of Donald Trump or RFK, Jr.

So, yes, there are many signs of revolt. These are all very encouraging.

What does all this mean in practice? How does this end? How precisely does a revolt take shape in an industrialized democracy? What is the mostly likely pathway for long-term social change?

These are legitimate questions.

For hundreds of years, our best political philosophers have opined that no system can function in a sustainable way in which a huge majority is coercively governed by a tiny elite with a class interest in serving themselves at public expense.

That seems correct. In the days of the Occupy Wall Street movement of 15 years ago, the street protesters spoke of the 1 percent vs. the 99 percent. They were speaking of those with the money inside the traders’ buildings as opposed to the people on the streets and everywhere else.

Even if that movement misidentified the full nature of the problem, the intuition into which it tapped spoke to a truth.Such a disproportionate distribution of power and wealth is dangerously unsustainable. Revolution of some sort threatens.The mystery right now is what form this takes. It’s unknown because we’ve never been here before.

There is no real historical record of a highly developed society ostensibly living under a civilized code of law that experiences an upheaval of the type that would be required to unseat the rulers of all the commanding heights. We’ve seen political reform movements that take place from the top down but not really anything that approximates a genuine bottom-up revolution of the sort that is shaping up right now.

We know, or think we know, how it all transpires in a tinpot dictatorship or a socialist society of the old Soviet bloc.The government loses all legitimacy, the military flips loyalties, there is a popular revolt that boils over, and the leaders of the government flee. Or they simply lose their jobs and take up new positions in civilian life. These revolutions can be violent or peaceful but the end result is the same. One regime replaces another.

It’s hard to know how this translates to a society that is heavily modernized and seen as non-totalitarian and even existing under the rule of law, more or less.How does revolution occur in this case? How does the regime come around to adapting itself to a public revolt against governance as we know it in the US, UK, and Europe?

Yes, there is the vote, if we can trust that.But even here, there are the candidates, which are that for a reason. They specialize in politics, which does not necessarily mean doing the right thing or reflecting the aspirations of the voters behind them. They are responsive to their donors first, as we have long discovered. Public opinion can matter but there is no mechanism that guarantees a smoothly responsive pathway from popular attitudes to political outcomes.

There is also the pathway of industrial change, a migration of resources out of legacy venues to new ones. Indeed, in the marketplace of ideas, the amplifiers of regime propaganda are failing but we also observe the response: widened censorship. What’s happening in Brazil with the full criminalization of free speech can easily happen in the US.

In social media, were it not for Elon’s takeover of Twitter, it’s hard to know where we would be.We have no large platform in which to influence the culture more broadly. And yet the attacks on that platform and other enterprises owned by Musk are growing. This is emblematic of a much more robust upheaval taking place, one that suggests change is on the way.

But how long does such a paradigm shift take? Thomas Kuhn’s “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions” is a bracing account of how one orthodoxy migrates to another not by the ebb and flow of proof and evidence but through dramatic paradigm shifts. An abundance of anomalies can wholly discredit a current praxis but that doesn’t make it go away. Ego and institutional inertia perpetuate the problem until its most prominent exponents retire and die and a new elite replaces them with different ideas.

In this model, we can expect that a failed innovation in science, politics, or technology could last as long as 70 years before finally being displaced, which is roughly how long the Soviet experiment lasted. That’s a depressing thought. If this is true, we still have another 60 plus years of rule by the management professionals who enacted lockdowns, closures, shot mandates, population propaganda, and censorship.

And yet, people say that history is moving faster now than in the past. If a future of freedom is ours just lying in wait, we need that future here sooner rather than later, before it is too late to do anything about it.

The slogan became popular about ten years ago: the revolution will be decentralized with the creation of robust parallel institutions. There is no other path.

The intellectual parlor game is over. This is a real-life struggle for freedom itself. It’s resist and rebuild or doom.

2024-04-12 22:00:00,Google Begins Blocking News From California Outlets Over State Bill,https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/google-begins-blocking-news-california-outlets-over-state-bill,"Google has temporarily blocked access to California-based news outlets for some state residents, as the search giant escalates its battle with the state over a landmark bill which would force tech giants to pay online publishers for their content.

In doing so, the company has revived a political tactic used repeatedly by the tech industry to try and derail similar legislation in places like Canada and Australia which require online platforms to pay outlets for articles featured on their websites,Politicoreports.

""We have long said that this is the wrong approach to supporting journalism,"" said Google's VP for global news partnership, Jaffer Zaidi, in a Friday blog post. According to Zaidi, the bill could ""result in significant changes to the services we can offer Californians and the traffic we can provide to California publishers.""

Sacramento is hosting the latest round of a global fight over the journalism industry’s future in the digital age, andCalifornia’s battle has taken on additional resonance because the state is home to tech titans. Advocates for such legislation argue companies like Google and Meta have helped decimate already flagging newsroom revenues through their control over digital advertising, and outlets deserve compensation for content that users may see on their platforms for free.

The companies counter that these laws could stifle vital sources of information— and they’ve fought back by attempting to preview what they say that would look like. -Politico

In Canada, Google similarly threatened to block content before reaching adealwith the government last November, three weeks before the 'Online News Act' came into effect. The company agreed to makeannual payments to news outletsin the range of $100 million.

Meta,meanwhile, has completely removed news content from its social feed in Canada, and hasthreatened to do the samein California - where the company has lobbied heavily against the measures currently under consideration in the state legislature.The company has spent over $1 million to run an ad campaign decrying the bill as a ""link tax,""a phrase Zaidi used in his blog post.

According to state Sen. Ben Allen (D), ""Newspaper publishers and the journalists provide a really important service as a part of [Google’s] broader business model, and meanwhilethey’re going bankrupt and you guys have record profits.""

2024-04-12 22:20:00,Can The US And Iraq Move Beyond Military Ties?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/can-us-and-iraq-move-beyond-military-ties#comment-stream,"Authored by James Durso via ResponsibleStatecraft.org,

Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani is in Washington next week with both sides hoping to expand their economic relationship...

Twenty-one years ago, the U.S. and its allies invaded Iraq in the erroneous belief that the country possessed weapons of mass destruction and was allied with al-Qaida, the terror group responsible for the 9/11 attacks.

The U.S. created an occupation authority, but failed to restore order and helped spawn the insurgency that bedeviled it by dismissing the entire Iraqi military and the most experienced civil servants. Coalition troops fought a losing battle, regained their footing with the 2007 troop surge, and finally departed in 2011. U.S. troops returned in 2014 to fight the Islamic State and they remain there to this day, though ISIS was largely eliminated by 2019.

In January 2020,Iraq’s parliamentvoted on a nonbinding measure to remove the U.S. troops from Iraq, but the Americans remain at the request of the Iraqi government.However, in response to the parliament’s 2020 vote, Iraq and the International Coalition changed the mission of the troops from a combat mission to one of advisory and training.

Iraq’s prime minister, Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani, will meet U.S. President Joe Biden on April 15, primarily to discuss the U.S. troop presence.

Though the U.S.-IraqHigher Military Commissionis reviewing the troop presence issue, will the U.S. side stall fearing it may have to agree to a smaller presence and constrained operations?

Possibly, so Sudani may want a public commitment from Biden to force the march to a constructive, timely decision.

Aside from the troops issue, Sudani wants to strengthen Baghdad’s ties with Washington, which he considers Iraq’s top bilateral relationship, and to add an economic dimension to Iraq’s ties with America.

When Americans think of Iraq in economic terms it’s all about the oil, but in November 2023ExxonMobil, America’s biggest oil company, exited Iraq with nothing to show for a decade-long effort.

The departure will lower the expectation of other U.S. companies, but Sudani wants to revitalize economic ties, and he will be accompanied by many of the country’s top businessmen.

In 2022, the U.S. exported $897 million in goods, the top product being automobiles. Iraq, in turn, exported $10.3 billion in goods, most of it crude oil.

A key economic objective of Iraq is the $17 billionDevelopment Road, an overland road and rail link from the Persian Gulf to Europe via Turkey, that will host free-trade zones along its length.

Biden and Sudani should consider the shape of the future U.S.-Iraq relationship, which has to now been governed by military considerations, and has become the best example ofThe Meddler’s Trap, “a situation of self-entanglement, whereby a leader inadvertently creates a problem through military intervention, feels they can solve it, and values solving the new problem more because of the initial intervention. …A military intervention causes a feeling of ownership of the foreign territory, triggering the endowment effect.”

Iraq is the only real democracy in the Arab world, and manyyoung Iraqiswant a separation of religion and state, something that should resonate with Americans and, Iraqis hope, cause the U.S. to deal with Iraq as Iraq, not a platform for operations against Syria and Iran, or to support Washington’s Kurdish clients.

Washington damaged itself in Iraq by killing Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in January 2020. Baghdad had moved the PMF, once a militia, into the government in 2016 (no doubt with American encouragement), so the killing of Muhandis, then a government official, increased popular support the PMF.

Corruption. Pervasive corruption in Iraq has slowed economic development and subjected Iraqi citizens to ineffective governance. The2023Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International ranked Iraq 154 of 180, a slight improvement from2022when it ranked 157 of 180.

Iraq was previously described by TI as:“Among the worst countries on corruption and governance indicators, with corruption risks exacerbated by lack of experience in the public administration, weak capacity to absorb the influx of aid money, sectarian issues and lack of political will for anti-corruption efforts.”

Sudani has not ignoredcorruption, calling it one of the country’s greatest challenges and “no less serious than the threat of terrorism.”

Elizabeth Tsurkov. Tsurkov is a Russian-Israeli academic who waskidnappedin 2023 by Kata’ib Hezbollah, an Iranian-influenced Iraqi militia. Tsurkov, a doctoral student at Princeton University in the U.S., entered Iraq with her Russian passport and did not disclose that she was an Israeli citizen and Israeli Defense Forces veteran. (A 2022 Iraqi lawcriminalizedany relations with Israel.)

Tsurkov’s family wants the Biden administration to designateIraqa state sponsor of terrorism for failing to secure her release. Sudani’s office announced an investigation into the matter and the issue may arise when Sudani meets Biden, though the best outcome for Iraq and the U.S. is a Russia-brokered deal between Israel and Iran.

If Biden designates Iraq a state sponsor of terrorism that will irreparably damage the relationship and open the door for China.

China. The U.S. is Iraq’s top relationship, but not its only relationship. China will respond to the ostracism of Baghdad by extending invitations to theShanghai Cooperation OrganizationandBRICS, the latter of which can fund infrastructure projects through theNew Development Bank. PetroChina replaced ExxonMobil in West Qurna 1, one of Iraq’s biggest oil fields, and is ideally positioned for further expansion. AndIraqwas the “leading beneficiary” of China’s Belt and Road Initiative investment in 2021.

Sudani has said Iraq should not be a cockpit of conflict for the U.S. and Iran, but when Iran is concerned it, in Washington, is always 1979.

Though Sudani has many challenges to face, Biden has more:he must reorient his government away from its colonial mentality in West Asia, recognize that Baghdad must reach a modus vivendi with Tehran that may not be to Washington’s pleasure, and not smooth the way for Beijing’s greater penetration of West Asia.

2024-04-12 22:40:00,Harvard To Once Again Require SATs For Admissions,https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/harvard-once-again-require-sat-admissions,"Harvard is joining the ranks of other universities in recognizing the obvious: SATs are a great way to measure aptitude. And now that Harvard is busy grappling withotherissues like plagiarism among its top ranks, it has decided to quietly shuffle SAT requirements back to where they were pre-Covid.

Harvard will reintroduce standardized testing requirements for admissions starting with the Class of 2029, deviating from its prior commitment to remain test-optional through the Class of 2030.

This change, prompted by criticism as peers like Yale, Dartmouth, and Brown resumed mandatory testing, will affect applicants for fall and winter 2024, who must submit SAT or ACT scores unless exceptions apply. In specific cases where students can't access these tests, Harvard will accept scores from Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate exams instead, according tothe Harvard Crimson.

Complete and utter defeat for the anti-test crusaderspic.twitter.com/ubfbg2QTxL

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Hopi E. Hoekstra said:“...standardized tests are a means for all students, regardless of their background and life experience, to provide information that is predictive of success in college and beyond. More information, especially such strongly predictive information, is valuable for identifying talent from across the socioeconomic range. With this change, we hope to strengthen our ability to identify these promising students.”

Uh, yeah.That's why it was a requirement to begin with. But we digress...

The Crimsonwrotethat despite a majority of undergraduates submitting standardized test scores over the past four years, the exact figure has not been disclosed.

Recently, Harvard officials, including Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons, were non-committal about reinstating testing requirements, noting ongoing policy reviews. However, a study from the Harvard-affiliated Opportunity Insights indicated that SAT scores are a better predictor of college success than high school GPA. Experts also suggest that requiring standardized tests could enhance racial and socioeconomic diversity at universities like Harvard.

Harvard economist David J. Deming commented that test scores provide the “fairest admissions policy for disadvantaged applicants.”

“Not everyone can hire an expensive college coach to help them craft a personal essay. But everyone has the chance to ace the SAT or the ACT,” he continued.

Recall,we wrote just days agothat $500 tutors were back en vogue now that SATs were being reinstated. It was earlier this year whenwe notedthat SATs were once again being reconsidered by colleges who had reduced or eliminated their requirement due to (pick one: diversity, racism, climate change, equity, gender affirmation).

As a result of the comeback, Bloomberg noted that tutors, sometimes costing $500 per hour, are all of a sudden back in vogue. They wrote that demand for SAT tutoring and prep centers is surgingas several top colleges reintroduce mandatory SATs, and students adapt to the SAT's new digital format.

Kaplan reported a significant enrollment increase, attributed to digital testing and the reinstatement of testing requirements by institutions and three Ivy League schools—Yale, Dartmouth, and Brown—have reinstated mandatory SATs, alongside MIT and the University of Texas at Austin. This shift has left many students scrambling for preparation before early application deadlines.

Companies like The Princeton Review have also seen a spike in interest for prep services.

Wenoted earlier this yearin a piece from American Greatness, that according toAxios, multiple colleges used the Chinese Coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to weaken the importance of SAT and ACT test scores in most student applications. But in recent weeks, several schools have reversed course; Yale is considering repealing its prior policy of making SAT/ACT requirements optional, with Dartmouth already reinstating the requirements earlier this month. MIT reversed a similar policy back in 2022.

2024-04-12 23:20:00,BJP Dominates Election Polls But Loses Southern India,https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/bjp-dominates-election-polls-loses-southern-india,"According to an opinion poll carried out in Marchin all of India's 543 constituencies by India TV and CNX,Narendra Modi's BJP and its allies are projected to win almost three quarters or 399 seats in India's lower houseLok Sabha in this year's national election which starts on April 19.Right now, the party's National Democratic Alliance has 346 seats in the assembly, or 64 percent.

As Statista's Katharina Buchholz reports,a landslide victory of the BJP had been predicted previously.

However, due to the loss of strategic allies and the party's general weakness in the region,Modi's results look less than perfect in India's South, where constituents continue to vote for opposition partieslike the Indian National Congress and its allies of the I.N.D.I.A. coalition.

You will find more infographics atStatista

Bloomberg Opinion pointsout that while the rejection of Modi in the South won't matter this time around as the current prime minister has captured much of the populous North and Center, many of India's progressive cities and regions are in this part of the country.Southern constituents are important for the country as a whole due to the region's strong industries and flourishing economy but currently lack a sufficient voice in national politics, which has already led to friction with India's leaders.

In Tamil Nadu, popular voting choices include Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the socialist leading party expected to win 18 seats (46 percent). Congress itself is projected to take another eight seats (21 percent) in the state, while unaffiliated All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which disassociated from the BJP last year, could win four (10 percent). In neighboring Kerala, the mostly-Congress aligned United Democratic Front (UDF) is expected to take 10 seats (50 percent) while another seven (35 percent) could fall to the communist-dominated Left Democratic Front (LDF), which has ruled the state legislature since 2016. In Telangana, Congress' voting intentions would amount up to nine seats (53 percent).

Other Southern states where the BJP is expected to fare worse than in India overall are Odisha and Andrah Pradesh.Here, more unaligned parties are expected to win big, including Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the ruling Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) in Andrah Pradesh as well as Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in Odisha, where it also heads the state legislature. States in other regions where the BJP has a weaker showing are Punjab, where the Aam Aadmi Party is expected to win six seats (46 percent) and West Bengal, home to the newly unaligned All India Trinamool Congress, expected to take 19 or 45 percent of seats.

2024-04-12 23:40:00,The Political Left Has Proven Beyond A Doubt That They Are Authoritarians,https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/political-left-has-proven-beyond-doubt-they-are-authoritarians#comment-stream,"Authored by Brandon Smith via Alt-Market.us,

Nearly 20 years ago when I started my work in the independent media the common mantra among my peers was noting the existence of the“false left/right paradigm” – The idea that Democrats and Republicans were essentially the same and were working towards the same exact authoritarian goals.This was before the Ron Paul movement and the libertarian/patriot shift within conservative circles when Neocons (fake conservatives) dominated all Republican discourse.

In the 16 years since there has been some interesting developments at the state level, with a return to true conservative and constitutional principles.Conservative ideals were on the verge of death in the early 2000s, but thanks to Ron Paul and others there has been a resurgence.The false left/right paradigm still applies in many ways and we have to remain vigilant, but the most blatant RINO frauds are quickly losing favor.

Nihilists (and paid federal provocateurs) will constantly claim we aren’t making any progress, but consider this: Decades ago conservatives used to clamor to defend people like John McCain, Lindsay Graham or Mitt Romney, now they despise such fakes (McCain was hated by most conservatives well before he died). Times are changing; this is a fact, and we need to acknowledge the positive move forward.

This is not to say that Americans should rely on politics to fix our national problems, butit would be a lie to claim that there are no political representatives on our side.A common argument against right leaning movements is that conservative ideals are “poorly defined” and that we “don’t stand for anything.” This is simply not true.  In fact, it’s leftists that are constantly changing their positions like they have schizophrenia. Conservatives have been far more consistent in comparison.

The guidelines are relatively easy to understand – Conservatives and liberty activists support a return to constitutional governance, the protection of the Bill of Rights, free markets, meritocracy, the right to choose associations, truth in media, secure borders, the protection of children from exploitation, keeping America out of foreign entanglements, moral and accountable leadership, etc. The degree to which leaders can adhere to these parameters determines how much trust they earn, and trust is the only currency that matters these days.

Do we disagree on certain nuances of these issues? Of course. We aren’t like leftists following a central hive mind, always afraid of being canceled by the mob; we argue. That’s not necessarily a bad thing as long as we unify on basic tenets and principles.

Democrats (and leftists in general) on the other hand have gone in the complete opposite direction.If there was ever a time when the average leftist and conservative could find common ground, that time was LONG gone.Many leftists used to be pro-individual rights; today they argue incessantly against personal liberty as if it’s dangerous to society. They used to be anti-war; now they froth at the mouth over countries like Russia and press for WWIII without any rational thought. Their methods have become violent, vicious, egregious in execution as they adopt an “ends justify the means” approach.

The political left does not care about what is right. They do not care about what is true. They only care about “winning.”

It is this leftist infatuation with the dark side that is driving the US to the edge of civil war. Would a candidate like Trump be taken as seriously under normal political conditions? It’s hard to say – He wasn’t taken very seriously in 2012. However, when Democrats started to go full bore authoritarian suddenly Trump became very appealing to conservative voters.

Why? Because he represents a big middle finger to the communists, a bull in the china shop. If you want to piss off authoritarian Democrats trying to control what you say and what you think, you put Trump in their faces for another 4 years. Does this fix our underlying national problems? No, not in the slightest. In fact, I still believe Trump distracts patriots from what really needs to be done. I’m convinced that, at this stage, only war will resolve the issue. Voting for Trump is a good way to enrage the woke cry-bullies, and I wouldn’t fault anyone for wanting that, but any real return to honor and order would have to be implemented by the public, not the government.

The deeper problem is one of unavoidable cultural division – Conservatives and patriots cannot live side-by-side with rabid leftists, nor can we accept a leftist controlled government.They have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they intend to destroy every aspect of western culture and institute a regime of oppression.

So much has happened recently that I fear many Americans will become overwhelmed and forget the recent trespasses of leftists.  In case you had any doubts at all or know people that still defend them, here are just a handful of examples of the worst authoritarian crimes committed by Democrats in the past four years alone…

When Democrats talk about “equity” in criminal justice, what they are referring to is the unbalanced application of law depending on the ethnicity or political beliefs of the people being charged. The most blatant example being the kangaroo court for the Jan 6th event and their attempt to lock up conservative protesters as “insurrectionists.”

Not a single death occurred due to protesters, property damage was minimal and capitol police INCITED the riot by firing rubber bullets and CS gas into the otherwise peaceful crowd.Yet, the protesters were painted by Dems and the media as monsters trying to “destroy democracy.”

Compare this to the Democrat response to the BLM and Antifa riots across the US since 2016 in which dozens were killed, thousands of police injured, billions in property damage and multiple government buildings attacked.These people tried to hold the country hostage, yet, the vast majority of those that were actually arrested were released and never charged by Democrat District Attorneys and prosecutors. The media even portrayed them as heroes.

If Jan 6th had been a far-left protest, there would have been no commission and no one would be in jail for 10-20 years today. There are numerous examples of selective prosecution targeting patriots and the message is clear – “If you defy us in any way, we have no problem misusing the legal system to crush you.”

Did some Republicans initially support the covid lockdowns? Yes. When it became clear that covid was a non-threat did they end the lockdowns in their own states? Yes, surprisingly most of them did.

Half the states in the US (all red states) blocked attempts to continue the pandemic lockdowns.These same states also passed legislation to disrupt any future attempts at lockdowns or vaccine passports. And, all the governors and legislators involved were accused by Democrats and the media of “killing Americans” because of their defense of freedom.

In reality, these states along with conservatives across the country defeated a draconian agenda that almost brought the US to the brink of full spectrum medical tyranny.Democrats and globalists tried to use covid as an opportunity to institute sweeping anti-liberty mandates without checks and balances. Some ofrules they wanted to put in placeincluded:

No employment for the unvaccinated.

No access to public spaces for the unvaccinated.

No access to normal medical treatment for the unvaccinated.

House arrest for the unvaccinated.

Fines for the unvaccinated.

Jail time for people speaking against the mandates or vaccines.

Government tracking of the unvaccinated.

Taking children away from the unvaccinated.

Secret vaccination of children at public schools without knowledge of parents.

Mass online censorship of anyone presenting information contrary to the government narrative.

Some Democrats including Biden even threatened togo “door-to-door”to vaccinate individuals, though the official position was that they would instead seek to “make life so hard” for the unvaxxed that anyone in refusal would eventually be forced to comply.Luckily their plans failed.  The CDC published a bunch of unverified stats claiming most Americans were vaccinated, no one took the boosters and the agenda fizzled into the background.  That said, it’s important that we never forget what happened.

The true nature of the political left was exposed from 2020-2023, and the difference between conservatives and leftists was made undeniably clear – Red states were made free. Blue states tried to keep authoritarianism in place. Democrats embraced medical tyranny, conservatives did not. Conservatives left blue states (and blue cities) in droves because they were oppressive, red states gained millions of people and turned a deeper shade of red.  This is reality.

There’s no surer sign of authoritarianism than a group that recruits children as foot soldiers using political indoctrination under the noses of parents. Democrats and the woke movement have taken the mask off completely when it comes to America’s youth.

The widespread used of woke symbols such a pride flags in public schools and libraries. The use of drag queen performances (often sexual) as a means to normalize baseless gender fluid theories, mental illness and sexual aberration. State government funding of sexualized content including graphic lessons and books for young kids. The list goes on and on.

I can’t think of anything more insidious and evil as the leftist attempt to hijack American children as a weapon for their political coup. And make no mistake, the woke movement is not a movement for equality, it’s a communist and collectivist insurgency. They see children as tools, not as people.

Democrats are going so far as to pass laws allowing children to engage in sex change procedures including hormone blockers and surgerieswithout parental consent. This is a monstrous policy that needs to be snuffed out immediately. Children are not capable of consent.

Again, all this is being done in the name of winning. What is moral or ethical never crosses their minds.

Who nominated the Democrats to become the arbiters of acceptable speech? Well, they nominated themselves, and the protections of the 1st Amendment are being quietly degraded every day we allow them to continue acting as if they are the thought police.

The new term being thrown around in 2024 is “radical speech”, meaning any speech that runs contrary to “diversity, equity and inclusion” requirements, or any speech that contradicts the preeminence of the official narrative. Understand that “radical speech” is an arbitrary label; one has to consider what the legitimate consequences are and what the intent is.

For a Democrat, any speech that is detrimental to their goal of extorting public support for their policies suddenly becomes “radical.”The label is designed to elicit images of terrorism and fascism, as if mere words are magical and can compel the public to do great evil without them realizing it. This is childish fantasy based on projection. It’s leftists (collectivists) that believe words have magical powers, and so they put great emphasis on controlling speech in general.

I would partially agree, only in the fact that lies do have power to evoke emotional responses, but the only way to combat lies is with the truth. Anyone who says that the best way to combat lies is to use mass censorship is a liar. Democrats lean heavily on mass censorship, as we have seen with nearly every Big Tech social media platform and corporate news platform in the past few years.

The bottom line is this – When someone tells you exactly who they are, believe them.When a group of people show through a host of actions that they are authoritarians, they should not be allowed anywhere near power. It’s time to rethink our ongoing political relationship here in America and consider whether or not we should continue to live with a political movement that has made it so abundantly clear that they are hostile to freedom.

2024-04-13 06:00:00,Iran Readies Over 100 Cruise Missiles For Possible Strike Against Israel: US Officials,https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/us-restricts-diplomats-travel-israel-bracing-iran-attack-expected-weeks-end#comment-stream,"Update(1740):Multiple European airlines have canceled all flights to and from Iran, and flight trackers also indicate that skies above Israel are clear of civilian aviation.

Speculation is at a frenzy over the 'when & where' of the coming Iranian retaliation attack. ""Anonymous US officials"" have been feeding alarming headlines to media outlets all day - and among them the following:

Iran has readied a large number of missiles for a possible strike, according to three U.S. officials. Two of the officials said that Iran hasreadied more than 100 cruise missiles for a possible strike. Iran has also readied a sizeable number of drones that could be used in an attack on Israel, according to one official.

The officials said that Iran has been readying the missiles and drones over the last week.

The Pentagon has continued to move US naval assets closer to Israel, in apparent preparation to assist in repelling any potential attack.

Some have speculated that Hezbollah's stepped up attacks on northern Israel in the last hours aremeant as a prelude to bigger Iranian attack...

Update(1317ET):Israeli hospitals have been put on a high state of alert by the home command, awaiting an 'imminent' Iranian retaliation attack. Iran has also reportedly put the United States on notice...

Three U.S. Officials told Axios : Iran has sent a message to the U.S. through several Arab countries, thatif they interfere in Iran's response against Israel, U.S. bases in the region will be struck.

Meanwhile, Russia just chose quite the wrong moment to conduct a test-firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile from its Kapustin Yar airbase in southern Russia. The rocket was reportedly seen soaring high in the atmosphere from parts of northern Iraq and Iran, triggering concerns it was Iran beginning its attack.

Below are some breaking headlines:

Some additional reports that this may have been a Russian launch.https://t.co/rjqGWxh7RJ

Hezbollah appears to have ramped up its missile salvos over northern Israel:

There are also new reports that the US Navy has parked an advanced missile ship just off Israel's coast, readying to assist with a possible response.

Channel 14 in Israel is reporting that an “Advanced Missile Ship” with the U.S. Navy, likely an Arleigh Burke-Class Guided-Missile Destroyer, has arrived off the Coast of Israel to assist with the Interception of Missiles and Drones launched by Iranian and/or Iranian-Backed Proxy…pic.twitter.com/hDuxYDEY3T

Update(1116ET): At a moment US intelligence has indicated that Iran could strike Israeli soil in the next 24 to 48 hours, a top US general was spotted at an airbase in central Israel on Friday. US Central Command (CENTCOM) chief Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla met with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant at Hatzor Airbase""a short while ago,""according toTimes of Israelmilitary correspondent Emanuel Fabian.

The two defense officials discussed ""readiness for an Iranian attack against the State of Israel, which may lead to regional escalation,"" an official statement of the visit by Gallant's said. Given it could be ""bombs away"" at any moment, is it a good idea for America's top regional general to be hanging out at one of the very bases which could be directly targeted?

""Our enemies think that they can pull apart Israel and the United States, but the opposite is true, they are bringing us together and strengthening our ties. We stand shoulder to shoulder,"" Gallant's statement continued.

""I am certain that the world sees the true face of Iran, the terrorist body that incites terror attacks across the Middle East, and funds Hamas, Hezbollah, and additional forces [proxies], and now also threatens the State of Israel,"" the Israeli defense chief added. ""We are prepared to defend ourselves on the ground and in the air, in close cooperation with our partners, and we will know how to respond.""

It goes without saying that if top US military officials are currently on the ground and find themselves in the attack path when Iranian missiles are launched, it could be a direct trigger for massive regional war, given Washington wouldn't hesitate to respond in a big way against Tehran in that scenario.

Barring some last minute development Iran is going to attack#Israel. The response and risk of escalation will depend on what and how they attack.

Iran is expected to attack Israel by week's end, or at least within the coming days. However, the degree of telegraphing has almost taken the teeth out of the threat and what Iran hopes to accomplish in its retaliation.

""Iran is calibrating its plans for a major retaliatory strike against Israelto send a message—but not spark a regional war that compels Washington to respond, the U.S. assesses,""Politicoreportsof what's expected. ""Biden administration officials judge that Iran is planninga larger-than-usual aerial attackon Israel in the coming days, one that will likely feature a mix of missiles and drone strikes, said two U.S. officials who were granted anonymity to detail sensitive intelligence assessments.""

The Pentagon has apparentlymoved naval assets closer to Israelin expectation of Iranian strikes (or else major attacks from their proxies like Hezbollah or the Houthis), including the USS Eisenhower aircraft carrier which is patrolling the Red Sea. Israel's Channel 14 also reports, ""The US military deployed a missile ship with advanced defense capabilities near the shores of Israel.""

The US has said it is ready to coordinate a response with Israel if it is hit; however, the defense consensus is that Iran is unlikely to send missiles and drones directly from its soil. CBS has newly cited two US officials who say that ""a major Iranian attack against Israel was expected as soon as Friday,possibly to include more than 100 drones and dozens of missiles aimed at military targets inside the country.""

But so far the past days have been a constant avalanche of speculation as an attack remains 'imminent'. The US State Department is taking action, issuing a security warning to all government employees and their families for the US Embassy in Jerusalem.Travel restrictions have been placed on their movements, after the embassy has been on edge ever since Israel's unprecedented April 1st attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.

""Out of an abundance of caution, U.S. government employees and their family members are restricted from personal travel outside the greater Tel Aviv, … Jerusalem, and Be’er Sheva areas until further notice,” US Embassysecurity alert, issued Thursday says.

""The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem reminds U.S. citizens of the continued need for caution and increased personal security awareness as security incidents often take place without warning,"" the alert continued. ""The security environment remains complex and can change quickly depending on the political situation and recent events.""

Several other countries have issued travel warnings to their citizens, while bracing for a possible bigger war in the Middle East, including Russia and India of late. The UK and France have reportedly called on their citizens to leave immediately, citing an inevitable attack from Iran.

⚡️BREAKINGThe US is bringing the aircraft carrier Eisenhower closer to Israel, probably in an attempt to intercept the Iranian missiles, since the US does not want to put its military bases at risk if it intercepts them from therepic.twitter.com/Qn1uS80Bf1

Meanwhile the speculation continues as to the timing, withThe Wall Street Journalon Fridayreportingthat ""Israel is preparing for a direct attack from Iran on southern or northern Israelas soon as Friday or Saturday, according to a person familiar with the matter.""

However, even US intelligence doesn't have a crystal ball. The WSJ follows with this caveat: ""A person briefed by the Iranian leadership, however, said that while plans to attack are being discussed, no final decision has been made.""

Starting Thursday, Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), arrived in Israel amid reports that the US and Israelcould respond jointlyto any imminent Iranian attack on Israel. Alarmingly,Ynetreports Friday that ""The IDF and Mossad approved plans for an attack on Iran in the event that Israel would come under attack from Iranian territory. Additionally, the coordination between the U.S. and Israeli militaries, has increased.""

2024-04-13 07:00:00,"Macron First Threatens Russia With Troops, Then Buys €600 Million Of Gas From Moscow In Q1 2024",https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/macron-first-threatens-russia-troops-then-buys-eu600-million-gas-moscow-q1-2024,"Authored by John Cody via ReMix News,

At the same time that French President Emmanuel Macron is threatening to send troops to Ukraine to fight against Russia, his country is fueling the Russian war effort by purchasing €600 million worth of natural gas from Moscow in the first three months of 2024.

According to new data, France is quietly paying more and more for Russian gas, even as France uses increasingly harsh rhetoric towards Russia.

In fact, the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) think tank indicates thatRussian liquefied natural gas shipments saw a bigger increase in France than any other EU country last year.The €600 million France paid will undoubtedly help fuel Russia’s war effort in Ukraine.

Last month, Macron said France could not rule out sending troops to Ukraine, with the announcement sparking fierce debate across Europe.

Macron went so far as to call on fellow NATO allies to not be “cowards.”

Many European leaders reacted harshly to Macron’s statements, including several nations stating plainly they would not send any of their own troops to participate in the conflict.

France has continuously tried to justify its gas and oil purchases from Russia by arguing that it is locked into long-term contracts with Russia that are difficult to cancel.

Critics say that Macron could be doing more to reduce France’s reliance on natural gas from Russia, especially when he is claiming that France is one of Ukraine’s greatest allies.

Energy continues to be a bedrock for Russia’s revenue stream, with fossil fuels contributing up to half of its revenue streams.

Despite France and other EU countries continuing to actively purchase Russian oil and gas, as well as nuclear fuel, the EU’s efforts to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy have been largely successful, with the bloc reducing its consumption by two-thirds. However, there are questions about how accurate these purported figures actually are, as Europe has, for instance, drastically increased its purchases of natural gas and oil from India. In reality, much of these energy products come from Russia, with India simply serving as a middleman and skimming extra profit off the sales.

Europe continues to spend billions on Russian liquified natural gas (LNG), and for the foreseeable future, that is unlikely to change.

France is hardly the only country purchasing Russian energy, but Macron and many of the other Western leaders using hawkish rhetoric towards Russia are perhaps the biggest hypocrites. At least nine EU countries continue to buy Russian LNG, according to shipping data. France leads these countries in terms of overall quantities of purchases in 2024, while Belgium, Spain, and the Netherlands all follow behind.

French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire has defended Paris’ massive purchases, saying that ending France’s dependence on gas from Moscow must be “gradually implemented to avoid too brutal an impact on the market” and price increases.

Recently, claims have been circulating that some right-wing politicians accepted money from the news outlet Voice of Europe, which was reportedly funded by Russia. The news caused widespread outrage from the liberal media, while, at the same time, some of the most left-liberal countries in all of Europe continue to send billions to Russia.

2024-04-13 07:00:22,Middle East Crisis: Container Ship Hijacked Near Strait Of Hormuz Amid Soaring Iran Tensions,https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/middle-east-crisis-container-ship-hijacked-near-strait-hormuz-amid-soaring-iran,"While Israel on Friday braced forcruise missile and suicide drone attacks, there are new reports on Saturday morning that Iranian commandos hijacked an Israeli-affiliated container ship heading towards the Strait of Hormuz.

AP Newssays the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations initially reported the hijacking of Portuguese-flagged MSC Aries, a container ship linked to London-based Zodiac Maritime. Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer controls the international ship management company that owns and charters large vessels.

Video of the boarding has been circulating X for the past hour. However, ""AP could not immediately verify the video, it corresponded to known details of the boarding, and the helicopter involved appeared to be one used by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which has carried out other ship raids in the past,"" the media outlet said.

#NEW: Video of the hijacking of the MSC Aries by the IRGCpic.twitter.com/AlANlpbAYM

According to Bloomberg data, MSC Aries was leaving a port from Dubai on Thursday and heading towards the Strait of Hormuz. The vessel's last known position was recorded around 1256 local time on Friday off Dubai's coast. AP noted that the ship's transponder had been switched off.

X user Megatroncalled the ship's seizure by Iran a ""big game changer"":

This once again is confirming that the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Qatar are helping Israel bypass the Houthi blockade by land route from the UAE port.

Iran is now cutting that route as well.

If Hezbollah cut the Mediterranean route with its drones, Israel could fall into a complete trade blockade.

🇮🇷🇮🇱 Iran seized the Israeli ship MSC ARIES in the Strait of Hormuz.This is a big game changer.This once again is confirming that the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Qatar are helping Israel bypass the Houthi blockade by land route from the UAE port.Iran is now cutting…pic.twitter.com/D47J0jbvRU

The incident in the Strait of Hormuz is very concerning since maritime chokepoints in the region are plagued with conflict. Off of Yemen, in the Bab-El Mandeb Strait, Iran-backed Houthis have unleashed multi-month drone and missile attacks against US, UK, and Israeli vessels.

In a recent note to clients, the global corporate & investment banking capital markets strategy team at MUFG Bank warned the key theme for 2024 would be ""Higher friction geopolitics.""

Focusing on the Middle East, MUFG's Tom Joyce showed how 25% of global trade flows through three chokepoints: Suez Canal, Bab-El Mandeb Strait, and Strait of Hormuz. The latest incident is very concerning for global trade and flow of goods, such as energy products, through the region.

This all comes as Israel is bracing for drone and missile attacks by Iran or its proxies as warnings flashed on Friday about retaliation for the killing last week of seniorIranian military officials at the country's embassy in Damascus.

2024-04-13 08:10:00,Zelensky Is Lying About An Upcoming Counteroffensive Out Of Desperation To Receive More Aid,https://web.archive.org/web/20240413121026/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/zelensky-lying-about-upcoming-counteroffensive-out-desperation-receive-more-aid#comment-stream,"Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

Zelensky told German media in an interview earlier this week that Ukraine isplanning another counteroffensiveagainst Russia, which is why it requires production licenses from its partners in order to build up its domestic military-industrial capacity ahead of that event.He also urged the US to break itsCongressional deadlockon Ukraine aid in order to help his country prepare for this next campaign. No counteroffensive is actually planned, however, since Ukraine completely lacks the manpower and arms.

It can’t realistically narrow the yawning gap between itself and Russia, which was only widened since thedramatic failure of last summer’s counteroffensive.Russia already won the “race of logistics”/“war of attrition” with NATO by far, which has dawned on many in the West over the past nine months, hence the renewed interest among some from that bloc forfreezing the conflict. Nevertheless, policymakers still want to perpetuate theNATO-Russianproxy war, which his why peace talks have yet to resume.

That approach is increasingly unpopular with the masses,who’ve grown fatigued and frustrated with this conflict, especially after last summer’s failed counteroffensive exposed the fallacy of their hopes to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia. This is particularly the case with the Ukrainians themselves, many of whom know someone who was killed or maimed in one of the meatgrinders. Left unaddressed, these public opinion trends could greatly complicate policymakers’ plans for perpetuating the conflict.

Therein lies the significance of Zelensky’s lie about an upcoming counteroffensive, which aims to advance several objectives,first and foremost misleading his own people by making them think that his regime has a plan for ending the conflict on their terms. They’re unlikely to fall for that though after seeing with their own eyes and hearing from trusted sources how bad everything is going for Ukraine.

Even so, Zelensky is so out of touch with his people that he still thinks he can mislead them about this.

The second objective is to deceive the foreign public in order to help relieve some of the pressure upon his Western patrons’ policymakerswhose people are nowadays demanding that their politicians devise an exit plan for extricating their countries from what they’ve come to believe is a stalemate. They consider Zelensky to be very ungrateful for all the assistance that he’s hitherto received on the taxpayers’ dime and can’t imagine that anything more could make a military-strategic difference at this point.

These two perception management objectives lead to the third one regarding Zelensky’s desperate need to receive as much aid as he can as soon as possible by deceiving everyone about his side’s plans before Russia achieves a military breakthrough across the front lines.

TheUkrainian Intelligence Committeewarned in late February that this could happen by as early as the summer, which they also predicted could coincide with nationwide protests that bring an end to his regime.

There’s no chance that Ukraine can muster the men and arms required for carrying out another counteroffensive before then, let alone after Russia’s reportedly forthcoming offensive ends(if his regime isn’t overthrown by then, that is), but there’s a chance that it could survive the onslaught. The only way to improve its odds is to deceive Ukrainians with false hopes about an upcoming counteroffensive so that they don’t protest while deceiving foreigners into supporting more aid.

In other words,the survival of Zelensky’s regime is on the line for the first time since Russia’s “goodwill” gesture of withdrawing its forces from Kiev during spring 2022’s peace talks,which it did out of the naïve belief that this was required toseal the dealfor swiftly ending the special operation. He’s scared but he can’t show it and is therefore harnessing all of his acting skills to present a false veneer of confidence.If the front lines don’t hold and more aid isn’t forthcoming, then he might be out of power by year’s end.

Good morning readers,

Yields tumbled to end the week in a last-minute flight to safety trade on Friday. Tensions in the Middle East stirred markets and drove capital into US Treasuries and gold despite an afternoon smackdown in the yellow metal, the two largest safe-haven assets in global capital markets. Twos and 10s both fell 6 basis points to close Friday. On the week though, 2s rose 14 basis points this week and 10s rose 12 basis points. Though Friday ended on a fearful note, Treasury yields are still very much gunning for cycle highs. Risk-off impulse is not fully here yet:

Gold also had plenty of action this week as safe-haven demand rose for the tried and true wartime asset. Gold rose as high as $2,430 on Friday before slipping and ending the day 1.5% lower. This year, gold has managed to rise almost 15%, finally breaking above the $2,100 ceiling that has constrained it since mid-2020:

The massive correlation break between gold and real rates continues to get worse. Gold is ripping higher while real rates also rise, breaking their historical inverse relationship. Both of these assets have historically reflected inflation. Since the massive boom of monetary and fiscal stimulus in 2021, the two assets have been dislocated from each other, and now the two look like they were never inversely correlated in the first place. Now as gold rises, real rates are rising too.

In all likelihood, the inflation calculation included in real yields is so off the mark now that real yields have lost the ability to accurately reflect real inflation. Ostensibly, this chart tells us that CPI is so cooked that gold is one of the only assets that still accurately reflects inflation. Price inflation is much higher than the officially reported 3.5% figure taken from CPI, and gold is simply one of the last real fire alarms:

Elevated yields have also pummeled equity risk premiums, with the S&P 500’s premium over the 10-year US Treasury yield sitting at a 25-year low of just 17 basis points. In the last quarter century, owning stocks has never been less attractive:

The same war jitters that have helped gold have hurt risk. VIX, stock market volatility that acts as a fear barometer, spiked to its highest levels of the year today. The stock market has massively diverged from bank reserves over the last 16 months, with the market cap of the US stock market appreciating far and away from the level of bank reserves in the financial system—we are not implying causation but continually appreciate the historic correlation of QE/QT and stock prices. At long last, stocks are on the move back down, potentially converging once again with the level of bank reserves. For now, the bull market remains intact, but we’ll keep our eye on this relationship:

Inflows to the 9 new bitcoin ETFs, excluding GBTC, totaled $572 million this week, the lowest week to date. The jitters felt all across risk this week were felt particularly strongly in bitcoin, and the muted/negative action in bitcoin ETFs is no exception. Investor behavior is the same so far between bitcoin and its spot ETFs:

Bitcoin’s consolidation continues for the 6th-straight week. It seems to be a neverending honeymoon above the $65,000 mark. It isn’t up, it isn’t down, it’s rangebound, and there it will stay until the battle between buyers and sellers is won:

The consolidation BTC is experiencing now is muted compared to the last cycle. Here is a chart of the daily % change in bitcoin’s price for the last four years. Note that during the 2021 bull run, intraday price swings were much larger on average compared to today’s bull run. The range of daily % changes during the last bull market was roughly between -3% and +5%, while the range during this bull market is roughly between -2.5% and +3%. Though volatility is a hallmark of bitcoin’s monetization, it is getting less extreme with each passing cycle:

The prelim consumer survey from the University of Michigan for April was released on Friday. Inflation expectations on the 1-year and 5-10-year horizons came in higher than expected, in line with upstream prices that suggest price inflation will remain elevated for several months more, at least. Still, consumer sentiment remains at a 3-year high, almost entirely due to elevated stock prices. Asset owners are living the dream in this high-rate and inflationary environment. The asset poor? Not so much:

Finally, Fed members came out all throughout the day on Friday and walked back rate cut expectations for 2024, either calling for one or none. As discussed on Wednesday, this is in stark contrast to their tenor over the last six months. Powell seriously dropped the ball, and Fed members are scrambling to straddle the line between too-easy and too-tight financial conditions. As we come closer to the end of this year, the clock will be ticking on the Fed being able to bring down price inflation before the late-2024 corporate debt maturity wall approaches. If the Fed can’t bring down rates before that point due to still-stubborn price inflation, all bets are off on financial stability in 2025.

In the week ahead, we receive our first look at March consumer numbers in retail sales on Monday and a variety of housing data. We are much more focused on Tax Day and Treasury settlement on Monday, as the 10- and 30-year auctions saw large primary dealer takedowns, meaning dealers will scramble to fund Treasury positions on Monday or sell inventory into the market. With our eyes on SOFR and the broad repo funding market, we’ll look to any minutia next week in the money markets for signs that ample reserves are no longer ample and whether the Fed starts to discuss the early end to Quantitative Tightening. Generally, the market will be more focused on the aftermath of last week’s CPI and its impact on volatility. War drums have also started to sound, meaning that Friday price action could see reversals next week or intensification depending on geopolitical developments. Twenty-year Treasuries will also be auctioned next week:

In this episode, Nik is joined by veteran trader Craig Shapiro to discuss the diminishing role of the dollar in international trade settlement. Craig introduces the petrodollar as an instrument in marginal decline since 2022, why China is resisting US calls for it to revalue its currency stronger, and how gold is responding to a new international monetary system. Learn why the oil trade, Treasury yield curve, and gold's new all-time high are all related.

March consumer prices came in hotter than analyst expectations. The headline number rose from 3.2% prior to 3.5% in March, beating estimates of 3.4%. Core inflation, which removes volatile food and energy prices (despite those being what most people are impacted by), was flat at 3.8%, beating estimates of 3.7%.

Supercore inflation, which is inflation in core services excluding housing, rose to 4.8% year-over-year. According to Torsten Slock from Apollo, core services inflation, which is hugely indicative of consumer spending activity, is accelerating. With a 3-month annualized rate of 8% up from its 6-month annualized rate of 6%, consumers aren’t backing away from services—they are spending more. Even after the holidays.

CPI has now spent 10 of the past 12 months totally unmoved above 3%, which is a full 50% higher than the Fed’s long-run target range of 2% yearly growth. With the Fed’s no-recession mandate further solidified by it being an election year wherein economic slowdowns are forbidden, a price inflation rate of 3.5%, 1.5 times higher than what you’ve been used to for 25 years, is the new normal for the foreseeable future.

2024-04-13 14:03:03,Pillar of Salt,https://web.archive.org/web/20240414121705/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-13/pillar-salt,"From the Slope of Hope:

Allow me to introduce you to a neighbor of mine: Mr. Robert Wenzlau, who lives in the quite posh neighborhood of Crescent Park in my fair city of Palo Alto, California. Bob is a pillar of the community. He is a husband, a father, and a grandfather. He is 67 years old, but he is not retired. He is still the CEO and Founder ofTerradex, an environmental services company he started, which aligns with decades of work he has performed to use science to help the environment. Here is Bob receiving one of his many awards and recognitions.

And here's his mugshot, taken this week. We'll get back to that.

As I mentioned, Mr. Wenzlau created Terradex, a thriving and well-funded company here in Palo Alto, and although I don't know the man, he lives just a couple of blocks away from me.

He has all the markings of a successful person. He's self-made, lives in a multi-million-dollar home, and has raised a family. At the company he founded, he's at the top of the heap, naturally.

Plus, he's had no shortage of honors from the environmental protection industry.

This doesn't mean he's been some picketing hippie with no money. On the contrary, he lives in the comfort of suburbia in this home which, in a tremendous tidbit of irony, is right next door to one of the most successfulreal estate agentsin town. In a moment, you'll see why the aforementioned neighbor is going to be none too pleased at the instant diminishment his home is going to suffer in value.

Until a week ago, however, things were looking pretty posh for Bob.

That is, until the shit utterly hit the fan.

The local news is slathered with this tale of child pornography, lewd propositions to a 12 year old, and the fantasized sexualization (by way of pictures and audio recordings) of the family dog and unnamed members of the family. And, yes, Ididsay the family dog.

Now, allow me to jump in and say this post is in no way some kind ofschadenfreudeor finger-pointing. The man's been accused, not convicted (although things don't look good..............) and, as I said, I don't know this fellow at all, in spite of being proximal. It's still sad to see someone who has spent 67 years building up what by most objective measures would be considered a totally successful life and utterly torching it, just to get his kink on.

I mean, we're all human, and most of us have weaknesses and frailties (although I believe very few creeps into the realm of sexualizing youngsters), but that's where things like self-discipline, self-control, and self-improvement are supposed to activate. That's why they're virtues. Because, whatever demons you're fighting, you've got to dig up the better parts of yourself and win the fight. Otherwise, the results could be catastrophic and permanent.

This will all wend its way through the legal system over many months, I'm sure, butTerradexswiftly decided to upgrade and maintain their website, since they're probably getting more traffic than before.

And, on Twitter, the lighthearted and convivial good wishes..........

.........have been replaced by something which, I guess, really says it all.

2024-04-13 15:45:00,Russia Now Says It Expects 'Unconditional Capitulation Of Zelensky Regime' Before Peace,https://web.archive.org/web/20240414121705/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/russia-now-says-it-expects-unconditional-capitulation-zelensky-government-peace,"Ukrainian cities and especially the country's energy infrastructure have been getting pounded by intensified Russian missile and airstrikes over the past several days and weeks, leading to widespread power outages across the country.

Russia's defense ministrysaidFriday, ""Russian troops delivered48 precision strikes at Ukrainian energy and military-industrial sites, army and mercenaries’ deployment areas over the past week in the special military operation in Ukraine.""

This included a Thursday morning attack whichdestroyed one of Ukraine’s largest power plantsin the Kyiv region. ""The goal of the strike were achieved. All the targets were destroyed,"" Moscow said. Ukrainian authorities are urging those with power to preserve and save their energy usage as much as possible.

President Putin this month said this is a necessary response to Ukraine's own cross-border attacks on Russia's energy sector, which has beendevastating of late, resulting in a significant drop in Russia's gasoline production.

But lost in the global geopolitical headlines, which have been largely driven by the Israel-Gaza war and a showdown over the coming expected Iranian attack on Israel, was the shock statement by Russia's ambassador to the United Nations this week.

During Thursday's UN Security Council meeting, Vasily Nebenzya, the Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations, said that Moscownow expects the ""unconditional capitulation"" of the Zelensky government.

Ambassador Nebenzyatold the body:

In these conditions, attempts by the head of the Kiev regime to promote his formula and convene summits in support of the Kiev regime cause only confusion.

Very soon the only topic for any international meetings on Ukrainewill be the unconditional capitulation of the Kiev regime.

He emphasized in conclusion to these provocative remarks,""I advise you all to prepare for this in advance.""

The increasingly effective Russian strike campaign in Ukraine threatens to constrain Ukraine’s long-term warfighting capabilities and set operational conditions for Russia to achieve significant gains on the battlefield.https://t.co/7t1bLVca6Ipic.twitter.com/MNrpU0HjrE

This firm statement appears part of Russia's continuing reaction to the planned Switzerland-hosted international Ukraine peace conference, which the Swiss government formally announced as set for June 15-16 at the lakeside Bürgenstock resort near Lucerne.

As we underscoredpreviously, while over 100 nations are to be invited, the one country that can determine the final outcome of the war has not been invited: Russia. Its foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has characterized the conference as a""road to nowhere""and a sign that the West is not sincere about a willingness to pursue real peace negotiations.

""That this is a road to nowhere, to put it mildly, is obvious to any normal political observer. Yesterday, Russian President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin once again made our position clear and understandable during the meeting with Alexander Grigoryevich Lukashenko,"" Lavrovexplained.

And given that Russia's ambassador to the UN just declared that the end of the Ukraine war will beconditioned on nothing less than Ukraine's total surrender, the prospect for peace negotiations is now further away than ever. And all the while Europe is still scrambling to find more weapons to ship to Zelensky's military.

2024-04-13 17:30:00,'Surprising' Intensity Of Houthi Attacks Push French Warship To Exit Red Sea,https://web.archive.org/web/20240414121705/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/houthi-uninhibited-attacks-push-french-warship-exit-red-sea,"France's Aquitaine-class FREMM frigate Alsace has turned tail from the Red Seaafter running out of missiles and munitionsrepellingattacksfrom the Yemeni armed forces, according to its commander, Jerome Henry.

""We didn’t necessarily expect this level of threat. There was anuninhibited violence that was quite surprisingand very significant. [The Yemenis] do not hesitate to use drones that fly at water level, to explode them on commercial ships, and to fire ballistic missiles,"" Henry told French news outletLe Figaroin an exclusive interview published on 11 April.

""We had to carry out at least half a dozen assistances following [Yemeni] strikes,"" he added. The commander of the Alsace also revealed that,after a 71-day deployment, all combat equipment was depleted.

""From the Aster missile to the 7.62 machine gun of the helicopter, including the 12.7mm, 20mm, or 76mm cannon, we dealt withthree ballistic missilesand half a dozen drones,"" Henry adds.

According to the French commander, theFranco–Italian Aster missile – each carrying a price tag of up to $2 million – ""was pushed to its limits"" by the Yemeni armed forces, as the Alsace had to use it ""on targets that we did not necessarily imagine at the start.""

Henry added that Sanaa has markedly increased its use of ballistic missiles after relying mainly on suicide drones at the start of Yemen's pro-Palestine operations in the Red Sea and stressed that the French Navy has not faced such a tough battle since NATO collectively launched its 2011 war on Libya to depose the late ruler Muammar Gaddafi.

""I was there too. It wasn't the same thing. It has been even longer since we have engaged with this level of weaponry and violence. The threat to the boat was much greater in the Red Sea,"" Henry notes.

The Alsaceenteredthe Red Sea in late January, a few weeks after the US and the UK launched an illegal war on Yemen to protect Israeli shipping interests. The frigate was deployed as part of the EU naval operation Aspides – Greek for shield.

With a mandate initially set for one year, Aspides saw the deployment of several EU warships and airborne early warning systems to the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, and surrounding waters. According to authorities in Brussels, the mission is exclusively defensive, and its forces are not taking part in US-led attacks against Yemen.

Aspides came together after several NATO members proved hesitant oroutright refusedto join the flounderingOperation Prosperity Guardian(OPG), which a top US commander called one of the largest battles the navy has fought since the end of World War II.

""We favor a diplomatic solution. We know that there is no military solution,"" US Special Envoy for Yemen Timothy Lenderking said earlier this month, acknowledging the futility of Washington's military strategy against the Arab world's poorest country.

According to Yemeni sources who spoke withThe Cradle, US officialsrecently offered Sanaa ""an acknowledgment of its legitimacy"" in exchange for its neutrality in the ongoing war on Gaza.

🇮🇷🇮🇱 Iran seized the Israeli ship MSC ARIES in the Strait of Hormuz.This is a big game changer.This once again is confirming that the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Qatar are helping Israel bypass the Houthi blockade by land route from the UAE port.Iran is now cutting…pic.twitter.com/D47J0jbvRU

""[Washington] pledged to repair the damages, remove foreign forces from all occupied Yemeni lands and islands, and remove Ansarallah from the State Department’s ‘terrorism list’ – as soon as they stop their attacks in support of Gaza,""The Cradlecolumnist Khalil Nasrallah cited the sources as saying.

The offer also includes ""severely reducing"" the role of the Saudi-appointed Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) and ""accelerating the signing of a roadmap"" with the Saudi-led coalition to end the nine-year war that has decimated Yemen.

Nevertheless, Yemeni officials have maintained that their operations in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and the Indian Ocean will continue until Israel stops the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. ""From the coast of the Red Sea or from outside it, we can achieve the goals we want in defense of our country and support of Palestine … We still have many military surprises, and there are military operations that we are keeping secret as part of a specific media strategy,""Mohammad Ali al-Houthi, a senior member of Yemen's Supreme Political Council, announced on April 3.

2024-04-13 18:05:00,"Afghan Migrant On Terror List Released By Immigration Judge, Free To Roam USA",https://web.archive.org/web/20240414121705/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/afghan-migrant-terror-list-released-immigration-judge-free-roam-usa,"An Afghan man and illegal immigrant who's on the FBI terror watchlist has been twice apprehended in the United States only to be releasedby a federal apparatus that continues to make a mockery of the very notion of ""border security.""

Mohammad Kharwin, 48, was first arrested in Southern California in March 2023 after he'd illegally entered the United States from Mexico, according toNBC News, which was first to report the story.Border police suspected Kharwin was on the watchlist,because one unspecified attribute matched his entry on the list.

However,for lack of additional corroborating data, he was processed and released, just like hordes of other illegal migrants before and since. He was instructed to periodically call an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer, but was free to apply for asylum and permission to work in the United States. He was also free to board domestic flights.

This February, the FBI alerted ICE that they suspected Kharwin had links to a terrorist group and could pose a danger. That prompted ICE to track him down in San Antonio and arrest him on Feb. 28.

Buckle in, because the story's about to get a lot worse.On March 28, Kharwin had an immigration hearing in Pearsall, Texas. The ICE prosecutors told the judge that Kharwin was a flight risk who should be detained without bond. However,they didn't tell the judge that he posed a potential risk to national security,and declined to show the judge information revealing why the FBI is concerned about him.

Kept in the dark, the unnamed immigration judge ordered that Kharwin be released, but demanded an above-average-for-illegal-immigrants $12,000 bond. Kharwin immediately paid it and off he went, without any court-mandated restrictions on his travel within the country. He is supposed to appear for another hearing next spring. ICE hasn't appealed the ruling and, inNBC's reporting,there's no indication authorities are seeking him.

According to the watchlist, the FBI believes Kharwin is a member of an Afghanistan group called Hezb-e-Islami (HIG), which has been designated by the United States as a terror group.

According to theOffice of the Director of National Intelligence,HIG is a “virulently anti-Western insurgent group”that sought to overturn the Western-backed Afghan government before its fall in 2021.

HIG wasresponsible for attacks in Afghanistan that killed at least nine American soldiers and civiliansbetween 2013 and 2015. The group is not seen as a top threat in terms of attacks inside the U.S.

Believe it or not,there are some 1.8 million names on the FBI's terror watchlist,and, as has been observed in the colossal rolling clusterf**k at Guantanamo Bay,the US government sometimes misidentifies people-- withpositively godawful results. That said, the FBI could well be correct about Kharwin, and the handling of his March immigration hearing is certainly a cause for concern.

There have been similar cases where watchlisted men have been processed and released. In February, wedetailedthe case ofa man who allegedly is/was a member of the Somali terror group al-Shabaab. He was also caught in southern California in March 2023 and set free to roam the country.

In 2023 the Border Patrol caught 172 suspects from the terror watchlist attempting to enter the US illegally. According to former DHS officials,the constant deluge of illegal migrants through the southern border has made it easier for bad actors to enter the country. According toNBC's analysis of government data, about 0.02% of encountered illegal immigrants are on the terror watchlist --making them needles in a Biden-enlarged haystack.

2024-04-13 19:15:00,The Exodus Continues: Blue Regions Still Bleeding As Residents Escape Democrat Policies,https://web.archive.org/web/20240414121705/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/exodus-continues-blue-regions-still-bleeding-residents-escape-democrat-policies,"Can Democrats take a hint?The answer is obviously no, but with millions of people flooding out of Democrat controlled places and relocating to more conservative regions one might think they would finally get the message.

Blue cities and states across the US have been experiencing a mass exodus of legal residents since before the pandemic event; many of them business owners taking their money (and job opportunities) with them.  The hardest hit states in the country include New York, Illinois and California, with cities like NYC, LA, Chicago and San Francisco seeing some of the most aggressive population shift.  In states like California the standard operating procedure has been to lie about the situation, using the surge of illegal immigrants to hide population loss in the census.

There are a multitude of reasons for the great American migration:  The pandemic lockdowns made many people realize Democrats are inclined towards authoritarian policies and they left because they wanted freedom. Sanctuary status is allowing illegals to flood into blue areas, straining welfare programs and inflating housing costs.  The bureaucracy of leftist cities creates a concrete barrier to success for most small to medium business owners, and even larger companies and chains are ready to exit because of high taxes and over-regulation.  Finally, soft prosecution laws in blue states and cities have led to a clear spike in criminal activity which Democrats are also trying to deny.

It's estimated by Zillow's chief economist that establishing a residency in California wouldrequire around $1 millionor more in starting money.  The state has the second highest cost of living in the nation, as well as theworst reported job growthin the nation in 2023.  Property prices are exploding higher, but with fewer and fewer buyers.  This is probably why California has been dead last on the list of most desirable states to move to for the past few years running.

No one wants to be left holding the bag in a state or city where it's becoming impossible to leave.  For people with the money, relocation is a no-brainer.

Another factor which is going mostly ignored by the establishment media is the rising trend of political disassociation.  The left has become so extreme in their views and behavior that the rest of the populace doesn't want to deal with them anymore.  Conservatives and independents are rushing for the exits to get as far away from these people as possible.

Contrary to popular fears among conservatives, the exodus has not pushed voting numbers towards progressive politicians or policies in the slightest.  In fact, Idaho has reported a considerableinflux of conservative votersmoving in after escaping blue states.  Similar reports are coming out of Texas and Florida.  There is no blue tide.  There is no California takeover - Red states are only turning more red.

Are progressives moving out of the cities, too?  Yes, to the suburbs and to outlying towns within driving distances of their original homes.  It's getting to the point where even leftists are admitting their own cities are not livable. The latest U-Haul data helps to explain the developments more clearly.

The exodus is now having visible effects on Democrat havens that can no longer be hidden.  Crime activity is so suffocating that many corporate chains are leaving, only to be threatened by city politicianswith legal reprisalsif they shut down.  If Democrats can't trick people into staying, they plan to force people to stay.

2024-04-13 19:50:00,"The Hidden Cost Of Progressivism, Part I",https://web.archive.org/web/20240414121705/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/hidden-cost-progressivism-part-i#comment-stream,"Authored by David Parker via The Epoch Times,

With the U.S. Constitution, the Founding Fathers created a nation ofmaximum individual freedom, maximum individual responsibility, limited government, and classical liberalism. Having fled anti-democratic European aristocracy, privileged class structure, and limited opportunity, American colonists did not want government in their lives. The Founding Fathers believed that Adam Smith was correct when he said individuals independently pursuing their self-interest to survive naturally organize society.Without government planning, it was the invisible hand of nature.

In 1933, America flipped that vision.To progressives, freedom now meant freedom with government. President Franklin Roosevelt turned government from a neutral third party, whose sole purpose is to protect life, liberty, and property, to government as an active third party, whose sole purpose is to provide life, liberty, and property. This is the nation we have today, where all citizens (to some degree) are dependent on government.

That reversal comes with a cost:the hidden cost of progressivism.

Every individual or family earning $50,000 per year is, today, paying a hidden tax of at least $28,100 per year over and above federal and state income tax.

Government has so regulated the market for health care that the market no longer exists. American health insurance today is not insurance; it’s prepaid health care—that’s why it costs two to three times what it should, two to three times what it costs anywhere else in the world. With health insurance in the United States automatically paying for most procedures, citizens no longer bargain over price. To nothing else in life are they so indifferent. Citizens in New Jersey, for instance, are indifferent to the fact that the price of health insurance in Pennsylvania is three times less. In complete violation of interstate commerce, progressive federal law forbids citizens from purchasing health insurance across state lines. Before Medicare, the cost of health insurance was $200 per month (in 2022 dollars), $50 per month for a young person—the price of auto insurance, property insurance on a $1 million home, or life insurance. Today, it’s $600 per month, provided your employer contributes an additional $800 to $1,000. The employer doesn’t care; it’s a tax write-off. Eliminate government from health care, and the price of health insurance will drop by 66 percent. Ask your employer to give you what he’s paying on your behalf. It’s your money. $800 per month times 12 is $9,600 per year. Hidden tax one.

Social Security takes 15 percent of your income. You pay 7.5 percent, and your employer pays 7.5 percent, but it’s money your employer would otherwise have given you. Fifteen percent, however, is more than is necessary. Properly invested, 10 percent is sufficient. That 5 percent differential on $50,000 is $2,500 per year. Hidden tax two. (That 10 percent of $50,000, $5,000, when invested at 5 percent annual interest compounded monthly, in 40 years is worth $658,194. In 50 years, $1,147,283.)

In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson said unequivocally that there would be no increase in taxes for the War on Poverty. A gullible nation now knows that, to date, that “war” has cost $23 trillion; that the poverty rate, 15 percent in 1964, on average, remained 15 percent; and that today, the war is paid for by borrowing. Roughly $900 billion per year (15 percent of the federal budget) divided by 150 million taxpayers is $6,000 per person. Hidden tax three.

Until 1890, schools were private. Parents who couldn’t afford to send their children were provided the means—from property taxes. Thank you, Thomas Jefferson. But then progressives amalgamated them into today’s government-administered unified school districts—except that once a huge enterprise becomes a government project, it’s open to rent-seeking and politicization. This allowed political pressure in the 1970s to force public schools to try to create equal outcomes for all students—which they found was impossible without lowering standards, which is why middle-class parents pulled their children and sent them to private schools at a cost of $20,000 to $40,000 per year per child. If just one child per family attends private school at $20,000 per year ($10,000 per parent), over and above the property taxes the family already pays (even if they are tenants), that’s hidden tax four.

So if we add up the above hidden taxes, it looks like this: $9,600 plus $2,500 plus $6,000 plus $10,000 equals $28,100.

Actually, there’s much more. Any serious constraint on business causes businesses to raise prices, a hidden tax. Domestic farm subsidies and tariffs on foreign goods raise prices. A hidden tax.

Solution: Reverse all federal legislation since 1933.

Social Security, Medicare, everything—except legislation that reinforces civil rights and national defense. Remove government from the economy, and the federal income tax rate will drop to 15 percent.

Let citizens keep that $28,100 per year! Universal basic income.

In a Jeffersonian democracy, where no citizen is denied the vote, it’s understood that citizens can and do think for themselves.

We’re not living in Plato’s Republic, an island of progressivism, where the nation’s most capable, its aristocracy, are in power. Dictatorship. In Plato’s Republic, the masses didn’t vote.

The wealthy do not object to high income taxes; they’re not paying!Let the middle class continue to pay!

Large corporations do not object to regulation and monitoring by government. They can afford the millions of dollars in legal fees to comply—Sarbanes-Oxley, Dodd-Frank—then buy up the smaller firms that cannot. Monopoly. Let them continue to do that!The corporations that survive create the efficient corporate state: Bismarck, Mussolini, Hitler, China. National socialism!

For U.S. prosperity, all that’s necessary is that the United States has less regulation than elsewhere in the world. That would give the United States an enormous competitive advantage.Let governments worldwide tax and regulate business, forcing them to increase prices, and prices in the United States will be lower. U.S. manufacturing and exports will rise.

Let the United States offer more social, political, and economic freedom than elsewhere in the world, and it will continue to attract the world’s most independent and entrepreneurial talent - what enabled the United States to go to the moon in 1969(German scientists), what today keeps the United States at the forefront of high technology, information technology, and quantum computing(71 percent of those in Silicon Valley are foreign-born).With American public schools being the lowest achieving in the industrialized world, with foreign students outscoring American students on the SAT and enrolling in U.S. universities,let smart immigrants continue to arrive.

The U.S. has nothing to worry about...

2024-04-13 20:25:00,Watch: Non-English Speaking Military-Aged Venezuelan Male Attempts To Rob Bank In Ohio Using Translator App,https://web.archive.org/web/20240414121705/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/watch-non-english-speaking-military-aged-venezuelan-male-attempts-rob-bank-ohio-using#comment-stream,"President Biden's disastrous open southern border policies have sparked a migrant crime wave. This comes amid the ten million plus illegal aliens that have invaded the nation through the collapsed southern border, alongside recent calls from radical progressive lawmakers across crime-ridden metro areas to defund the police and limit criminal prosecution. All of this is a perfect storm of crime and chaos heading into the summer months.

According to Bloomberg data, the story count featuring ""migrant crime"" has surged from only a handful of headlines to hundreds in the last 3.5 months.

Some of these headlines include Chilean crime gangs roaming the nation on a burglary spree,targeting wealthy neighborhoodsfrom coast to coast. Some migrants have even taken to social media to inform others about seizing homes from Americans under progressive squatting laws. Others run amuck in progressive metro areas where Soros-backed district attorneys fail to prosecute some criminals.

The latest instance of the migrant invasion and escalating crime wave was a 20-year-old illegal alien from Venezuela who attempted to rob a bank in Sandusky, Ohio.

On April 4, Sandusky Police were called to the West Perkins Avenue bank for a 'suspicious man loitering', according to local media outletSandusky Register.

""While en route to the bank, officers received additional information that Yeixon Brito-Gonzalez, who only spoke Spanish, was asking tellers to put money in a white trash bag,"" the paper said.

Video released of the attempted robbery shows the illegal alien using a translator app on a smartphone to instruct the teller to load a trash bag full of cash.

Here's more from the Sandusky Register:

In speaking with bank personnel, officers learned that Brito-Gonzalez had attempted to get behind the bank counter and then sat in a chair.

He purportedly showed a teller his phone several times with messages translated into English from Spanish. The messages directed the teller to get money and place it in a white trash bag Briton-Gonzalez had with him.

Officers later located Brito-Gonzalez in the 1300 block of E. Parish St. They learned he only spoke Spanish so they called in an officer who is fluent in that language, the report states.

It was discovered that he had a white trash bag in his possession. He also voluntarily showed officers his phone, and they found a translation application on it, according to Sandusky police Chief Jared Oliver.

Brito-Gonzalez was arrested based upon statements he made as well as witness statements, however officers were unable to positively identify him at the time due to his not having any identification documents.

He was ordered held at Erie County Jail under a no-bond order. Officers were later able to identify him through the use of an FBI fingerprint database, Oliver said.

As of late Friday, Brito-Gonzalez is still incarcerated in Erie County Jail under a no-bond order. In addition to his charges from the attempted robbery, US Border Patrol is actively involved in this case as well.

This incident serves as a reminder for every law-abiding American that some military-aged migrants who were unvetted and flooded this nation are escalating their rampage across the country.

And Biden's migrant invasion continues to spiral out of control.

NEW: CBP just released new data which reveals 404,000 migrants have now been flown directly into the U.S. under the Biden admin’s CHNV parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, & Venezuelans, which grants the recipients two years of humanitarian parole in the U.S. and…

The migrant crisis the White House helped create is a public safety risk - already killing Americans. Yet, the White House ignores.

Former President Donald Trump has suggested thathe would support Republicans approving Ukraine aid in the form of a loan, but that Europe must “equalize” its efforts to help Ukrainein its war against Russia.

During apress conferenceat his Mar-a-Lago residence with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), President Trump said they are “thinking about making it in the form of a loan instead of just a gift.”

“We keep handing out gifts of billions and billions of dollars, and we’ll take a look at it,”the former president said.

“But much more importantly to me is the fact that Europe has to step up, and they have to give money. They have to equalize. If they don’t equalize I’m very upset about it, because they’re affected much more than we are.”

President Trump has been skeptical of Washington’s support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and said that he would bring the fighting to an end within 24 hours if he were to return to the White House.

The former president has previouslycalled onthe U.S. government to stop sending money in the form of foreign aid to any country “unless it is done as a loan.”

Mr. Johnson, who was also present during the press conference, has delayed for months a House vote on legislation already passed by the Democratic-led Senate providing $60 billion in aid for Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President VolodymyrZelenskyytolda local broadcaster last week that his government would be open to accepting U.S. aid in the form of loan if that is the only option left.

“You know, a senator was here recently, and he asked me: would you agree to take the loan money? I said, ‘What are the options?’ He said, ‘Well, if, for example, they tell you that the money is a loan or you won’t get it.’ I said, ‘What’s the point of such an election if there is no choice?’

“Let’s be honest: we will agree to any option. I'll tell you more: if Ukraine was offered a package on credit today or free of charge in a year, we would say: only today. There is no choice here. Our only choice is to survive and win. We are trying to do this in different ways. This is about the loan. Important: the sooner the better,”he said.

But Mr. Zelenskyy said he remains optimistic in getting “a positive vote” from the U.S. Congress.

“Unfortunately, we are a bit hostage to this situation.Unfortunately, the issue of Ukraine, namely the issue of Russia’s war against Ukraine,has become a domestic political issue in the United States today. Although this is the security of the whole world,” he remarked.

Mr. JohnsontoldFox News on March 31 that legislation to provide additional aid for Ukraine is being drafted in the House and will be brought to the floor when members return from their current recess.

“When it comes to the supplemental, we’ve been working to build that consensus. We’ve been talking to all the members, especially now over the district work period. When we return after this work period, we’ll be moving a product, but it’s going to, I think, have some important innovations,”he said.

Mr. Johnson has been supportive of continued aid for Ukraine but has also stressed the importance of securing the United States’s own borders first.

When the Senate passed legislation that included funding for both Ukraine and immigration enforcement, he led the opposition in the House on the grounds that the bill heavily prioritized Ukraine and offered no significant border policy reforms.

As of yet, there has been no agreement reached on the crisis at the U.S.–Mexico border. While President Joe Biden and Democrats say additional funding is needed to stop the historic surge of illegal immigrants into the United States, Republicans hold that the president already possesses the funds and authority to fix the problem.

2024-04-13 21:35:00,Investors Bet On Further Rise In US Gasoline Prices,https://web.archive.org/web/20240414121705/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/investors-bet-further-rise-us-gasoline-prices#comment-stream,"By John Kemp, senior energy analyst at Reuters

Portfolio investors have amassedone of the largest bullish positions in U.S. gasoline futures and options since before the coronavirus pandemic, anticipating that prices will continue climbing over the next few months.

U.S. gasoline has emerged asthe most attractive part of the petroleum complex for investors betting prices will rise further this yearin the run up to presidential and congressional elections in November.

Relatively low inventories, employment gains, strong household income growth and the prospect of an active hurricane season are expected to keep gasoline consumption high and inventories under pressure.

Ukraine’s drone attacks on refineries in Russia threaten to tighten the international supply situation even further and have prompted the Biden administration to warn Ukraine’s government to change its targeting.

U.S. gasoline consumption is correlated with employment and household incomes so the current rise in nonfarm jobs and wage rates are likely to underpin strong use in 2024.

Domestic consumption has been trending structurally lower since 2007 as a result of improvements in fuel economy, ethanol blending and more recently the deployment of electric and hybrid vehicles. But lower domestic use has been more than offset by strong growth in exports, mostly to Mexico and other countries in Latin America, which has kept overall refinery production trending higher.

Strong domestic consumption during the peak summer driving season is likely to cause inventories to tighten cyclically and exert upward pressure on prices in 2024.

ACTIVE HURRICANE SEASON

Nearly half of the total refinery capacity in the U.S. is located along the Gulf of Mexico on the coasts of Texas and Louisiana.

Every year there is a small but non-zero chance refinery processing will be disrupted by a direct hit from a major hurricane.

The North Atlantic hurricane season lasts from June through November with activity peaking in August and September (“Tropical cyclone climatology”, U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2024).

The precise number of storms, their intensity and the location of landfalls is highly variable and notoriously difficult to predict months in advance.

But the expected shift from El Nino to La Nina conditions underway in the central and eastern Pacific is often associated with an increased number and intensity of hurricanes in the Atlantic (“Impacts of El Nino and La Nina on the hurricane season,” NOAA, 2014).

At the same time, Atlantic storm creation and intensity is strongly correlated with sea surface temperatures in the Caribbean and the tropical North Atlantic.

Tropical storm formation requires sea surface temperatures of at least 26°C, among a number of other conditions (“Cyclogenesis”, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, 2017).

Sea surface temperatures in the tropical North Atlantic were at a record seasonal high in March 2024, according to data from the U.S. Climate Prediction Centre.

Sea surface temperatures surged higher around the world, including a very strong warm El Nino phenomenon in the Pacific, but the exceptional warming was most pronounced in the Atlantic.

Surface temperatures in the Atlantic from 5° to 20° North and from 30° to 60° West averaged almost 27.1°C in March, which was more than 1.5°C above the long-term seasonal average.

If the surface warmth persists into the second and third quarters it is likely to result in an above average number of tropical storms and more major hurricanes in 2024 and an elevated threat to the Gulf Coast refineries.

Colorado State University researchers have predicted an “extremely active” hurricane season in 2024 (“Forecast for 2024 hurricane activity,” CSU, April 4, 2024).

The number of named tropical storms and hurricanes is expected to be more than 50% higher than the long-term average.

Hedge funds and other money managers owned bullish long positions equivalent to 99 million barrels on April 2, the highest number for more than four years.

After adjusting for a minority of bearish short positions, the net position was 84 million barrels, which was in the 88th percentile for all weeks since 2013.

Fund managers were more bullish on gasoline than on crude (56th percentile) or middle distillates such as diesel and gas oil (53rd percentile).

Bullish long positions in gasoline outnumbered bearish short ones by a ratio of more than 6.4:1 (68th percentile) on April 2.

The long-short ratio suggests positioning is less stretched than the absolute number of long positions, but there is still downside risk to prices when long positions are unwound.

On April 5, U.S. gasoline inventories were 5 million barrels (-2% or -0.42 standard deviations) below the prior ten-year seasonal average.

Stocks had been as much as 7 million barrels (+3% or +0.75 standard deviations) above seasonal average in late January.

But a site-wide power failure stopped BP’s massive refinery at Whiting, Indiana, lasting for more than a month from the start of February and resulted in a sharp depletion of stocks.

Since the refinery restarted in March, the deficit has narrowed slightly, but inventories remain below normal for the time of year, putting upward pressure on prices.

U.S. retail gasoline prices (including taxes) averaged $3.54 per gallon in March 2024, almost exactly in line with the average since the start of the century once inflation is taken into account.

Inflation-adjusted prices have risen from a recent low of $3.22 in January 2024 but are still well below the recent high of $5.42 in June 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Fund managers are betting heavily that gasoline prices will rise further over the remainder of the year.

From a purely positioning perspective, the large number of bullish long positions that must eventually be liquidated has itself created downside risk to prices.

From a fundamental perspective, however, low inventories, strong consumption, threat to Russia’s refineries, and elevated hurricane risk to U.S. refineries are all sources of upside potential.

2024-04-13 22:10:00,Snopes Changed Fact-Check After Pressure From Biden Administration: Emails,https://web.archive.org/web/20240414121705/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/snopes-changed-fact-check-after-pressure-biden-administration-emails,"Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,

The fact-checking website Snopes changed one of its ratings after pressure from President Joe Biden’s administration, newly disclosed emails show.

Snopes on Jan. 10, 2023,saidthat there was some truth to a claim that President Biden’s administration was planning to ban gas stoves.

Under a heading of “what’s true,”Snopes said that “The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), a federal agency, iscurrently considering a ban on gas stoves if they can’t be made safer, due to concerns over harmful indoor pollutants that cause health and respiratory problems.”

Under another heading, it said that the ban has not been put in place.

The article quoted Richard Trumka Jr., a CPSC commissioner, as saying that“any option is on the table” when dealing with gas stoves. “Products that can’t be made safe can be banned,”Mr. Trumkatold Bloomberga few days prior.

Pamela Rucker Springs, a spokeswoman for the CPSC, hours after the rating was publishedcontactedSnopes writer Nur Ibrahim, the newly disclosed emails show.

She said she it was “not accurate to say that CPSC is ‘considering a ban on gas stoves’ and that Mr. Trumka’s views ”do not represent official statements on behalf of the commission.”

“We would appreciate a correction to this story,”Ms. Springs said.

Mr. Ibrahim responded the following day saying Snopes would “correct the article.”

Snopes then changed the fact-check rating from “mixture” to “false.”

The CPSC “is not currently considering a ban on gas stoves, though a commissioner said ‘anything is on the table’ if they can’t be made safer,” the updated article states.

Ms. Springssenta link to the updated page to White House official Michael Kikukawa, the newly disclosed documents show. “Sent over tough letter to this writer yesterday when the initial claim was rated as ’mixed,'” she wrote.

“Nice!! So helpful going forward,”Mr. Kikukawa responded.

Mr. Kikuwaka told Ms. Springs in another email that the White House would be circulating a statement “making clear POTUS does not support banning gas stoves” and sharing social media posts from the commission and Mr. Trumka. “Will also be pushing people your way,” he wrote.

The emails were obtained by the Functional Government Initiative nonprofit through the Freedom of Information Act.

“A commissioner appointed by President Biden wanted to ban gas stoves, and he got caught, provoking a public outcry. So, the CPSC staff leaned on Snopes, seeking to counter the narrative by splitting hairs about commission processes. And the White House finds this ‘helpful.’ Helpful with what?“Pete McGinnis, spokesman for the nonprofit, said in a statement.

”This goes beyond dysfunction—the government using sympathetic media to censor inconvenient news. The American people deserve both to keep their gas stoves and to know the truth about what regulations government officials are considering.”

Snopes did not respond to a request for comment.

The CPSC framed the possibility of banning stoves as solely on Mr. Trumka, issuing a statement from Alexander Hoehn-Saric.

The chairman of the commission said, “I am not looking to ban gas stoves and the CPSC has no proceeding to do so.”

At the same time, CPSC officials acknowledged that they were investigating emissions from gas stoves and were “exploring new ways to address any health risks.”

Mr. Trumka saidin an internal memorandumreviewed by The Epoch Times that there was “sufficient information” for the commission to issue a notice of a proposed rule “proposing to ban gas stoves in homes.”He told Peter Feldman, another commissioner, that “emerging evidence” showed that “gas stoves in homes emit toxic gases that cause illnesses and that lower-cost, safer alternatives are available.” The Committee to Unleash Prosperity, which obtained the memo, said that it proved the administration ”intended to ban gas stoves.”

The CPSC laterapproveda final noticeof rulemaking offered by Mr. Trumka asking for “proposed solutions” to “hazards” from gas stoves.

That notice has not appeared to have resulted in a new rule as of yet.

Separately, the U.S. Department of Energyissueda proposed rule that would ban about half of the gas stoves on the market.When the final rulewas releasedin January, though, it had been watered down and only affected about three percent of gas stoves.

2024-04-13 23:20:00,Illegal Immigration Costs American Households Hundreds Of Billions Annually,https://web.archive.org/web/20240414121705/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/illegal-immigration-costs-american-households-hundreds-billions-annually,"Authored by Chadwick Hagan via The Epoch Times,

Illegal immigration weighs heavily on the wallets of hardworking American taxpayers- to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars annually.

Still, theBiden administration turns a blind eye to these fiscal strains, neglecting the toll on our economy, the structural integrity of our nation, and the safety of our citizens.

Estimates suggest that illegal immigrants cost each household about $1,000, adding up to more than $120 billion a year.

Sources such as Newsweek hint that the true cost may be even higher, possibly reaching $150 billion annually, an amount shared by both federal and state governments. In all actuality, the financial impact could be much worse.

The situation continues to deteriorate by the day. Just this past December, Border Patrol recorded 249,785 arrests along the Mexican border, a 31 percent spike from November 2023 and a 13 percent surge from the December 2022 record.

Since President Joe Biden’s inauguration and the adoption of his open borders approach, more than 7.2 million illegal immigrants have streamed into the United States through the southern border, a number surpassing the population of 36 states.

Some estimate that number to be nearer to 10 million. The lawlessness makes it impossible to keep an accurate count.

The repercussions of illegal immigration cast long shadows over various aspects of our society, from heightened crime rates to suppressed wages to the depletion of taxpayer resources.Public services face strain, with illegal immigrants accessing emergency health care, enrolling their children in public schools, and tapping into social welfare programs. Some argue their willingness to accept lower wages drives down earnings, leading to reduced tax revenues and increased reliance on social welfare programs among low-wage workers, citizens, and legal residents alike. Even our property tax is paying for illegal immigrants. This generational problem demands pragmatic consideration and competent leadership.

To exacerbate matters, if illegal immigrants operate solely within cash transactions, much of their income goes undocumented.

This is why I advocate for measures such as the Fair Tax Act, which replaces income tax with a consumption tax, ensuring revenue from cash transactions is taxed.

While proponents argue that illegal immigrants are paying into our tax system, and even our Social Security system, it is hard to tell the difference between fact and fiction.

According to a 2023 National Bureau of Economic Research paper (Working Paper 31086, “Measuring the Characteristics and Employment Dynamics of U.S. Inventors”),the majority of innovation in America is driven by white and Asian (including Indian) individuals.

The paper estimates that 96.5 percent of U.S. inventors were white or Asian as of 2016.

The question remains:Why are we allowing our borders to be overrun by illegal immigrants when we need controlled and tactical immigration to pay into our depleted social systems and kick-start the next wave of innovation?

Why would the United States prohibit valuable workers from becoming American citizens while on work visas yet entice unskilled and impoverished workers to enter the country and stay illegally?

These unanswered questions only add fuel to the fires of conspiracy and intrigue.

Giving priority to visas for highly skilled workers will not only strengthen our domestic initiatives but also stimulate innovation and bolster economic growth. It is beyond puzzling that the United States of America continues to welcome unskilled workers when our nation’s prosperity hinges on innovation and skilled labor. The Democratic Party’s reluctance to use the term “illegal immigrants,” echoed by figures such as Nikki Haley, is equally confusing. As Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis rightly pointed out, coming to this country illegally is illegal.

We need to fast-track immigrants who are likely to innovate and create wealth instead of prioritizing low-skilled workers.

It’s time for responsible leadership to step up and implement immigration policies that benefit the United States and the American people.

2024-04-13 23:59:00,"Biden Tells Bibi: US Will Not Support A Counterattack Against Iran After Hundreds Of Drones, Missiles Sent",https://web.archive.org/web/20240414121705/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/us-pressuring-china-turkey-saudi-arabia-intervene-iran-halt-attack-israel#comment-stream,"Update(Midnight ET):It is just after 7am Israel local time and Israel's military is reporting the Iranian attack has stopped, several hours after Iran said its 'limited' operation has ""concluded"" - which involved an unprecedented hundreds of suicide drones as as well as ballistic missiles sent against Israel in retaliation for the April 1st Israeli attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus. Below is the top story from English-languageTimes of Israel:

Hebrew media reports claim thatnot a single drone or cruise missile managed to infiltrate Israeli airspace.

According to the unsourced reports,most ballistic missiles were also knocked down outside of Israeli airspace.

A report in Ynet says some 20 cruise missiles were downed short of Israel’s borders. The US, UK and Jordan helped take down many of the drones.

Israel is reporting very little damage inside the country (though previously admitting ""minor damage"" against at least one key airbase in the south).

After the enormous Iranian drone and missile swarm a senior Israeli official has been quoted by Israel's Channel 12 as saying""Iran’s attack was a strategic failure.""The official added in a threatening manner, ""Now they can get readyand not sleep in peace."" Israel's war cabinet appears to be readying a military response...

⚡️Hebrew Media: The Cabinet approves the implementation of a strong response on Iranian soil

Crucially, the Biden White House appears to be strongly signaling to the Netanyahu government that the attack is 'done' and that the United States will not back any follow-up counterattackoperations against Iran:

US President Joe Biden told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thatthe US will not aid any Israeli counterattack on Iran, US media report, citing senior administration officials.

Axios and CNN report that message was passed during a phone call between the pair.

Axios reports thatBiden told Netyanyahu the US will oppose any Israeli counterattack.

CNN reports that Biden saidthe US will not take part in any such counteraction.

Israel has called on a United Nations Security Council meeting to condemn the Iranian aggression, which is expected to take place late Sunday. The US administration appears to be lobbying for a status quo and for Israel to not mount a strong response.

Below is a portion of the Axios report on the Bibi-Bidenlate night phone call:

Behind the scenes:Biden told Netanyahu the joint defensive efforts by Israel, the U.S. and other countries in the regionled to the failure of the Iranian attack, according to the White House official.

Meanwhile, Israel's official channels are filled with 'fighting words' like the following:

Israelis’ reality in the last hours:pic.twitter.com/VXeHM8WqJi

Update(20:00ET):CNN is reporting there have beenseveral explosion on the ground across Israel, but there's yet to be official confirmation of the extent of casualties. Israeli media is reporting the firstas follows: ""Medics treating first injury from Iran attack –a 10-year-old boyfrom Bedouin town near Arad in serious condition."" The IDF spokesman is confirmingat least one of its military bases has been hit in the south by an Iranian cruise missile, sustaining ""minor damage"". This was reportedly at Dimona, where Israel reportedly has undeclared nuclear weapons, making such a strike highly dangerous. Further Iran's IRNA is reporting:

Iran successfully struck the Israeli airbase in the Negev Desert with 'Khaybar' ballistic missiles.

Importantly,Times of Israelis reporting that Israel's military is preparing a response, in what is likely to become a continuing tit-for-tat in the coming days:

Israel plans a “significant response” to the unprecedented Iranian drone salvoagainst it, top-rated Channel 12 TV quotes an unnamed senior Israeli official as saying early on Sunday.

The IDF has called this new attack a ""major escalation"". Over ""200 different kinds"" of projectiles were fired toward Israel, the IDF spokesman said. For more than the past week Israeli leaders have firmly warned that should Iran launch retaliation from within its own soil, the Israeli response against the Islamic Republic will be 'stronger' - as Netanyahu previously put it. That's precisely what has happened and so a major Israeli response is likely.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has condemned Iran’s attack on Israel, saying it risks plunging the entire region""into chaos.""

“We condemn the ongoing attack in the strongest possible terms, risking to plunge an entire region into chaos,” Baerbockwrote on X. ""Iran and its proxies must stop this immediately. In these hours, we stand firmly by Israel."" However, by and large there was silence from European and NATO leaders when Israel mounted an unprecedented attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus on April 1st.

Meanwhile, theUS says it is still intercepting inbound drones and missiles. The IDF says it has ""numerous"" fighter jets in the air right now. Iran has warned Washington not do get involved in the conflict, saying American bases in the region are at risk if it does so.

An extremely vague Biden statement:

I just met with my national security team for an update on Iran’s attacks against Israel. Our commitment to Israel’s security against threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad.pic.twitter.com/kbywnsvmAx

Al Jazeera LIVE FEED:

Update(1845):Ballistic missiles are still in the air headed for Israel along with more than 100 drones.Live visuals have shown projectiles falling on Israel. Iran is now very publicly saying the matter has ""concluded"":

IRAN’S UN MISSION:“Iran’s military action was in response to the Zionist regime’s aggression against our diplomatic premises in Damascus.The matter can be deemed concluded. However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe. It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!”

From Israel's perspective, Iran has now crossed a red line, and Netanyahu is likely to now see himself as havingcarte blancheto take out Iran nuclear facilities.

Update(1805):Iranian state media has just reported that the elite IRGC haslaunched its first wave of ballisticand(or) cruise missiles at Israel. Already anestimated hundreds of drones are headed toward Israel. It appears Iran is seeking to overwhelm Israel's anti-air defense systems. The United States is expected to help Israel intercept this barrage. There are statements from the Houthis saying they have also launched rockets against Israel, and there are fears Hezbollah is about to unleash a barrage too, with early reports saying dozens of Katyusha rockets have already been sent into northern Israel tonight. Unconfirmed reports have said rockets have been launched from Iranian assets in Syria too.

Below is the IRGC confirmationvia PressTV: ""In response to the Zionist regime’s numerous crimes, including the attack on the consular section of Iran’s Embassy in Damascus and the martyrdom of a number of our country’s commanders and military advisors in Syria, the IRGC’s Aerospace Divisionlaunched tens of missiles and drones against certain targetsinside the occupied territories,"" the statement read. At this point the question is which will hit first: the slower-moving drones which were launched well over an hour ago, or the ballistic missiles which are likely to take less than 30 minutes to reach their targets.

The Iranian attack has an official name, and Tehran is warning that the US and foreign countriesmust 'stay away'from the conflict...

Already hawks in the US are urging Biden to intervene heavily on the side of Israel...

No, it is not. Israel is a foreign country.https://t.co/QUAe9A5vpc

According to an unconfirmed note:

Al Jazeera citing Channel 12: British fighters participate with American fighters in intercepting Iranian marches in the airspace of Jordan and Syria.

Geopolitical analyst Max Abrahms writes that""Iran and Israel are now at war. A real, direct war.""

Update(1554ET):Axios correspondent Barak Ravid has cited several US and Israeli officials who say Iran's attack against Israel has started. It is currently almost 11pm in Israel. It could take hours for the drones to reach Israel, however, the big question remains whether Tehran sends ballistic missiles. Both the IDF and the Biden administration have confirmed that drones are en route to Israeli airspace. Iranian state TV also since confirmed. The White House has said the attack is""likely to unfold over a number of hours.""

""Iran launches attack against Israel using dozens of drones, four U.S. and Israeli officials told me,"" Ravid writes. Airspace across Iran, Iran, Jordan, and Israel has reportedly been shut in the last hours. There are reports citing the Jordanian government saying it stands ready to shoot down any drones that violate its airspace. There are also unconfirmed reports that the Houthis have launched projectiles out of Yemen.

Airspace shut from Iran to Iraq to Jordan...

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued the following nighttime speech just ahead of the reportedattack:

“Citizens of Israel, in recent years, and even more so in recent weeks,Israel has been preparing for the possibility of a direct attack from Iran,” the premier says in a video statement. “Our defense systems are deployed, and we are prepared for any scenario, both in defense and offense.

2024-04-14 00:32:17,The Real Estate Slow Burn...,https://web.archive.org/web/20240415085957/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-14/real-estate-slow-burn,"Amidst the return of the inflation boomerang and the weaponizing economy, and as ‘Forward Confusion’ continues to spread, investors overlooked thesimmering crisis in Commercial Real Estate.However, the issue of vacant office buildings in American cities, transforming them into post-Covid wastelands, will impact the US economy in the coming quarters and beyond. Some pundits suggest that this surge in empty commercial real estate could lead to an utopian turnaround, but the potential for an ""Urban Doop Loop"" triggered by CRE should be widely acknowledged asa possible catalyst for a broader economic meltdown in a still inflationary environment.According to a new report from Moody's Analytics, there are more dormant office towers in the United States than at any point since 1979. This rise in vacancies is driven by a combination of remote and hybrid work trends, prompting companies to reduce their corporate footprints. Additionally, companies are relocating from ‘blue’ progressive cities and high-taxed states to red ones while downsizing their space.

While Bidenomics has fostered a 'higher for longer' narrative in many areas, one enduring trend is thelower for longer occupancy rates for office spacein particular in ‘blue cities’.

Despite this trend, there's an unsettling calm prevailing in the commercial real estate sector for the time being. This comes as the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle is expected to endure, suggesting thatthe challenges are approaching, possibly after the presidential election. While recent positive economic data may have triggeredsome pockets of optimism, the persistentlyhigh office vacancy rate spells trouble for landlords and developers, exacerbated by the difficulties in refinancing amid the Fed's tightening cycle. The total outstanding commercial mortgages set to mature by year-end surged from $658 billion to $929 billion from the beginning of last year to mid-March.

Thehigh amount of debt that has been extended and modified instead of refinancedhas helped to mitigate a potential default wave and sharp increase in losses on CRE loan portfolios. This strategy has been driven by thewillingness of lenders and borrowers to modify and extend maturing loans rather than pursue refinancing or foreclosure.Essentially, the issue has been postponed until after the presidential elections and is part of the ‘Forward Confusion’ narrative spread by Wall Street. However, stresses are mounting in the office segment, with thepercentage of fully paid-off tower loans at maturity dropping below 60%.Meanwhile,the maturity payoff rate for loans backed by other property types has reached near-decade highs.In a nutshell, it has all been about‘EXTEND AND PRETEND’with about47% of the non-bank CMBS loan maturities in 2023 were pushed into 2024.

The key question now ishow long this game of musical chairs will last in the CRE market. While extensions and modifications are not uncommon, the low likelihood of funding costs returning to pre-COVID levels raises concerns about the sustainability of this trend. Modifications will likely persist in the near term due to the uneconomical nature of refinancing for most commercial real estate borrowers and the reluctance of lenders to pursue foreclosures in an illiquid property market. With the politically correct FED most likely unable to cut rate in 2024, the higher-for-longer theme suggestsincreasing risks in the CRE space for 2025. However, there has already translated into asubsequent rise in the delinquency rate of office mortgages securitized into CMBS.

The increasing delinquency rates in the office market will have a particularly harsh impact on the banking sector as a whole, andregional commercial banksin particular. This is because they holdover 65% of the CRE loans.

A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that as many as385 American banks could fail solely due to commercial real estate loans. These would mainly be small regional banks, which typically allocate a third of their assets to commercial real estate loans.

According to a report from the American Banker, five banks in the US together hold half a trillion dollars in CRE loans. Interestingly, JPMorgan Chase, the bank with the largest amount of CRE loans, also has exposure to $49 trillion in derivatives as of December 31, 2023, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

Almost a year ago,Credit Suisse, a major global bank with $540 billion in assets, failed and was merged with UBS. In the US,Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank also collapsedaround the same time. These were the second, third, and fourth biggest bank resolutions since the Great Depression. This banking turmoil representedthe most significant test since the global financial crisis of ending too-big-to-fail, whereby a systemic bank can be resolved while preserving financial stability and protecting taxpayers. While progress has been made in ending too-big-to-fail, further work is needed. Authorities managed to avoid deeper financial turmoil last year, buttaxpayers were again burdened with significant public support to protect more than just insured depositors. Unlike many failures during the global financial crisis,significant losses were shared with shareholdersandsome creditors of the failed banks. However, taxpayers were once again on the hook as extensive public support was used to protect more than just the insured depositors of failed banks. The Credit Suisse acquisition, backed by a government guarantee and liquidity nearly equal to a quarter of Swiss economic output, ultimately entailed significant contingent fiscal risk andcreated a larger, more systemic bank. Using standing resolution powers rather than emergency legislation could have mitigated this. In the US, invoking an exception to protect all deposits in two failed banks increased costs for the deposit insurer, with the industry needing to recoup over time.

Not only is the commercial real estate sector experiencing a slow burn, but theresidential real estate market is also grappling with higher interest rates. Housing starts peaked two years ago at 1.803 million units and have been declining since then, reaching a15.6% decrease by the end of March 2024, returning to pre-pandemic levels.

New home prices have declined by 20% from their peak in October 2022, returning to levels seen before the Federal Reserve initiated its latest interest rate hike cycle in July 2021. Historically,lower home prices have rarely been good news for the performance of the US banking sector, including both large and regional banks.

US New One Family houses prices (blue line); US Bank sector index (BKX) (red line); US Regional Bank sector index (KRX) (green line).

To provide perspective,this current downturn in prices is unprecedented compared to the 2008 housing downturn. At the same point in the 2008 cycle, prices were only down 10%, and by the end of that cycle, 24 months after the peak, they had declined by 22%.

While the focus remains on the Commercial Real Estate market, the housing downturn has been overshadowed by the narrative spread by the financial media. Builders slashing prices for new home sales serves as a leading indicator of impending stress for the real estate market and indirectly affects the banking sector. Not only arebuilders offering discounts on new home prices, but they are also extending discounts on mortgages for new home buyers. For instance, Lennar, one of the leading US homebuilders, is offering a 3/2/1 buydown rate through its Lennar Mortgage service, with rates starting at 1.99% in year 1, 2.99% in year 2, 3.99% in year 3, and 4.99% for the remaining term, resulting in a 5.318% APR.

The additional cost for the homebuilder due to discounts offered is not reflected in official data. Consequently, while the homebuilder's operating margin remains historically high at 25 years, it is expected to experience a significant drop sooner rather than later. Historically,the relative performance of the homebuilder sector compared to the S&P 500 has been closely correlated with the sector's operating margin.In summary,like the banking sector, the homebuilder sector, and everything related to it, appears to be obvious sectors toavoid in the upcoming quarters.

2024-04-14 07:00:00,The Arrival Of Russian Troops In Niger Will Reshape America's Regional Calculations,https://web.archive.org/web/20240414121705/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/arrival-russian-troops-niger-will-reshape-americas-regional-calculations#comment-stream,"Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

It was wondered last monthwhether the US could salvage its Nigerien base dealafter the military authorities scrapped their partnership pact upon being disrespected by visiting American officials.The news thatRussian instructors just entered the countryon a training mission likely spells the end of the Pentagon’s influence there. The departure of US troops might soon follow, though it’s unclear whether it’ll due to the military authorities explicitly demanding it or voluntary to avoid Russia spying on them.

In any case,this is a monumental development since it means that Russian forces are now present in all three of the SahelianAlliance/Confederation’s statesafterdeploying to its Malian coreseveral years back and thenentering Burkina Faso in January. Their bloc alsowithdrew from ECOWASlater that month too, which bolstered their credentials as a new regional integration framework for others to join if they’re interested. The combined effect of all this is that Western influence in the Sahel was dealt a deathblow.

It's premature to pop the champagne, however, since the US is expected to pivot to the Ivory Coastas was explainedherein mid-March two weeks before a topAlt-Mediainfluencer wrote the sameherein a way that indisputably plagiarized some of the aforesaid analysis.

It’s important to share a side-by-side comparison showing the three occasions where the second writer plagiarized the first, since those who were exposed to that later article might not be aware that its ideas were stolen from an earlier one:

* First Article:“Guinea is the top contender (to defect from ECOWAS) due to its recent political history and having the geographic capability to provide the neighboring Sahelian Alliance/Confederation with reliable sea access.”

- Second Article: “Guinea already offers the geographical capacity to provide the alliance with credible maritime access. That will lead to the progressive extinction of the western-controlled, Nigeria-based ECOWAS.”

* First Article:“[The Ivory Coast and Senegal] are thus considered possible ‘targets’ of the Russian-partnered Sahelian Alliance/Confederation, hence the need to ‘protect’ them more than Chad and Gabon. Regarding those last two, Chad has impressively recalibrated its previously Western-centric foreign policy to pragmatically balance between that bloc and Russia.”

- Second Article: “Ivory Coast is more strategic to Washington than, for instance, Chad because Ivorian territory is very close to the Sahel alliance. Still, Chad has already recalibrated its foreign policy, which is no longer Western-controlled and comes with a new emphasis on getting closer to Moscow.”

* First Article:“The stage is therefore set for the US to deploy drones to France’s Ivorian base on exaggerated anti-terrorist pretexts that really serve to keep the Sahelian Alliance/Confederation in check while also monitoring Russian activity there.”

- Second Article: “What lies ahead for Empire? Perhaps US 'anti-terror' drones shared with Paris at the French base in the Ivory Coast to keep the Sahel alliance in check.”

Having clarified for the uninformed reader that whatever they might have read circulating across the Alt-Media Community about this before from that second author was actually plagiarized from the first one, it’s time to move on to analyzing exactly what the consequences could be of such a move.

Prior to Russia’s new training mission in Niger, it was explainedherehow that country might have kept US forces while kicking out the French as geopolitical insurance of sorts from being targeted byHybridWar.

Accordingly, that exact same scenario is now more likely than ever as a result of Niger canceling its aforesaid insurance policy out of self-respect after being disrespected by visiting US officials, though that doesn’t mean that it’s imminent though.

Any potential US drone base redeployment to shared French facilities in the Ivory Coast would place neighboring Burkina Faso and Mali, the latter of which is the newly formed Sahelian Alliance/Confederation’s core, in the West’s crosshairs like never before.

Mali isalready struggling to fend offoffensives from religious extremists and ethnic (Tuareg) separatists, and this could become more difficult if the US and France put more pressure upon it along the southern front. The worst-case scenario for Mali would be if one or both of their spy agencies also begin operating out of Mauritania, which readers can learn a bit more abouthere, and begin to use it and the Ivory Coast in the same way as they’re presently usingPolandto wage theirproxywaron Russia in Ukraine.

Russia might be requested to scale up its military assistance to Mali if that happens, which would probably be sufficient for stopping these Western-backed proxy offensives on the Sahelian Alliance/Confederation’s core state, but then complementary ones might begin elsewhere.

Burkina Faso can also be influenced from the Ivory Coast, while Niger remains vulnerable to influence from historically pro-Western Nigeria even though Abuja has made a big deal aboutwanting to join BRICS.

With these factors in mind, while the possibly impending withdrawal of US forces from Niger is definitely a victory of sorts, the proverbial “Battle for the Sahel” in theNew Cold Waris likely far from over.

Those who celebrate shouldn’t do so excessively because the worst Hybrid War pressure might be yet to come, though that all depends on how competent the American and French spy agencies are, which of course can’t be taken for granted after their spree of regional setbacks over the past few years.

2024-04-14 07:35:00,Watch 'Weaponized Migration' In Action: Hundreds Storm Polish Border From Belarus,https://web.archive.org/web/20240414121705/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/watch-weaponized-migration-action-220-storm-polish-border-belarus,"Coming from Russia-allied Belarus,hundreds of ""very aggressive"" migrants carrying ladders and wielding rocks and tree branches stormed the border of Polandon Wednesday, but were repelled by security forces. Belarus has long been accused of""weaponizing"" migrantsby encouraging them to travel to Belarus only so they can be pushed into Poland and Lithuania.

According to astatementissued by the Polish Border Guard and reporting byBabel,the onslaught took place around 10 am in a marshy area in the dense Białowieża forest, which is a popular butdifficultavenue for attempted crossings by migrants from around the world.

Video shared by the Border Guard shows several pairs ofmigrants marching through the marsh and carrying what appear to be primitive laddersmade from forest wood. Next we see migrants massing along rows of concertina wire laid down in the watery marsh, with Polish security forces confronting them from the other side.

According to the Polish Border Guard statement:

A group of over 220 foreigners tried to enter Poland illegally in this way.The foreigners were very aggressive - they threw tree branches and stonesat the Border Guard and Polish Army patrols to clear their way to Western Europe.

During the incident,a dangerous tool made of wood and nails was confiscatedfrom the foreigners. This attempt was successfully foiled. The migrants retreated deeper into Belarus.

While the government statement didn't describe the origins of the migrants, the news-aggregator Twitter accountVisegrád 24saidthey were from Africa and the Middle East. It did not cite a source for that claim, but it's been previously reported that migrants attempting to enter Poland from Belarus have come from a wide variety of non-European countries, includingAfghanistan, Pakistan, India, Yemen, sub-Saharan Africa, China and Cuba.

In recent years,Belarus and Lithuania have built built border walls stretching for hundreds of kilometers. The countries have accused Belarus and its president, Alexander Lukashenko, of using migrants as a means of alternative warfare. Here's howForeign Affairssummed up the allegations in 2021, as huge masses of migrants surged from Belarus:

""[Belarus] enticed thousands of migrants and would-be asylum seekers, primarily Kurds from Iraq and Syria, as well as some Afghans, to his country with promises of easy access to the European Union.

Flown into the capital, Minsk, on special visas, they were bused to Belarus’s western border, where they were left in large, unprotected encampments as winter approached and temperatures plunged.""

In March,Human Rights Watchurged Poland to stop its practice of ""violent pushbacks"" against migrants, which the group says has led to 55 fatalities, including some children. Some die in the forest from exposure, starvation and lack of clean water.

From the archives,here's more video from previous border onslaughts:

2024-04-14 14:05:00,"'Not Looking For A Significant Escalation' - Israel Threatens Imminent Response To Iranian Attack, Then Walks It Back",https://web.archive.org/web/20240415085957/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/us-pressuring-china-turkey-saudi-arabia-intervene-iran-halt-attack-israel,"Iran sent 170 drones, 120 ballistic missiles and 30 cruise missiles - carrying a combined 60 tonnes of explosive material - into Israel

Iran violated Iraqi and Jordanian airpsace

Israel and its allies - including the US - shot down 99% of the Iranian munitions

The attack caused minor damage to Nevatim air base, in southern Israel, and one young girl from a Bedouin town in the south was hospitalized for severe shrapnel injuries

""We intercepted. We thwarted. Together we will win,""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted on X.

Israel and its allies reportedly viewed the event as a ""win.""

TheG7 condemned Iran's ""direct and unprecedented attack against Israel""and warning of an ""uncontrollable regional escalation.""

Iran threatened attacks on US bases in the MidEast if Washgton joins in any counter-offensive.

De-escalation- The Israeli war cabinet voted to ""exact a price from Iran in a manner and at a time that is right,"" but not immediately, according to US officials.

""We don't want to see this escalate,"" US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, adding that""we're not looking for a wider war with Iran.""

Update (1405ET):A flurry of geopol headlines just hit...

Let's begin with this report from Reuters.

ISRAEL SAID TO STRIKE BACK ON IRAN IN NEXT 24/48 HOURS

And this is from Israeli Channel 14.

🇮🇱-🇮🇷BREAKING- Israeli Channel 14 reports that#Israel's War Cabinet has decided to launch an attack on#Irantonight.pic.twitter.com/Jj3cBXCaY8

Moments after those headlines hit, there was a report from Yeshiva World News' Moshe Schwartz indicating:

""An immediate response with strikes within Iran was approved by a clear majority of the Israeli war cabinet but was called off at the last minute following Biden/Netanyahu phone call. The war cabinet still supports the planned response - but not necessarily immediately.""

Meanwhile, earlier, the US declared it would not participate in any counterattack against Iran.

""We don't seek a war with Iran. We're not looking for escalation here,"" White House national security spokesman John Kirby told NBC on Sunday.

Even earlier, President Biden discussed the evolving conflict between Iran-Israel in a meeting of the Group of Seven ""to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran's brazen attack.""

Iran told the US earlier today that if it supports Israel's counterattack,expect its military basesin the Middle East to be attacked with missiles and suicide drones.

In markets, Bitcoin instantly responded to the rollercoaster of headlines, initially down 3% but then surging to erase losses. Now moving lower.

To sum up, US officials say Israel 'isn't looking' for an escalation with Iran. Maybe Brent >$100/bbl is why...

Because Biden's handlers will allow a regional war to send oil to $150 six months before the election

And if there was any retaliation strike against Iran by Israel, the US would not be joining.

Update (0700ET): There are mounting concerns that Israel could strike back. If so,Iran warned Washington that US military bases could be in the crosshairs of missiles and suicide drones.

""Our response will be much larger than tonight's military action if Israel retaliates against Iran,"" Iran's armed forces chief of staff, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, told state media, as quoted byThe Times of Israel. He said that Tehran warned Washington that any backing of an Israeli retaliation strike would result in US bases being targeted.

""If the Zionist regime (Israel) or its supporters demonstrate reckless behavior, they will receive a decisive and much stronger response,"" Iran's president Ebrahim Raisi said in a statement.

Update(Midnight ET):It is just after 7am Israel local time and Israel's military is reporting the Iranian attack has stopped, several hours after Iran said its 'limited' operation has ""concluded"" - which involved an unprecedented hundreds of suicide drones as as well as ballistic missiles sent against Israel in retaliation for the April 1st Israeli attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus. Below is the top story from English-languageTimes of Israel:

Hebrew media reports claim thatnot a single drone or cruise missile managed to infiltrate Israeli airspace.

According to the unsourced reports,most ballistic missiles were also knocked down outside of Israeli airspace.

A report in Ynet says some 20 cruise missiles were downed short of Israel’s borders. The US, UK and Jordan helped take down many of the drones.

Israel is reporting very little damage inside the country (though previously admitting ""minor damage"" against at least one key airbase in the south).

After the enormous Iranian drone and missile swarm a senior Israeli official has been quoted by Israel's Channel 12 as saying""Iran’s attack was a strategic failure.""The official added in a threatening manner, ""Now they can get readyand not sleep in peace."" Israel's war cabinet appears to be readying a military response...

⚡️Hebrew Media: The Cabinet approves the implementation of a strong response on Iranian soil

Crucially, the Biden White House appears to be strongly signaling to the Netanyahu government that the attack is 'done' and that the United States will not back any follow-up counterattackoperations against Iran:

US President Joe Biden told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thatthe US will not aid any Israeli counterattack on Iran, US media report, citing senior administration officials.

Axios and CNN report that message was passed during a phone call between the pair.

Axios reports thatBiden told Netyanyahu the US will oppose any Israeli counterattack.

CNN reports that Biden saidthe US will not take part in any such counteraction.

Israel has called on a United Nations Security Council meeting to condemn the Iranian aggression, which is expected to take place late Sunday. The US administration appears to be lobbying for a status quo and for Israel to not mount a strong response.

Below is a portion of the Axios report on the Bibi-Bidenlate night phone call:

Behind the scenes:Biden told Netanyahu the joint defensive efforts by Israel, the U.S. and other countries in the regionled to the failure of the Iranian attack, according to the White House official.

Meanwhile, Israel's official channels are filled with 'fighting words' like the following:

Israelis’ reality in the last hours:pic.twitter.com/VXeHM8WqJi

Update(20:00ET):CNN is reporting there have beenseveral explosion on the ground across Israel, but there's yet to be official confirmation of the extent of casualties. Israeli media is reporting the firstas follows: ""Medics treating first injury from Iran attack –a 10-year-old boyfrom Bedouin town near Arad in serious condition."" The IDF spokesman is confirmingat least one of its military bases has been hit in the south by an Iranian cruise missile, sustaining ""minor damage"". This was reportedly at Dimona, where Israel reportedly has undeclared nuclear weapons, making such a strike highly dangerous. Further Iran's IRNA is reporting:

Iran successfully struck the Israeli airbase in the Negev Desert with 'Khaybar' ballistic missiles.

Importantly,Times of Israelis reporting that Israel's military is preparing a response, in what is likely to become a continuing tit-for-tat in the coming days:

Israel plans a “significant response” to the unprecedented Iranian drone salvoagainst it, top-rated Channel 12 TV quotes an unnamed senior Israeli official as saying early on Sunday."
2024-04-14 16:12:00,One Bank [Finally] Says Quiet Part Out Loud On Gold Manipulation,https://web.archive.org/web/20240415085957/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-14/one-bank-finally-says-quiet-part-gold-manipulation-out-loud,"Authored byGoldFixZH Edit

In this week’s Greed & Fear report Chris Wood devotes a significant portion of his analysis to all things Gold before moving on to his regular work.

Jefferies is a respected global capital-market firm, and while Chris Wood is knowledgeable and writes on many markets, (with Asia as a specialty), most of his published macro work focuses data and equity drivers. We’ve read him for years when we got his stuff.He is an elder statesman of macro2and also one we wished had picked up on manipulation of precious metals markets earlier as readers.  He’s no newbie or Youtube rabble-rouser

But  someone (finally) says the quiet part out loud. Other banks have also recently intimated government manipulation if you know where to look. Here, Wood stops just short of directly accusing the Government of manipulating Gold pricescalling it “the biggest risk” of this rally now.

It was also Chris who recently vindicated us confirming he heardChina bought Oil and paid Russia with Gold last year. Anyway.. he does the work, knows his history and pleasant to read.What's more, for an experienced macro analyst such as Chris to say these things out loud when he and his brethren may have suspected them for years begs the question:“Why now?But that is for another time.

Anyway, know you were right, and the gaslighting by banks is slowly ending because it is no longer profitable for them to gaslight you on government behalf. But don't call it manipulation

Authored by Christopher Wood, Global Head of Equity Strategy at Jefferies[emphasis and subtitles ours]

""[O]bvious temptation on the part of a major central bank to seek to try to manage the gold price.“

An old contact told GREED & fear this week of something GREED & fear was not aware of. That is that former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker once said that the one mistake he had made in the late 1970s was not stopping the price of gold from rising as much it didin that period when the American central bank was engaged in fighting inflation. Back then gold rose from US$220/oz in January 1979 to a peak of US$850/oz in January 1980.

This was during the period when the Volcker Fed raised the federal funds rate from 10% in early 1979 to a peak of 20% in March 1980 (see Exhibit 1). US CPI inflation peaked at 14.8% YoY in March 1980 while the ten-year Treasury bond yield peaked at 15.8% in September 1981 (see Exhibit 2).

Volcker’s observation, if true since GREED & fear can find no documented evidence of it,is interesting given the obvious temptation on the part of a major central bank to seek to try to manage the gold price.[GoldFix- how can an “obvious temptation” be discovered all of a sudden?]

On that point, Comex trading records showed that at3pm New York time last Thursday there was a US$1.6bn sale of gold futures in about three minutes which temporarily knocked the bullion spot price from US$2,306/oz to US$2,268/oz before it rebounded to US$2,330/oz on Friday(see Exhibit 3).

GREED & fear has no idea of who or what was behind such a tradesave to note thata soaring gold price is not in the interest of the relevant authoritiesany more than a surging oil price is.

Gold is up by 29% since early October and by 18% since midFebruary, while the Brent crude oil price is up by 25% since mid-December (see Exhibit 4)

Meanwhile if the causes of the rally in the oil price are reasonably self-evident, not least of which are the supply constraints enforced by Opec Plus,the near-term drivers of the current gold rally are much less clear even to a long-term gold bull like GREED & fear.For now at least there continues to be a notable lack of inflows into gold ETFs in the Western world. Rather the reverse is the case. Gold ETFs’ holdings have declined by 120 tonnes year to date to 2,542 tonnes as of Wednesday following a decline of 254 tonnes in 2023, according to Bloomberg (see Exhibit 5).

It is also the case that GREED & fear heard this week that the physical premium on gold bars and coins traded in Singapore are at only a normal 1-2% compared with the 7-8% levels seen at the peak of the last bull market in 2011 and 2012.

There is alsono evidence of a sudden pickup in sales of American Eagle Bullion coins,one of the most popular series in the US. Indeed American Eagle gold bullion coin sales declined from 19,500oz in February to 12,000 oz in March, the lowest level for the month of March since 2019.

2024-04-14 17:30:00,Judge Upholds Georgia's Voter Citizenship Verification Requirements,https://web.archive.org/web/20240415085957/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/judge-upholds-georgias-voter-citizenship-verification-requirements,"Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

A federal judge has dismissed a legal challenge to Georgia’s voter citizenship verification requirements, keeping in place the state’s process of cross-checking citizenship status to determine voter eligibility and handing a win to election integrity advocates.

Judge Eleanor Ross of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgiaissued a rulingon April 11 that dismisses alawsuitbrought by a coalition of advocacy groups nearly six years ago that claimed Georgia’s voter citizenship verification requirements unfairly discriminated against naturalized citizens, who are more likely to be people of color.

Following a three-day trial, the judge ruled that all four of the plaintiffs’ claims—including that the protocols violated multiple federal laws, the U.S. Constitution, and unfairly burdened the right to vote—are dismissed.

In so doing, the judge sided with amotion for summary judgmentmade in 2021 by the defendant, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who argued that the state’s protocols for matching naturalized citizens’ voter registrations with the state’s citizenship records were “entirely reasonable” and placed a “minimum burden” on applicants.

Mr. Raffensperger argued that, in almost every case, the requirement was fulfilled by matching driver’s licence or state identification numbers submitted for voter registration with corresponding records at the Georgia Department of Driver Services (DDS) to confirm citizenship status.

When a naturalized citizen registers to vote in Georgia, their county registrar verifies proof of citizenship using DDS data. If that voter’s citizenship cannot be verified through that database, the onus is on the voter to submit proof of citizenship within 26 months or their voter registration application will be canceled.

The plaintiffs have alleged that DDS data is often outdated, leading many naturalized citizens’ voter registrations to be flagged and canceled unfairly.

Mr. Raffensperger disputed the claim that this issue affected many people, arguing in his motion that “any arguable burden on this small group of people to demonstrate they are now citizens is minimal and does not go beyond the ‘usual burdens of voting’ because it can be resolved as simply as showing the same photo identification that every Georgia voter is required to show in order to vote in person in Georgia.”

He also argued that the citizenship process serves a “compelling interest” in ensuring that only eligible voters are allowed to cast a vote, an argument raised by election integrity advocates across the country amid various disputes over voting rules.

The plaintiffs sued Mr. Raffensperger in 2018, arguing that the state’s protocols for matching naturalized citizens’ voter registrations with the state’s citizenship records violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.

They also claimed that these protocols put an unfair burden on the right to vote, in violation of 1st and 14th Amendment protections, while also claiming that the requirements ran counter to the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) by delaying or denying qualified voters from registering to cast ballots.

The coalition of groups asked the court to rule that the citizenship matching protocols were illegal, and to permanently block their enforcement.

The case eventually went to trial on April 8, 2024, leading to a favorable ruling for Mr. Raffensperger and delivering a win to election integrity advocates more generally.

“Ensuring that only U.S. citizens vote in our elections is critically important to secure and accurate elections,” Mr. Raffensperger said in a statement praising the ruling.

“Georgia’s citizenship verification process is common sense and it works. With this ruling, we are able to continue ensuring that only U.S. citizens are voting in our elections,” he added.

Aunna Dennis, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, one of the plaintiffs, told The Epoch Times in an emailed statement that the ruling is disappointing as it keeps in place obstacles to casting a vote.

“This is disappointing becauseit will potentially disenfranchise citizen voters who now have to jump through multiple bureaucratic hurdles to vote,” Ms. Dennis said. “It will also create shock waves that may chill other new voters from trying to vote, even when they are eligible.”

“Sadly, Georgia’s lawful voters will bear the brunt of anti-immigrant sentiments,” she added.

The ruling comes amid concern in some circles that noncitizens—including some of the many millions of illegal immigrants who have entered the United States since President Joe Biden took office—may cast votes unlawfully in the high-stakes 2024 election.

It also comes amid a broader fight between those who see election integrity efforts as “voter suppression” and those who believe that the security of U.S. elections is too lax and should be tightened.

According to a running tally by the left-leaningBrennan Center for Justice, expansive voting laws far outpaced restrictive ones in 2023.

At least 53 expansive voting laws were introduced last year in at least 23 states, compared to 17 restrictive laws being passed in 14 states, suggesting that the election integrity movement is falling behind.

Amid concerns over voter fraud, former House Speaker Newt Gingrichrecently suggestedthat to win the presidential election in November, Republicans need to outvote Democrats by a significant margin.

“Everybody who wants an honest election should know that in the long run, we need the French model. Everybody votes on the same day. Everybody has a photo ID, everybody’s accounted as a person,” Mr. Gingrich said in a February interview on Fox News.

“But until we get to that, if Republicans want to win this year, under the rules that exist this year, they need to outvote the Democrats by about 5 percent, which is a margin big enough that it can’t be stolen,” he said.

Elsewhere, an election integrity monitorlaid outover a dozen “critical” reforms that it believes are necessary in order to secure voter integrity in the 2024 election, including outlawing ranked choice voting and non-citizen voting, consolidating election dates, requiring voter ID, and safeguarding vulnerable mail ballots.

The Iranian attack on Israel appeared as an iPhone price alert well before any news service would run the story. That’s how markets work. Crypto is the only liquid asset class that trades on Saturday,so those of us who never really turn off learned something big happened right around 3:45pm ET on Saturday(ZH:which is precisely when we noticed this first...).

Only market that's openpic.twitter.com/ln0VkouuYs

Bitcoin dumped from $67,000 to $61,750 in a matter of minutes. Had the S&P 500 been open, it would’ve gapped lower by 3.0% give or take, in my estimation. Probably not enough to seriously stress the stop-loss mechanisms at all those grossly overleveraged multi-manager pod shops,but a reminder that markets are continuous until they are not.

And anyway, by the time of the S&P futures market open on Sunday night at 6pm ET, and then the liquid cash market open at 9:30am ET Monday, we’ll know a lot more, and prices will reflect the new information.

The Iranian regime posted this on X at 6:06pm ET, well after it initiated hostilities:

Conducted on the strength of Article 51 of the UN Charter pertaining to legitimate defense, Iran’s military action was in response to the Zionist regime’s aggression against our diplomatic premises in Damascus. The matter can be deemed concluded. However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe. It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!

Conducted on the strength of Article 51 of the UN Charter pertaining to legitimate defense, Iran’s military action was in response to the Zionist regime’s aggression against our diplomatic premises in Damascus. The matter can be deemed concluded. However, should the Israeli…

Crypto traders appeared to take some comfort in the Iranian sentence: “The matter can be deemed concluded.”Bitcoin prices bounced off the bottom. And while Israeli sources indicated they intercepted 99% of the incoming drones and missiles, they also suggested the Iranian attack requires a decisive response.

G7 countries planned a call for Sunday to coordinate a response. Biden pledged to stand by Israel. The US Navy sent an amphibious warship to the Eastern Mediterranean with 2,500 young Marines.

And those of us, many thousands of miles from the region, prayed that we restore a semblance of balance, stability, peace, through greater internal political cooperation at home, principled diplomacy abroad, and overwhelming economic and military strength.

2024-04-14 19:15:00,Whistleblowers To Further Dismantle Jan. 6 National Guard Narrative About Trump,https://web.archive.org/web/20240415085957/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/whistleblowers-further-dismantle-jan-6-national-guard-narrative-about-trump,"On Wednesday, whistleblowers from the Washington DC National Guard are expected to tell Congressional investigators thatformer President Donald Trumpwanted them deployed,but an Army Secretary, Ryan McCarthy, delayed relaying this to DC National Guard Commander William Walkerby at leasttwo hours.

According to theDaily Mail, at leastthree whistleblowerswill also testify that their stories were ignored by the Democrat-led January 6 committee because it didn't fit their narrative. The hearing will aim to further prove that Acting SecDef Christopher Millerdidgive advance approval to deploy the National Guard at Trump's command.

Instead of getting to the bottom of the breakdown in communication and focusing on improving Military preparedness for future incidents,the witnesses feel the January 6 panel was solely focused on pinning blame for the events that day on Trump.

The officers, who were with Walker the day of the Capitol riot, will detail howthey were on buses in full tactical gear for hourswaiting for the go-ahead from the Army.

McCarthy has stated under oath that he did give a timely order for deployment of the D.C. National Guard – butWalker's troops said they found out about mobilization during a press conference, which led to athree-hour-and-19-minute delayof forces arriving at the Capitol. -Daily Mail

Some have suggested that McCarthy was trying to intervene over the optics of the Army, under his command, trying to inhibit or interfere with certification of the 2020 presidential election results - and that he may have been vying for a spot in the incoming Biden administration.

The hearing on Wednesday, ""Three Years Later: D.C. National Guard Whistleblowers Speak Out on January 6 Delay,""will explore whether Trump was at fault for the delay in deploying the National Guard.

Last month, Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA), chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee reviewing the J6 investigation into the Capitol riot, released anever-before-seen transcriptwith Trump's J6 security chief Tony Ornato, during which he testifies thatTrump did in fact authorize the National Guard to be mobilized to DC that day- which completely shredded the J6 committee's argument that Trump simply wanted to stoke chaos that day.

Meanwhile, both Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund and DC National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Walker have testified that Army Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt (ret.)delayed or ignored Sund's request for National Guard support- claiming that Piatt said ""I don't like the visual of the National Guard standing a police line with the Capitol in the background.""

On Wednesday, the whistleblowers will be able to corroborate these claims.

Q1. What are the key factors driving any potential reaction in oil prices to the events over the weekend?

The medium-run fundamental impact of geopolitical developments on oil prices ultimatelydepends on the effect they have on oil supply, oil demand, and oil inventories,inclusive of OPEC’s supply policy response. Because OPEC spare capacity is elevated, we still see geopolitical impediments to OPEC’s ability and/or desire to deploy spare capacity as the key upside risk to oil prices.

2024-04-14 21:00:00,"19 Retired Generals, Admirals File Supreme Court Brief Against Trump Immunity Bid",https://web.archive.org/web/20240415085957/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/19-retired-generals-admirals-file-supreme-court-brief-against-trump-immunity-bid,"Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

More than a dozen former Defense Department officials, generals, and admirals filed a brief with the Supreme Court arguing against former President Donald Trump’s presidential immunity arguments.

It comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the former president’s assertions that he should enjoy immunity from prosecution for activity that he carried out while he was president. The former president invoked that argument after he was accused by federal prosecutors of attempting to illegally overturn the 2020 election results.

Theamicus brief’s signatoriesincludeformer CIA Director Michael Hayden, retired Admiral Thad Allen, retired Gen. George Casey, retired Gen. Charles Krulak,and more.

They claimed that granting President Trump immunity against criminal claims could lead to activity that put U.S. national security at risk.

“The notion of such immunity, both as a general matter, and also specifically in the context of the potential negation of election results, threatens to jeopardize our nation’s security and international leadership,” their brief stated. “Particularly in times like the present, when anti-democratic, authoritarian regimes are on the rise worldwide, such a threat is intolerable and dangerous.”

The arguments submitted by President Trump will “risk jeopardizing America’s standing as a guardian of democracy in the world and further feeding the spread of authoritarianism, thereby threatening the national security of the United States and democracies around the world,” the group added.

The former secretary of Defense under President Trump, Mark Esper, was critical of their submission to the Supreme Court, arguing during a CNN interview that he “would prefer to see retired admirals and generals not get involved.”

But PresidentTrump’s lawyers have contended that the president’s office cannot function without immunity from the threat of prosecutionbecause it could “incapacitate every future president with de facto blackmail and extortion while in office and condemn him to years of post-office trauma at the hands of political opponents,” arguing that such a phenomenon is playing out right now after the former president was indicted multiple times last year.

The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had earlier issued a ruling against President Trump’s arguments that he should be declared immune from prosecution. The appeals process, meanwhile, has put on hold the former president’s trial in Washington.

“A denial of criminal immunity would incapacitate every future president with de facto blackmail and extortion while in office, and condemn him to years of post-office trauma at the hands of political opponents. The threat of future prosecution and imprisonment would become a political cudgel to influence the most sensitive and controversial presidential decisions, taking away the strength, authority and decisiveness of the presidency,”accordingto President Trump’s filing issued last month.

The former president last October sought to have the charges dismissed based on his claim of immunity. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected those arguments in December.

“Even if some level of Presidential malfeasance, not present in this case at all, were to escape punishment, that risk is inherent in the Constitution’s design,” President Trump’s attorneys also wrote to the high court.

“The Founders viewed protecting the independence of the Presidency as well worth the risk that some Presidents might evade punishment in marginal cases,“ they said, adding that the Founding Fathers were ”unwilling to burn the Presidency itself to the ground to get at every single alleged malefactor.”

Special counsel Jack Smith has pushed for the U.S. high court to reject the former president’s claims of immunity, telling the justices that President Trump’s actions that led to the charges, if he is convicted, would represent “an unprecedented assault on the structure of our government.”

“The effective functioning of the presidency does not require that a former president be immune from accountability for these alleged violations of federal criminal law,” Mr. Smith wrote this week. “To the contrary, a bedrock principle of our constitutional order is that no person is above the law including the president.”

The signatories to the amicus brief include retired Army Gens. George Casey and Peter Chiarelli, retired Air Force Gens. John Jumper, Craig McKinley, and Charles Wald; retired Marine Corps Gens. Carlton Fulford, Charles Krulak, and Robert Magnus; retired Navy Admirals Steve Abbot, Samuel Jones Locklear, John Nathman, Bill Owens, and Scott Swift; and retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen.

Several former civilian Pentagon officials signed onto the brief. They include former Army Secretary Louis Caldera, former Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James, Navy Secretary Sean O’Keefe, and Navy Secretary Ray Mabus.

Backing President Trump, several GOP-led states filed apetitionto the Supreme Court arguing that the justices should reverse the appeals court’s decision and grant the former president immunity in the cases.

Obviously Israel didn’t clock a 100% interception rate last night, but it’s important to let them claim that they did. This is the off-ramp to reset the escalation cycle.https://t.co/plM3wK7Aoq

One well-placed observer disagreed with that assessment, former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. That name may sound familiar to Zero Hedge readers: Bennett tried to mediate an end to the Ukraine War shortly after it began, andlater claimedthat the West sabotaged a peace agreement that Russia and the Ukraine were ready to sign. Bennett took to X on Sunday to share his views on the Israel-Iran conflict.

Renato Moicano's televised speech came after he pulled off a comeback win over Jalin Turner at Las Vegas. Joe Rogan joined him in the ring to discuss the fight, but Moicano had other priorities, andproceeded to drop a profanity-peppered liberty bombon the T-Mobile Arena crowd and a worldwide audience:

“I’m a huge advocate of the First Amendment. Today, of course I want the $300k bonus but they not going to give [it to me] because somebody say,'hey, this is fucking Disney, you cannot curse'…so I’m not going to do my speech, but...

First off all I love America. I love the Constitution. I love the First Amendment. I want to carry all the fucking guns. I love private property. And let me tell you something:If you care about your fucking country, read Ludwig von Mises and the six lessons of the Austrian economic school, motherfuckers!”

Renato “Money” Moicano uses his post fight speech to shout out the 1st Amendment & Ludwig von Mises#UFC300pic.twitter.com/NlgHcV8Z1J

By ""six lessons of the Austrian economic school,""Moicano was referring to a concise, 106-page Ludwig von Mises book,""Economic Policy: Thoughts for Today and Tomorrow.""Among the best-selling Mises works, it's broken into six sections: Capitalism, Socialism, Interventionism, Inflation, Foreign Investment, and Policies and Ideas. (The Brazilian version's title translates to ""The Six Lessons."")

The lessons are transcribedfrom a series of lectures Mises delivered at the University of Buenos Airesin 1959. Per the book'sdescription, ""Mises had urged Argentina to turn from dictatorship and socialism toward full liberty, so there is a special urgency behind the cool logic employed here. The book's continued popularity is due to its clarity of exposition on the ways in which economic policy affects everyone.""

Eager to follow Moicano's directive? Via theMises Institute, you can read the bookonline, download a PDF forfree, or buy a paper copy from theMises Bookstorefor just eight Federal Reserve notes. It's likely that plenty of people are already buried in their homework: On Saturday night,UFC fans and others dove into web searches to see what Moicano was talking about...

...whilelibertarians and Austrian economics devotees raced to share Moicano's speech on social media:

Introspection was the last thing on NPR's mind, however, as newCEO Katherine Maher chastised Berliner as ""profoundly disrespectful, hateful, and demeaning""to his colleagues for calling out political bias.

AsJonathan Turleynotes:

In a memo Friday, Maher told the staff that Berliner attacked not only “the quality of our editorial process and the integrity of our journalists” but“our people on the basis of who we are.”

Maher’s response was hardly surprising.She was a controversial hire at NPR. Many had hoped that NPR would seek a CEO who could steer the company away from its partisan and activistic trend.The prospect could have brought moderates and conservatives back into NPR’s listening audience.Maher, however, was part of that trend.

This should come as no surprise givenMaher's history as a complete lunaticwho spews woke diatribes on X - calling herself ""someone with cis white mobility privilege"" and other nonsense.

In response to journalist Chris Rufo pointing this out, Elon Musk replied that she's a ""crazy racist!""

This person is a crazy racist!

Maher also says that ""America is addicted to white supremacy,"" which is the ""real issue.""

New NPR CEO seems to have many symptoms of the Cluster B Longhouse psychopathology. Antagonistic, performative, accusatory, & frankly delusional. Pronouns in bio. Unstable.https://t.co/YioG8rjB9K

She alsoexcused looters, and even slammed Hillary Clinton for correctly gendering individuals.

2024-04-14 22:55:00,Bread And Circuses: What It Means For Once-Great Nations,https://web.archive.org/web/20240415085957/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/bread-and-circuses-what-it-means-once-great-nations,"Authored by Nicole James via The Epoch Times,

Democracy, that ever-so-fleeting fancy, has a tendency to tumble into a bit of a tizz before it topples over, panting and gasping like a winded walrus.

John Adams, ever the prophet of doom, once quipped,“Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself”—a sentiment echoing through the corridors of time.

And sounding much like the belch of a senator post-banquet in ancient Rome, where democracy was more a concept for philosophical banter than a practice.

Indeed, Rome, with all its pomp and voracious appetite for self-indulgence, serves as a cautionary tale. It’s a well-trodden path.

Once upon a time in Rome, there was Juvenal. Not your garden-variety naysayer, but a man whose tongue was so sharp, he could slice the moral fabric of society with a mere quip.

“Bread and circuses,”he scoffed.

“Keep the masses stuffed and entertained, and they won’t utter a peep against you.”

And so, Rome bloated, not just in the midriff but in its sense of self, as leisure became the national pastime.

Back then, over 200,000 souls, their fingers sticky from pastry, found the concept of lifting a finger (unless it was to signal for another helping) utterly foreign.

Rome was transformed into a grand stage, where almost every day was a festival, and the citizens were either performers, spectators, or busy in the vomitorium making room for the next course.

Naval skirmishes in makeshift lakes, chariot races that put the fast and furious to shame, and theatre so risqué it could make a statue of Venus look prudish, were all funded by the very people it was designed to distract.

Ninety-three days of sheer, unadulterated spectacle each year, turning Rome from a republic into an extravagant production, where democracy was but a whisper drowned out by the roar of the crowd.

As the mighty arm of the empire began to resemble less of a fearsome gladiator and more of a feeble old man waving a stick at rambunctious youths, the calendar started to look like a mushroom farm after a spring shower, each new holiday popping up to toast to victories most had forgotten the taste of.

Seems positively contemporary, what with the world running out of calendar days and having to celebrate Easter Sunday on Trans Awareness Day, an event that surely had the ancients rolling in their extravagantly decorated sarcophagi, perplexed by the modern conundrum of “calendar overcrowding.”

Emperors, those illustrious leaders of men, were reduced to headline acts in this comedic opera, plastering on smiles and feigning a zeal for the games that could rival a wet sponge’s enthusiasm for a desert trek.

In this farce, the once hallowed ceremonies now resembled a confused shuffle of days, where the only thing more bewildering than the holidays themselves was the populace’s ability to keep track of what they were celebrating.

Gone were the days of the iron-fisted rule of Julius Caesar or the cunning Augustus. Now, the sceptre was in the shaky grasp of the likes of Commodus and Septimius Severus, whose reigns were as inspiring as a flat ale on a hot day.

Leadership, once a robust wine, had become a watery vinegar, with emperors inflating their egos and coffers, whipping up the populace into a frenzy with what amounted to little more than patriotic chest-beating and flag-waving.

The spectacles, meanwhile, morphed into a grotesque parade of the bizarre and the barbaric, a stark contrast to the fading reality of employment and land ownership—those became the stuff of fairy tales.

Even the steadfast Marcus Aurelius watched helplessly as the empire’s coinage became as flimsy as modern promises of fiscal restraint, shrinking in both size and worth.

Leap forward to the present, and the circus hasn’t so much as ended as it has swapped costumes.

Today’s coliseum is filled with Drag Time Story Hours and a calendar so crammed with celebrations of every stripe of pride and culture that one might need a guide to navigate it.

Subsidies shower down like the finale of a firework show, ensuring the populace remains too stuffed on the bread and dazzled by the circus of reality TV outrages and viral sensations to notice the ground shifting beneath their feet.

In this grand festival of the now, one has to wonder if we’ve become spectators in our own version of Rome’s downfall, squinting at the bright lights, too entertained to notice we’re perched on the edge of history’s greatest pratfall.

Will the grand banquet of our times end in a burp of regret?

2024-04-15 02:00:00,Why Mankind Remains So Lost In Economic-Ignorance & Tribalistic-Warmongering,https://web.archive.org/web/20240415085957/https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/why-mankind-remains-so-lost-economic-ignorance-triablistic-warmongering,"Authored by Jorge Besada via The Mises Institute,

Carl Menger is widely recognized as one of the economists leading the so-called marginalist revolution along with William Stanley Jevons and Léon Walras.There are two other contributions by Menger that are relatively underappreciated and are vital for making sense of the socioeconomic order, including why mankind remains so lost in economic ignorance and tribalistic warmongering.

They are, first,his insights into the proper method or way to study the economy or social order and its emergence-evolution, and second, hisapplication of such wisdom to explain the evolution of money and the entire socioeconomic orderthat further emerges thanks to money. Let’s further expand on these two.

Menger wrote an entirebookdevoted to discussing the proper method with which to study the social sciences, aptly titledInvestigations into the Methods of the Social Sciences. So how should we study the social sciences according to Menger? Hewrites,

Natural organisms almost without exception exhibit, when closely observed, a really admirable functionality of all parts with respect to the whole, a functionality which is not, however, the result of human calculation, but of a natural process. Similarly we can observe in numerous social institutions a strikingly apparent functionality with respect to the whole. But with closer consideration they still do not prove to be the result of an intention aimed at this purpose, Le., the result of an agreement of members of society or of positive legislation. They, too, present themselves to us rather as “natural” products (in a certain sense), as unintended results of historical development. One needs, e.g., only to think of the phenomenon of money, an institution which to so great a measure serves the welfare of society, and yet in most nations, by far, is by no means the result of an agreement directed at its establishment as a social institution, or of positive legislation, but is the unintended product of historical development. One needs only to think of law, of language, of the origin of markets, the origin of communities and of states, etc.Now if social phenomena and natural organisms exhibit analogies with respect to their nature, their origin, and their function, it is at once clear that this fact cannot remain without influence on the method of research in the field of the social sciences in general and economics in particular.. . . Now if state, society, economy, etc., are conceived of as organisms, or as structures analogous to them, the notion of following directions of research in the realm of social phenomena similar to those followed in the realm of organic nature readily suggests itself. The above analogy leads to the idea of theoretical social sciences analogous to those which are the result of theoretical research in the realm of the physico-organic world, to the conception of an anatomy and physiology of “social organisms” of state, society, economy, etc.

Like Herbert Spencer, his contemporary and arguably the most famous and influential intellectual of the late 1800s,Menger too felt like the social order wasakinto a “social organism” and should be studied using an organic or evolutionary approach similar to how we study the biological order.Menger thus felt like the methods of the physical sciences, like their use of mathematics, was as inappropriate for understanding the monumental complexity and evolution of the social order as it was for the biological one.

Hewrites,“I do not belong to the believers in the mathematical method as a way to deal with our science. . . . Mathematics is not a method for . . . economic research.”

Ludwig von Mises and F.A. Hayek would of course follow suit. Miseswrote, “As a method of economic analysis econometrics is a childish play with figures that does not contribute anything to the elucidation of the problems of economic reality.”

Hayek alsoridiculesthe “extensive use of mathematics, which must always impress politicians lacking any mathematical education, and which is really the nearest thing to the practice of magic that occurs among professional economists.”

The following analogy helps us further understand Menger’s vital insights.

Just like the human body organism and the numerous “systems” that coordinate it—like the respiratory-nervous-digestive systems—are the result of the actions of some seventy trillion human and bacterial cells but obviously NOT the result of any conscious planning or designing by them. And thanks to the likes of Darwin and a modern understanding of genetics, we can hypothesize how natural selection was the inadvertent “designer” of such systems and complex order. The modern global socioeconomic order—“social organism”—is also coordinated by a system, by what Menger’s intellectual descendants like Ludwig von Mises and his great protégé 1974 Nobel laureate in economics F.A. Hayek referred to as “the market process.”The market process is composed of “parts” like money, prices, economic competition, interest rates, and the legal-religious-governmental frameworks that sustain it. However, the result of the actions of men “do not prove to be the result of an intention aimed at this purpose . . . but is the unintended product of historical development,” similar to how cells inadvertently and unconsciously acted to create the systems that coordinate multicellular life.

The above mindset or “method” allowed Menger to then make what is arguably the most important insight, or what I like to call the “flux-capacitor” idea, of the social sciences: Menger’s explanation of the evolution of money and its numerous ramifications. Consider the following:from the tradition of private property emerges the freedom to trade it with anyone in the entire planet which inadvertently transforms mankind into a global supercomputer where people via the private companies they create are motivated to innovate and learn from each other (competitors), thus inadvertently cooperating to discover and spread superior information and subsequent order throughout the world.

Money is what enables this civilization-creating mechanism.Every social-order entity, whether a person or a company, is in a constant cycle of the production and consumption of wealth. A business’s sales revenue or a worker’s paycheck is an estimate of how much wealth was produced, and costs are an estimate of how much wealth was consumed while production took place. If there is more production (sales revenue) than consumption (costs), then the order is profitable and has thus increased the economic pie of wealth.

Money is what allows the profit-loss calculation that allows billions of people and companies to order their actions in a profitable and thus pie-order-increasing manner.Also, without money, how would a heart surgeon trade his services for a toothpick?Everything mentioned above that plays a vital role in creating civilization or “the social organism” ultimately depends on and emerges from the use of money. Economics students quickly learn how money is what overcomes the “double coincidence of wants” problem that allows trade and its vital benefits like the ever-expanding division of labor and information to arise.

Without money there is no complex division of labor or information above the levels of small tribes, and thus no large-scale civilization or “social organism.”Menger’s vital insight regarding money is that he showed how money, just like language, was an evolved and NOT designed innovation. Since money was an evolved and NOT designed innovation, this also means that all the other vital mechanisms that, taken together, make up the market process like profit-loss calculation and economic competition, they too are largely evolved/undesigned mechanisms.

This is the key to understanding how we live in this massively complex world, with a rapidly expanding and intensifying division of labor and information that creates mind-bogglingly complex microchips, the internet, etc.Yet the masses and their politicians remain economically ignorant, segregating themselves into us versus them, using the technology to fight deadlier wars, and ignorantly attempting to centrally plan the social-order economy,which inadvertently destroys the evolved and undesigned economic competition which is what really creates and spreads the information that creates civilization.

The above insights and more associated with Menger’s Austrian School of Economics, as Hayek tells us, “belong fully and wholly to Carl Menger.” Hayek againsaid,“There must be few instances . . . where the works of an author who revolutionized the body of an already well-developed science and who has been generally recognized to have done so, have remained so little known as those of Carl Menger.”

Yes! And we are running out of time to catch up to Menger. It took a while for the vital myth-shattering ideas of Galileo, Bruno, and Copernicus to spread. We find ourselves in a similar situation.

Whether homo sapiens ultimately self-destroy in another tribalistic world war, socialist revolution, environmental disaster, or covid-mania, self-mutilating economic lockdown, it will all come down to whether Menger’s ideas reach people of influence in time.

2024-04-15 13:18:49,Some thoughts on the cowardice of America’s leadership,https://web.archive.org/web/20240416123035/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-15/some-thoughts-cowardice-americas-leadership,"by James Hickman via Schiff Sovereign

When the barbarian king Rugila died in the year 434 AD, Roman Emperor Theodosius II likely rejoiced that his mortal enemy was no more.

Rugila (and his father Uldin) had been invading and terrorizing Roman territory for decades; but the Empire was so weak at that point that Theodosius was powerless to stop them.

By the early 400s, Rome was an almost unrecognizable shell of its former greatness. Nearly two centuries civil war, plague, inflation, invasion, and economic malaise had sapped the empire of its strength and reputation… and foreign kingdoms didn’t hesitate to take advantage.

In the early 420s, Theodosius finally resorted to paying off King Rugila, essentially bribing him with an offer of 350 pounds of gold ANNUALLY.

Rugila took the money… probably bewildered at how easily he was able to bend the supposedly powerful Roman Empire to his will.

Theodosius subserviently made the payments year after year, and managed to pretend that the deal was a win for Rome.

The Emperor acted as if he was still powerful and in charge of the situation. He even tried to convince his subjects that the annual tribute was payment for some bogus service that the barbarians were supposedly providing, rather than the ransom money it really was.

And that’s why King Rugila’s death was probably such welcome news to the Emperor. Finally, the menace was gone.

But unfortunately for Theodosius, Rugila’s successor would prove to be a far greater threat.

His name was Attila, known to history of course as Attila the Hun. And he wasted no time picking up where his father and grandfather left off: capitalizing on the Roman leadership’s weakness and cowardice.

Attila’s first order of business was to renegotiate the peace deal and make even more demands of the Roman Empire. Theodosius caved almost immediately.

It became known as the Treaty of Margus; Attila walked away with DOUBLE the annual tribute (an increase from 350 to 700 pounds of gold). Plus, he forced the Emperor to eliminate trade sanctions against the Huns and open up Rome’s vast markets to Hun merchants.

Lastly, Attila negotiated a prisoner swap, receiving some very high value Hun nobles who had taken refuge in the Roman Empire. In exchange, Theodosius received a few low-level soldiers… and the Emperor had to pay an additional ransom for each one of them.

Like his father Rugila, Attila was probably astonished that the ruler of the supposedly most powerful empire in the world had no backbone, no confidence, no will to stand and fight.

So naturally Attila’s demands did not end with the Treaty of Margus. He knew an obvious advantage when he saw one, and he continued to exploit Roman weakness until the end of his life.

Despite promises of peace, for example, Attila constantly found new excuses to set aside the treaty and make incursions into Roman territory.

He crossed the Danube and laid waste to Rome’s provinces in the Balkans, forcing Theodosius to renegotiate the peace treaty once again. This time the annual tribute was tripled to 2,100 pounds of gold.

A few years later, Attila demanded to marry the sister of Valentinian, the ruler of the western portion of the Roman Empire. Valentinian refused the proposal (as well as Attila’s demand for half of the western lands), so Attila invaded Italy, plundering and pillaging along the way.

Attila finally died in 453 AD before he had the chance to completely destroy the empire. But other barbarian kings also saw the ineptitude and weakness of Roman leadership, and they followed in Attila’s footsteps.

That’s the thing about cowardice and weakness: adversaries tend to notice and take advantage. It’s no different today.

Iran, Russia, and China have all paid close attention to the weakness and cowardice of the Biden administration. They see the social and financial decay of the United States. The political instability. The woke priorities of the Defense Department. And they can barely believe their eyes.

They know that the guy with five decades of experience has no backbone… that he’s a corrupt, brainless stooge who bends to the most radical wing of his party. He stands for nothing, abandons his allies, and gives away the farm for absolutely nothing in return.

He traded away the most valuable Russian prisoner in US custody for a WNBA player. He freed up potentially tens of billions of dollars for Iran in exchange for little more than a phony promise that they won’t develop nuclear weapons. (But it seems the Ayatollah pinky swore, so it’s all good.)

He allows invasions and incursions of US territory… and not only does nothing but sues state governments to prevent them from securing the border.

He tries to prevent allies from defending themselves. He pathetically attempts to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to boost his sagging approval rating. And he caves anytime a belligerent nation threatens violence.

These are all signs of obvious weakness that adversaries are all too happy to exploit. Iran is just the most recent example.

After this weekend’s attack against Israel, Iran specifically warned the US against responding. Biden immediately wilted. It’s pretty clear who wears the pants in the relationship.

And just like the case of Attila, it never ends. Any treaty that is signed, any agreement that is reached, is simply a lie. They’ll never keep their word, and they’ll continue milking the obvious cowardice that is on display for the world to see.

Now, this story of weakness isn’t just about Joe Biden.  Congress is also weak and ineffective. Many courts and judges now ignore the rule of law and are simply activists in robes. The military is suffering a very public recruiting crisis, along with outdated weapons systems and critically low mission readiness.

It goes beyond government too. Big Media is a left-wing propaganda machine. Premier universities cultivate radicalism. Even Boeing can’t seem to build a quality aircraft anymore.

Optics matter, and the end result is undeniable: America appears far, far weaker from even just a few years ago. And adversaries have no intention of letting up.

Tehran warns that it's ready to hit back harder.

IRGC says it is willing to hit back from Iran for any new Israeli escalation, including then it attacks in Syria.

Iran FM: we warned Washington that response in face of an Israeli attack will be ""faster, stronger, and broader"" (via AJ).

US reiterates that it ""does not seek conflict with Iran.""

Update(1329ET):It appears things are moving fast, via Israel's Channel 12 broadcaster, following the earlier conclusion of Israel's War Cabinet meeting:

THE ISRAELI AIR FORCE HAS COMPLETED ITS PREPARATION FOR AN IMMINENT ATTACK AGAINST IRAN

The Times of Israel top headline hasswitched to:War cabinet decides to hit Iran back hard, hopes it won’t spark regional war

A host of airlines have canceled flights to the region, including thefollowing:

Germany’s Lufthansa has suspended its regular flights to and from Tel Aviv, Erbil, and Amman, up to and including Monday. Flights to Beirut and Tehran will remain suspended until at least Thursday.

KLM cancelled all flights to and from Tel Aviv until Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Dutch arm of Air France says.

Britain’s easyJet on Sunday paused operations to and from Tel Aviv. The carrier said in an emailed statement to Reuters that it will temporarily pause operations to and from Tel Aviv until April 21.

Wizz Air says it had cancelled most of its flights to and from Tel Aviv, Saturday through Monday.

Finnair has suspended operations in Iranian airspace until further notice, which may cause longer flight times on flights from Doha. A spokesperson said the Finnish carrier will reroute over Egypt, resulting in delays of a “few minutes.”

Update(1225ET):Israel is looking to ""send a message"" against Iran, but short of causing outright war and mass casualties, a top level official has toldThe Washington Post. During Monday's Israel War Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu is reported to have requested defense leaders todraw up a list of targets.

According to Washington Post'sreporting:

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked the Israel Defense Forces toprovide target options, according to an official familiar with high-level discussions, who said Israel is looking at options that would “send a message” but not cause casualties.

Those options include apotential strike on a facility in Tehran or a cyberattack, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.

“Everybody agrees that Israel must respond,”the official said. “How to respond, when to respond, is the question.”

Israeli officials are now signaling to their US counterparts that they would like the White House's backing and coordination for retaliation, however, so far President Biden has urged restraint. This weekend the president clearly said the US will not back an Israeli military attack on Iran, on fears it would spark a bigger war.

Biden has issued what appears an ambiguous statement, and Israel's military says it is preparing:

Update(1145ET):Israel's war cabinet has issued a statement, reported in the country's Channel 12 broadcaster, according to breaking reports:

Israel wants toembark on action against Iran coordinated with US, channel 12 says — Reuters

Channel 12 has cited top Israeli ministers to say that the military's objective will be to""hurt Iran without causing all-out war,""according to news wires.

But the Biden administration has already said it will not back a retaliatory attack on Iran, amid fears of the situation spiraling into all-out regional war.

As for Tehran, it is warning that in the face of any Israeli assault it will hit back harder. According to BBC Iran correspondentKasra Naji:

Iran's IRGC commander:in new equation every time Israel attacks our interests, assets, personalities or citizens, we will hit back from our soil. Israel's Def Minister: we won't accept an equation in which Iran responds with a direct attack every time we strike targets in Syria.

Recall that before the Saturday night Iranian attack, Israel's leadership vowed that a major response would happen if the Islamic Republic directly attacks Israel from its soil. Indeed that's precisely what Iran did - it launched hundreds of drones and ballistic missiles directly from its territory.

Iran has lifted suspensions on domestic and international flights from its capital, Tehran, the state-run IRNA news agency reported, possibly signaling a return to stabilization for now.

It comes as Israel weighs its response to the strikes and world leaders call for restraint.

Global airlines faced ongoing disruptions to flights after Iran’s missile and drone attacks on Israel narrowed options for planes navigating between Europe and Asia.

Update(1030ET):The Wall Street Journal issued a mid-morning report citing US officials who predict that Israel will quickly launch a military response on Iran, and that it's expected to come asearly as today...

U.S. and Western officialsanticipate that Israel will quickly respond to Iran’s attacks, as soon as Monday, officials said. But the officials said they hoped both countries could come away with a sense of victory, giving them an off ramp that would limit escalatory moves.

Israel's war cabinet convened again Monday (but there are contradictory reports), however it has as yet issued no clear decision (nothing communicated to the public at least) - and the question of whether the Netanyahu government has decided to pursue retribution on a military level remains open. It will likely be a 'surprise' attack - and the public will hear about it only when missiles are airborne.

The WSJ report is also full of caveats while presenting the alarming assessment ofUS officials:

Israel might also choose to defer action until a later point. One option is “‘we will respond, but not immediately.’Iran will give Israel reason to respond and retaliate in future,” said Ehud Yaari, a fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “I think it’s very clear at this point that Israel would have to do something about Iran at some point, but not now,” he added.

⚡Iran's Foreign Minister tells British counterpart: Tehran does not favour increased tension but it will respond instantly and stronger than before if Israel retaliates - state media — Reuters

Shortly on the heels of the WSJ quote being issued, Axios issued its own bombshell which points the way to an Israeli response to Tehranbeing imminent:

Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin Sunday thatIsrael has no choicebut to respond to the unprecedented missile and drone attack launched by Iran over the weekend, a U.S. official and another source briefed on the call told Axios.

2024-04-15 15:23:32,Sober Analysis: War as the Health of the State,https://web.archive.org/web/20240416123035/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-15/sober-analysis-war-health-state,"Originally published viaArmageddon Prose:

The Machiavellian scheming that goes into the waging of war runs several layers deeper than most surface-level analyses marketed to public would suggest, tailored as they are to increasingly short attention spans.

The problem with peace is that the interests that determine war and peace rarely find any use for the latter, whereas they find plenty in war. War delivers the goods in terms of:

·       increased domestic crackdown on political dissidence (“we’re in a war, pass the PATRIOT Act or you hate America”; “you’re either with us or you’re with the

·       distractions from vexing internal political problems and a new scapegoat (See:the White House constantly blaming Russia for inflation)

·       increased “national security” funding

·       the public-to-private transfer money into the pockets of the ruling elites laundered through “defense” contracts

·       a terrorized and compliant public (“The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.” -H.L. Mencken)

·       various other perks

Certainly, the average individual, per longstanding liberal theory in political science dating back to Immanuel Kant, benefits economically and socially from protracted peace, but the conflation of the interest of the average subject of the state and the state itself is a common fallacy.

(This is a tangent, but the common use of “we,” while understandable shorthand, to describe what the U.S. government does is sloppy. “We” don’t do anything; the government confiscates the wealth of the people, which is views solely as its revenue base and not its constituency, and then does what it likes largely outside of the confines of any public accountability, save for the ceremonial pretense of oversight granted to the Congress. There is no “we” in the equation. The people of the United States are inherently and increasingly separate entities from the government itself.)

Related:‘War Is Peace’: MSNBC Claims (Again) That Voting Is Anti-Democratic

Its leaders and their children being spared from conscripted service in the trenches, from the state’s perspective, the only real disincentive, in fact, from engaging in war as a default state of affairs as did the Inner Party in 1984 is the threat to the state itself, either from external conquest or internal uprising or economic implosion.

Let’s survey the geopolitical landscape for a moment.

The Iranian regime has been the target ofvarious protest movements over recent years. It turns out a large swathe of the Persian population has little interest in living under an Islamic theocracy, which in 1979 opportunistically seized power over the historically moderate and relatively secular nation during a period of popular revolt against a Western puppet regime that the CIA installed in a coup in 1953 to replace an Iranian nationalist leader who committed the crime of wanting to keep Iranian oil revenue for the benefit of the Iranian people.

Now, under threat of war, the Ayatollah has new political life.

Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, in striking parallels to the Iranian situation,was very likely to be shipped off to prisonon corruption charges before war erupted in the latter part of 2023. His regime was on the brink of electoral collapse. Things are looking much brighter for Bibi now — so long as he can keep the war going indefinitely. He has alsodispatched his representatives to refuse any full-throated investigation into the apparent security failures of October 7untilafterthe war ends, which increasingly looks to mean “never.”

On the American home front, the Brandon entity has been having a hell of a time pushing money for his handlers’ various wars through Congress. Following the events of the past weekend, White House spokesman John Kirby is already using the Iranian drone attack as a further pretext to push the stalled national security bill through Congress.

https://www.youtube.com/live/9pRbB53RgRE?si=te3sKMyp5xpJjj49

So, the question becomes: what interest do any of these entities have in peace? Where do the incentives lie?

The various actors certainly have preferences in terms of timing and narrative-setting and under what terms their wars are fought. But the essential issue of whether war is desirable and necessary has never been in dispute by any state with a thirst for power, which is to say any state at all in the history of mankind.

“The war, therefore if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are incapable of hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that the hierarchical society needs. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all.The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. The very word ""war,"" therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure that is exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and has been replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same if the three superstates, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed forever from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war. This--although the vast majority of Party members understand it only in a shallower sense--is the inner meaning of the Party slogan: WAR IS PEACE.”

2024-04-15 17:48:42,"""I Can't Go To My Son's Graduation"": NY Judge Threatens Trump With Arrest",https://web.archive.org/web/20240416123035/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/trump-trial-manhattan-indictment-new-york-legal-system,"Update (1750ET):The first day of Donald Trump's 'hush money' trial was fairly uneventful - aside from the judge, a complete dick,barring the former President from attending his son's graduation and threatening arrest if he does.

Speaking after a long day of jury selection and ground rules (with more than50 jurors dismissed), Trump walked out of the courtroom and expressed his obvious displeasure.

""As you know my son is graduating from High School, and looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation for a son who's worked very, very hard,"" Trump said, adding that he was ""looking forward for years to having graduation with his mother and father there,"" adding that the trial is a ""scam"" and a ""political witch hunt.""

BREAKING: Donald Trump speaks out after Judge Merchan informed him that he could not attend his son Barron’s high school graduation or he will be jailed.pic.twitter.com/exkZVQeGSS

Judge Juan Merchan also won't allow Trump to attend a Supreme Court hearing in DC regarding immunity.

""We got a real problem with this Judge,"" Trump continued, adding ""thatI can't go to my son's graduation,or that I can't go to the United States Supreme Court, that I'm not in Georgia or Florida or North Carolina campaigning like I should be... it'sperfect for the radical left Democrats - that's exactly what they want,""he continued, adding that it's ""election interference.""

This case is obviously a corruption of the law.Lawfare.

Update (1200ET):Monday's 'hush money' trial against former President Donald Trump has begun, with jury selection and a discussion over evidence on the table. To get the blow-by-blow throughout the day, followthis thread on Xby Inner City Press.

The case stems from a $130,000 payment made by Trump's former lawyer, convicted felon and admitted liar Michael Cohen, to adult film actress Stormy Daniels at the end of the 2016 election in an alleged scheme to buy her silence. Trump is required to be present for the trial, which will take place four days a week and could last up to two months.

Judge Juan Merchan kicked off the day by refusing a request by Trump's legal team torecuse himself from the caseover an interview he gave to the press in which he mentioned the case, which Merchan said was within the law - while Merchan's wife and daughter have worked forprominent Democratsand/or made anti-Trump statements.

Prosecutors sought to include evidence from the Access Hollywood 'grab 'em by the pussy' tape, as well as various sexual assault allegations from Trump accusers. Merchan allowed a transcript of the tape, and denied a request to present the other allegations in court.

Prosecutor: We seek to elicit the fact the additional allegations against Mr. Trump emerged in the wake of the Access Hollywood tape. The candidate became obsessed with denying and denigrating his accusers. Here's what will be come Peoples' 409...

Next, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked Trump's attorneys to explain how the former president shouldn't be held in contempt for allegedly violating Merchan's gag order - arguing that Trump's efforts have continued to this day, and that witnesses in the case ""have incurred the wrath of Trump supporters.""

And now,jury selection begins...with Merchan telling the court that500 prospective jurors are waiting.

Stay tuned for updates...

Authored by Jonathan Turley,

I have long been critical of the case as a clear example of the weaponization of the criminal justice system.No one seriously believes that Alvin Bragg would have spent this time and money to prosecute what is ordinarily a state misdemeanor if the defendant was anyone other than Trump.One does not have to be like Trump to repel from the spectacle about to unfold in Manhattan.

The famous Roman philosopher and orator Marcus Tullius Cicero once said,“The more laws, the less justice.”

This week, New York judges and lawyers appear eager to prove that the same is true forcases against Donald Trump.

Afteran absurd $450 million decisioncourtesy of Attorney General Letitia James, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg will bring his equally controversial criminal prosecution over hush money paid to a former porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.

Lawyers have been scouring the civil and criminal codesfor any basis to sue or prosecute Trumpbefore the upcoming 2024 election.This week will highlight the damage done to New York’s legal system because of this unhinged crusade. They’ve charged him with everything short of ripping a label off a mattress.

Just a few weeks ago, another judge imposed a roughly half billion dollar penalty in a case without a single victim who lost a single cent on loans with Trump. (Indeed, bank officials testified they wanted more business with the Trump organization).

NowBragg is bringing a case that has taken years to developand millions of dollars in litigation cost for all parties. That is all over a crime from before the 2016 election that is a misdemeanor under state law that had already expired under the statute of limitations.

Like his predecessor, Braggpreviously scoffedat the case. However, two prosecutors, Carey R. Dunne and Mark F. Pomerantz, then resigned and started a public pressure campaign to get New Yorkers to demand prosecution.

Pomerantz shocked many of us by publishing a book on the case against Trump —  who was still under investigation and not charged, let alone convicted, of any crime. He did so despite objections from his former colleague that such a book was grossly improper.

Nevertheless, it worked. Bragg brought a Rube Goldberg case that is so convoluted and counterintuitive thateven liberal legal analysts criticized it.

Trump paid Daniels to avoid any publicity over their brief alleged affair. As a celebrity, there was ample reason to want to keep the affair quiet, and that does not even include the fact that he is a married man.

It also occurred before the 2016 election and there was clearly a benefit to quash the scandal as a candidate. That political motivation is at the heart of this long-delayed case.

It is arepeat of the caseinvolving former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards.In 2012, theJustice Department used the same theory to charge the former Democratic presidential candidateafter a disclosure that he not only had an affair with filmmaker Rielle Hunter but also hid the fact that he had a child by her. Edwards denied the affair, and money from donors was passed to Hunter to keep the matter quiet.

The Justice Department spent a huge amount on the case to show that the third-party payments were a circumvention of campaign finance laws. However, Edwards was ultimately foundnot guilty on one count while the jury deadlocked on the other five.

With Trump, the Justice Department declined a repeat of the Edwards debacle and did not bring any federal charge.

But Bragg then used the alleged federal crime to bootstrap a defunct misdemeanor charge into a felony in the current case. He is arguing that Trump intentionally lied when his former lawyer Michael Cohen listed the payments as retainer costs rather than a payment — to avoid reporting it as a campaign contribution to himself.

Thus, if he had simply had Cohen report the payment as “hush money,” there would be no crime.

Once again, the contrast to other controversies is telling.

Before the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton’s campaign denied that it had funded the infamous Steele dossier behind the debunked Russian collusion claims.

The funding was hidden as legal expenses by then-Clinton campaign general counsel Marc Elias.(The FEClater sanctioned by the campaignover its hiding of the funding.). When a reporter tried to report the story, he said Elias “pushed back vigorously, saying ‘You (or your sources) are wrong.’” Times reporterMaggie Habermandeclared, “Folks involved in funding this lied about it, and with sanctimony, for a year.”

Likewise, John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, was called before congressional investigators anddenied categorically any contractual agreement with Fusion GPS. Sitting beside him was Elias, who reportedly said nothing to correct the misleading information given to Congress.

Yet, there were no charges stemming from the hiding of the funding, though it was all part of the campaign budget.

Making this assorted business even more repellent will be the appearance of Cohen himself on the stand.Cohen recently was denouncedby a judge as a serial perjurer who is continuing to game the system.

Cohen has a long record as a legal thug who has repeatedly lied when it served his interests. He has a knack for selling his curious skill set to powerful figures like Trump and now Bragg.

For those of us who have been critics of Cohen from when he was still working for Trump, it is mystifying that anyone would call him to the stand to attest to anything short of the time of day . . . and even then most of us would check our watches.

Fortunately witnesses are no longer required to put their hand on the bible in swearing to testify truthfully in court. Otherwise, the court would need the New York Fire Department standing by in case the book burst into flames.

So this is the case: A serial perjurer used to convert a dead state misdemeanor into a felony based on an alleged federal election crime that was rejected by the Justice Department.

They could well succeed in a city where nine out of ten potential jurors despise Trump. Trying Trump in Manhattan is about as difficult as the New York Yankees going to bat using beach balls rather than baseballs. It is hard to miss.

However, this is a Pyrrhic victory for the New York legal system. Whatever the outcome, it may prove a greater indictment of the New York court system than the defendant.

2024-04-15 20:40:00,Crime-Ridden San Francisco Wants To Punish Grocery Stores For Fleeing Said Crime,https://web.archive.org/web/20240416123035/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/crime-ridden-san-francisco-wants-punish-grocery-stores-fleeing-said-crime#comment-stream,"Unpunished crime is so out of control in San Francisco thatthe city now wants to punish grocery stores who want to leave.

Under the 'Grocery Protection Act' introduced by city Board of Supervisors member Dean Preston (Democratic Socialist), stores that want to flee all the crime and other increased liabilitieswill have to provide the city with six months advanced notice, and make efforts to find a replacement supermarket for the location being vacated,Benzingareports.

The move comes afterWhile Foods shut down its flagship store in San Franciscoafter being open for just over a year, citing employee safety concerns.

The reports show howworkers at the store were routinely threatened with weapons, while vagrants would throw food at staff, engage in fights, and even defecate on the floor.

One incident sawa homeless man with a knife spray an employee with a fire extinguisher.

There were also cases ofdrug overdoseswithone man dying in the bathroomafter overdosing on fentanyl and methamphetamine. Thefts were also common with large quantities of alcohol stolen from the store.  -Daily Mail

Nearly570 emergency calls were loggedfrom the location, including one call with desperate pleas to the police saying ""male [with] machete is back,"" and ""another security guard was just assaulted.""

Former SF Board of Supervisors member Matt Dorsey (whowasn'tassaulted at Whole Foods) said he was ""incredibly disappointed"" at the closing.

""Our neighborhood waited a long time for this supermarket, butwe’re also well aware of problems they’ve experiencedwith drug-related retail theft, adjacent drug markets and the many safety issues related to them,"" Dorsey said.

According to Preston, ""Our communities need notice, an opportunity to be heard and a transition plan when major neighborhood grocery stores plan to shut their doors.""

Preston's proposal would allowanyone impacted by a noncompliant store closure to initiate legal proceedings.

AsBenzingafurther notes, ""It’s not just grocery stores that have had enough of the city. Other large businesses that recently closed their downtown San Francisco locations include Adidas, AT&T Inc., Nordstrom and Lego Group.""

Maybe start punishing crime?

Asbirth ratesfall across the globe, what does this mean for the world’s most populous countries?

To find out,Visual Capitalist's Marcus Lu visualized forecastsfor the world’s six largest countries using data from thelatest revised versionof theUN World Population Prospects 2022.

Projections are based on a “medium fertility scenario”, which assumes countries will converge at a birth rate of1.85 children per woman, by 2045-2050.

China’s population boom has officially come to an end, with the country reporting two consecutive years of decreases (down850,000in 2022, and2.1 millionin 2023).

Note: Figures are rounded.

The country’s population in 2050 is forecasted to be1.32 billion, which is roughly the same as it was in 2007. The UN believes this demographic downtrend will accelerate as we enter the second half of the century.

What does this mean for the Chinese economy? Many worry that asmaller workforce, coupled with anaging population, will increase healthcare expenditures and hamper economic growth.

Meanwhile, the UN believes that India’s population will peak somewhere in the mid 2060s, just shy of the1.7 billionmark.

India’s population will not age as quickly as its neighbor. Those over the age of 65 will representless than one-fifthof the population until 2060, and their share of India’s total number of people and will not approach 30% until 2100.

Note: Figures are rounded.

Finally, whether these predictions come true or not will depend on how quickly birth rates fall as the country develops. For example, India’s fertility rate fell from6.2in 1950, to2.0in 2021 (births per woman).

2024-04-15 23:40:00,The WHO's Road To Totalitarianism,https://web.archive.org/web/20240416123035/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/whos-road-totalitarianism#comment-stream,"Authored by Bert Olivier via The Brownstone Institute,

Several articles on the proposed amendments to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) international health regulations have appeared here on Brownstone, such as this excellentintroduction. Consequently, there is no need to repeat this information in a similar format.What I would like to do instead is to pursue the question, what the implications would be for people worldwide if this organisation were to be successful in getting the representatives of member countries to accept the proposed amendments. More specifically, what are the likely consequences in terms of the concept and practice oftotalitarianism?

To understand this, one has to get to grips with the mode of rule called totalitarian government, of course, but I doubt whether most people have an adequate grasp of full-fledged totalitarian rule, despite recently experiencing it to a certain degree under “pandemic” conditions.Should the amendments proposed by the WHO be accepted in May, the citizens of the world would be subjected to unadulterated totalitarianism,however, so it is worthwhile exploring the full implications of this “anonymous” mode of governance here.

This is done in the hope that, if representatives of the people—which is what they are supposed to be—in legislative bodies around the world were to read this article, as well as others related to the same topic, they wouldthink twice before supporting a motion or bill which would, in effect, grant the WHO the right to usurp the sovereignty of member nations. The recent developments in the state of Louisiana in the United States, which amount to the rejection of the WHO’s authority, should be an inspiration to other states and countries to follow its example. This is the way tobeat the WHO’s mendacious “pandemic treaty.”

On her website, calledFreedom Research, Dr. Meryl Nass has described the WHO’s notion of “pandemic preparedness” as a “scam/boondoggle/Trojan horse,” which aims (among other things) to transfer billions of taxpayer dollars to the WHO as well as other industries, in order to vindicate censorship in the name of “public health,” andperhaps most importantly, to transfer sovereignty regarding decision-making for “public health” globally to the Director-General of the WHO (which means that legally, member countries would lose their sovereignty).

In addition, she highlights the fact that the WHO intends to use the idea of “One Health” to subsume all living beings, ecosystems, as well as climate change under its own “authority”; further, to acquire more pathogens for wide distribution, in this way exacerbating the possibility of pandemics while obscuring their origin, and in the event of such pandemics occurring, justifying the development of more (mandatory) “vaccines” and the mandating of vaccine passports (and of lockdowns) globally, thus increasingcontrol(the key term here) over populations. Should its attempt at a global power grab succeed, the WHO would have the authority to impose any “medical” programme it deems necessary for “world health,” regardless of their efficacy and side-effects (including death).

In the preceding paragraph I italicised the word “control” as a key term.What should be added to it is the term “total”—that is, “total control.”This is the gist of totalitarian rule, and it should therefore be easy to see that what the WHO (together with the WEF and the U.N.) strives for is total or complete control of all people’s lives.

No one has analysed and elaborated on totalitarianism from this perspective more thoroughly than the German-born, American philosopher, Hannah Arendt, and her monumental study of this phenomenon—“The Origins of Totalitarianism” (1951 and in enlarged format, 1958) still stands as the authoritative source for the understanding of its historical manifestations. The latter, focused on by Arendt, are 20th-century Nazism and Stalinism, but it is not difficult to perceive its lineaments in what we have been living through since 2020—although a strong case could be made that 2001 marked its identifiable beginning, when (in the wake of 9/11) thePatriot Actwas passed, arguably laying theauthoritariangroundwork for totalitarian rule as clearly perceived byHenry Giroux.

Arendt (p. 274 of the Harvest, Harcourt edition of “The Origins of Totalitarianism,” 1976) singles out “total terror” as the essence of totalitarian government, and elaborates as follows:

“By pressing men against each other, total terror destroys the space between them; compared to the condition within its iron band, even the desert of tyranny [which she distinguishes from totalitarianism; B.O.], insofar as it is still some kind of space, appears like a guarantee of freedom. Totalitarian government does not just curtail liberties or abolish essential freedoms; nor does it, at least to our limited knowledge, succeed in eradicating the love for freedom from the hearts of man. It destroys the one essential prerequisite of all freedom which is simply the capacity of motion which cannot exist without space.”

Reading this evocative characterisation of totalitarianism in terms of “total terror” makes one realise anew, with a start, how fiendishly clever the perpetrators of the so-called “pandemic” emergency were—which was no real pandemic, of course, as theGerman government recently admitted. It was the thin edge of the wedge, as it were, to insinuate “total terror” into our lives by means of curtailing our access tofree movement in space. “Lockdowns” are the signature tool for implementing restrictions of free movements in space.

It may not, on the face of it, appear to be the same as, or similar to, the incarceration of prisoners in the concentration camps under Nazi rule, but arguably the psychological effects of lockdowns approximate those experienced by inmates of these notorious camps in the 1940s. After all, if you are not allowed to leave your house, except to go to the shop to buy food and other essentials before you hurry back home—where you dutifully sanitise all the items you bought (a concrete reminder that venturing out in space is “potentially lethal”)—the imperative is the same: “You are not allowed out of this enclosure, except under specified conditions.” It is understandable that the imposition of such strict spatial boundaries engenders a pervasive sense of fear, which eventually morphs into terror.

Small wonder the pseudo-authorities promoted—if not “commanded”—“working (and studying) from home,” leaving millions of people cloistered in their houses in front of their computer screens (Plato’s cave wall). And banning meetings in public, except for a few concessions as far as the numbers of attendees at certain gatherings were concerned, was just as effective regarding the intensification of terror. Most people would not dare transgress these spatial restrictions, given the effectiveness of the campaign, to instil a dread of the supposedly lethal “novel coronavirus” in populations, exacerbating “total terror” in the process. The images ofpatients in hospitals, attached to ventilators, and sometimes looking appealingly, desperately at the camera, only served to exacerbate this feeling of dread.

With the advent of the much-hyped COVID pseudo-“vaccines,” another aspect of generating terror among the populace manifested itself in the guise of relentless censorship of all dissenting views and opinions on the “efficacy and safety” of these, as well as on the comparable effectiveness of early treatment of COVID by means ofproven remediessuch as Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin.The clear aim of this was to discredit contrarians who raised doubts over the official valorisation of these supposedly miraculous cures for the disease, and to isolate them from the mainstream as “conspiracy theorists.”

Arendt’s insight into the indispensable function of space for human movement also casts the WEF’s plans to create “15-minute cities” worldwide in a disturbing new light. These have been described as “open-air concentration camps,” which would eventually become a reality by prohibiting movement outside of these demarcated areas, after an initial period of selling the idea as a way of combating climate change by walking and cycling instead of using carbon-emitting motor cars. The WEF and WHO’s “concern” withclimate changeas a putative threat to global health offers further justification for these planned variations on prisons for the thinly disguised incarceration of millions of people.

The pertinence of Arendt’s thinking on totalitarianism for the present does not end here, though. Just as relevant as the manner in which it cultivates terror is her identification oflonelinessandisolationas prerequisites for total domination. She describes isolation—in the political sphere—as “pre-totalitarian.”It is typical of thetyrannicalgovernments of dictators (which are pre-totalitarian), where it functions to prevent citizens from wielding some power by acting together.

Loneliness is the counterpart of isolation in the social sphere; the two are not identical, and the one can be the case without the other. One can be isolated or kept apart from others without being lonely; the latter only sets in when one feels abandoned by all other human beings. Terror, Arendt sagely observes, can “rule absolutely” only over people who have been “isolated against each other” (Arendt 1975, pp. 289–290). It therefore stands to reason that, to achieve the triumph of totalitarian rule, those promoting its inception would create the circumstances where individuals feel increasingly isolated as well as lonely.

It is superfluous to remind anyone of the systematic inculcation of both of these conditions in the course of the “pandemic” through what has been discussed above, particularly lockdowns, the restriction of social contact at all levels, and through censorship, which—as remarked above—was clearly intended to isolate dissenting individuals.And those who were isolated in this way, were often—if not usually—abandoned by their family and friends, with the consequence that loneliness could, and sometimes did, follow. In other words, the tyrannical imposition of COVID regulations served the (probably intended) purpose of preparing the ground for totalitarian rule by creating the conditions for isolation and loneliness to become pervasive.

How does totalitarian government differ from tyranny and authoritarianism, where one may still discern the figures of the despot, and the sway of some abstract ideal, respectively? Arendt writes that (p. 271–272):

“If lawfulness is the essence of non-tyrannical government and lawlessness is the essence of tyranny, then terror is the essence of totalitarian domination.

“Terror is the realization of the law of movement; its chief aim is to make it possible for the force of nature or of history to race freely through mankind, unhindered by any spontaneous human action. As such, terror seeks to ‘stabilize’ men in order to liberate the forces of nature or history. It is this movement which singles out the foes of mankind against whom terror is let loose, and no free action of either opposition or sympathy can be permitted to interfere with the elimination of the ‘objective enemy’ of History or Nature, of the class or the race. Guilt and innocence become senseless notions; ‘guilty’ is he who stands in the way of the natural or historical process which has passed judgement over ‘inferior races,’ over individuals ‘unfit to live,’ over ‘dying classes and decadent peoples.’ Terror executes these judgements, and before its court, all concerned are subjectively innocent: the murdered because they did nothing against the system, and the murderers because they do not really murder but execute a death sentence pronounced by some higher tribunal. The rulers themselves do not claim to be just or wise, but only to execute historical or natural laws; they do not apply [positive] laws, but execute a movement in accordance with its inherent law. Terror is lawfulness, if law is the law of the movement of some suprahuman force, Nature or History.”

The reference to nature and history as suprahuman forces pertains to what Arendt (p. 269) claims to have been the undergirding beliefs of National Socialism and Communism, respectively, in the laws of nature and of history as being independent, virtually primordial powers in themselves. Hence the justification of terror being inflicted on those who seem to stand in the way of the unfolding of these impersonal forces. When read carefully, the excerpt, above, paints a picture of totalitarian rule as something predicated on the neutralisation of people, as human beings, in society as potential agents or participants in its organisation or the direction in which it develops. The “rulers” are not rulers in the traditional sense; they are merely there to ensure that the suprahuman force in question is left unhindered to unfold as it “should.”

It takes no genius to perceive in Arendt’s perspicacious characterisation of totalitarian domination—whichshe relates to Nazism and Stalinism as its historical embodiments—a kind of template which applies to the emerging totalitarian character of what first manifested itself in 2020 as iatrocracy, under the subterfuge of a global health emergency—something well known to all of us today. Since then other features of this totalitarian movement have emerged, all of which cohere into what may be described, in ideological terms, as “transhumanism.”

This, too, fits into Arendt’s account of totalitarianism—not thetranshumanistcharacter, as such, of this latest incarnation of the attempt to harness humanity as a whole to a suprahuman power, but itsideologicalstatus. Just as the Nazi regime justified its operations by appealing to nature (in the guise of the vaunted superiority of the “Aryan race,” for example), so the group of technocratic globalists driving the (not so) “Great Reset” appeals to theideaof going “beyond humanity” to a supposed superior (non-natural) “species” instantiating afusion between humans and machines—also anticipated, it seems, by the “singularity” artist calledStelarc. I emphasised “idea” because, as Arendt observes (p. 279–280),

“An ideology is quite literally what its name indicates: it is the logic of an idea. Its subject matter is history, to which the ‘idea’ is applied; the result of this application is not a body of statements about something that is, but the unfolding of a process which is in constant change. The ideology treats the course of events as though it followed the same ‘law’ as the logical exposition of its ‘idea.’”

Given the nature of an ideology, explicated above, it should be evident how this applies to the transhumanist ideology of the neo-fascist cabal:the idea underpinning the historical process has supposedly always been a kind of transhumanist teleology—allegedly the (previously hidden) telos or goal of all of history has constantly been the attainment of a state of surpassing mere Homo and Gyna sapiens sapiens (the doubly wise human man and woman) and actualising the “transhuman.”Is it at all surprising that they have claimed to haveacquired god-like powers?

This further explains the unscrupulousness with which the transhumanist globalists can countenance the functioning and debilitating effects of “total terror” as identified by Arendt. “Total terror” here means the pervasive or totalising effects of, for example, installing encompassing systems of impersonal, largely AI-controlled surveillance, and communicating to people—at least initially—that it is for their own safety and security. The psychological consequences, however, amount to a subliminal awareness of the closure of “free space,” which is replaced by a sense of spatial confinement, and of there being “no way out.”

Against this backdrop, reflecting on the looming possibility that the WHO may succeed in getting compliant nations to accept the proposed amendments to their health regulations, yields greater insight into the concrete effects this would have.And these aren’t pretty, to say the least. In a nutshell, it means that this unelected organisation would have the authority to proclaim lockdowns and “medical (or health) emergencies,” as well as mandatory “vaccinations” at the whim of the WHO’s Director-General, reducing the freedom to traverse space freely to ironclad spatial confinement in one fell swoop.This is what “total terror” would mean. It is my fervent hope that something can still be done to avert this imminent nightmare.

2024-04-16 02:00:00,Security Ramped-Up In Germany After Jihadists Threaten Drone Strikes At Euro 2024,https://web.archive.org/web/20240416123035/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/security-ramped-germany-after-jihadists-threaten-drone-strikes-euro-2024,"Authored by Thomas Brooke via ReMix News,

An offshoot terror cell affiliated with Islamic State has published propaganda encouraging jihadists to target German football stadiums during this summer’s European Championships.

In the latest issue of the “Voice of Khorasan” magazine, a publication run by ISKP, or Islamic State — Khorasan Province, the terror organization called for jihad at Europe’s flagship football tournament, which runs for a month in Germany from June 14 until July 14.

Against a backdrop of an explosive drone flying across a football stadium, the publication used the headline,“If they restrict and oppress you on the ground, then attack them from the sky.”

“Run over the infidels with your car, hit them with a knife, with poison, or blow out their brains with bullets and set fire to their houses,”it further wrote.

German security services are understood to be treating the message as a credible threat. They are ramping up surveillance and implementing measures to combat any attempts to use drone strikes against stadiums hosting the event, which is expected to be attended by hundreds of thousands of football fans from across Europe.

The threat is the latest in a long line of menacing imagery published by terror cells to inflict fear across the continent.

Earlier this month, images circulated online of jihadists vowing to target the UEFA Champions League quarter-final games, prompting the authorities to bolster defenses at stadiums across Western Europe.

“The main question is whether these are free riders or a serious threat,”a high-ranking state security officer told Focus.

Authorities, however, are unwilling to take a risk on security and will treat the threat as credible.

“It is to be feared that other terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda will also use their PR channels to agitate for an attack offensive in Europe and Germany,”the source added.

The Afghan splinter group of Islamic State has grown in stature in recent months to become the primary organization of concern for security officials across Europe.

Amajor counter-terror operation took place in the German city of Cologne before Christmasafter security services in Austria, Germany, and Spain received intelligence of jihadists affiliated with the group planning to carry out several attacks at Christian landmarks including Cologne Cathedral.

Last month,two Afghan nationals with ties to the U.N.-proscribed terror cell were arrested in Germanyon suspicion of planning a terror attack near the Swedish parliament to avenge the permittance of Koran-burning demonstrations in the country.

Several individuals are understood to haveexploited the migratory route from Ukraine to enter the European Union to plan attacks, with Tajikistan and Turkmenistan nationals arrested in Germany in July last year having entered Western Europe from the war-torn country.

Authorities in neighboring France are also concerned about the threat of terror attacks during Paris’ hosting of the summer Olympic Games this year, and its organizers have devised a“Plan B”in case terror threats jeopardize the event’s opening ceremony.

“There is no terrorist threat to the Olympics and Paralympics today, but we will continue to monitor the situation,”Oudéa-Castéra told France 2 earlier this month.

“Just because we don’t talk about it, just because we don’t mention Plan B, doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist.”

The terror alert level in France remains at the highest possible due to concerns over Islamic radicals and fears of retaliation against the West because of the war in Israel.

2024-04-16 02:45:00,US Says Over 90 Missiles & Drones Were Launched From Yemen In Past 48 Hours,https://web.archive.org/web/20240416123035/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/us-says-over-90-missiles-drones-were-launched-yemen-past-48-hours#comment-stream,"New statements from the Pentagon issued Monday have said the Houthisfired over 90 ballistic missiles and drones- most of which were intercepted by US and allied forces over the past 48 hours, once the Iranian attack kicked off in the overnight hours of Saturday.

US Central Command described that at one point during the attack the Houthis fired ananti-ship ballistic missile directly against US Navy and commercial ships in the Gulf of Aden. ""There were no injuries or damage reported by US, coalition, or commercial ships,"" CENTCOMsaid.

Of the 90 total projectiles fired, the CENTCOM says its forcesintercepted over 80 drones and at least six ballistic missiles total.

""Iran’s continued unprecedented, malign, and reckless behavior endangers regional stability and the safety of US and coalition forces,"" CENTCOM said the the statement.

""CENTCOM remains postured to support Israel’s defense against these dangerous actions by Iran. We will continue to work with all our regional partners to increase regional security,"" it added.

The Houthis are expected to launch another phase of intense attacks in the scenario that Israel hits back at Iran. On Monday Israel's leadership in the war cabinet appears to have greenlighted such a retaliation attack.

On Monday it has also been coming to light to huge degree to which the US and Western allies were key in helping Israel repel the Iranian attack. According toThe Wall Street Journal:

Saturday’sIranian strike on Israelwas huge by any standard. Tehran launched more than 170 explosive-laden drones, around 120 ballistic missiles and about 30 cruise missiles, according to Israel.The damage could have been catastrophic. As it turned out, almost all were intercepted.

That success was due to a combination of Israel’s sophisticated air-defense system andcritical assistance provided by the U.S.andother Western and Arab partners. American, British and Jordanian warplanes played an especially important role in downing drones. Most of the Iranian drones and missiles were destroyed before they even reached Israeli airspace.

At this point the Middle East is bracing for a potential bigger Israel-Iran war which would likely spread to include Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen.

This is why the US and European leaders are busy urging restraint for Israel. A bigger war would also send the price of oil soaring, worsening Biden's reelection chances.

2024-04-16 03:30:00,'Transgender Archeology' PhDs And Degrees In 'Magic' Being Funded With UK Taxpayer Money,https://web.archive.org/web/20240416123035/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/transgender-archeology-phds-and-degrees-magic-being-funded-uk-taxpayer-money#comment-stream,"Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news,

A Conservative MP in the UK has called for a thorough review of government higher education funding after it was revealed that taxpayer money is being spent on ridiculous university courses, including a PhD researcher who has chose to explore “Transphobic Invocations of Archaeology.”

The Telegraphreportsthat the student at the University of York is being given more than £18,000 a year by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) to do detailed research and present papers, including one titledBones Don’t Care About Your Feelings: Challenging Transphobic Invocations of Archaeology in (Social) Media.

🔴 Ridicule over university’s ‘trans archeology’ coursehttps://t.co/GSKNBuEKKu

The student in question also gave a presentation that noted “What if I told you that when an archaeologist finds human remains, it is a fact that there [sic] only two choices for gender identification.”

The ‘research’ was also partially funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), a non-departmental government body that distributes funds for research, which claims that “research projects we support are made via a rigorous peer review process.”

Maybe make it a bit more rigorous then?

Commenting on the finding, biologist Dr Emma Hilton, co-founder of Sex Matters, noted “Human remains cannot tell us anything about the unembodied ‘gender identity’ of a person.”

Providing an example, Hilton urged that “A female Viking warrior buried with male-typical war possessions tells us only that some women successfully broke through early glass ceilings.”

As we previously highlighted, there is a push among gender activists within the field of archaeology to have anthropologists to be prevented from identifying human remains as male or female because it is not known how ancients would have self-identified.

In other words, far-left activists are now insisting that it is ‘transphobic’ for archaeologists and anthropologists to identify bones as male or female, because they don’t know if ancient people identified as a specific gender or not.

Pretty sure they had more pressing things to consider.

The same people have also insisted that archaeologists no longer categorise the race of remains as this “contributes to white supremacy.”

Don't give skeletons a gender or categorise race, woke warriors demandhttps://t.co/thUUnV6ue6

Other equally stupid research projects have been uncovered, including one at Cambridge University, which will involve a PhD studentinvestigating its collection of animals and plants to root out imperial connections, in an attempt to “decolonise the dodo”.

The project falls under the university’s efforts to address “legacies of enslavement and empire.”

University of Cambridge looking for students to 'decolonise dodos and tigers'https://t.co/Agh6joNXTU

Another course currently advertising for research positions lasting three years at full pay of £33,000 per year, is titled“The Europe That Gay Porn Built, 1945-2000.”

A further course at the University of Exeter offers a degree in ‘Magic and Occult Science,’ with the course leader claiming “Decolonisation, the exploration of alternative epistemologies, feminism and anti-racism are at the core of this programme.”

Degree in magic at University of Exeterhttps://t.co/eE0E4Lgk6S

This ridiculousness appears to be in part down to lobbyist groupsattempting to inject their ideological nonsense into education:

'This is pure Marxist theory designed to break down totally our entire societal structure.'@Nigel_Faragereacts to universities being told to 'go woke' and 'decolonise' courses from computing to classics by the degrees watchdog.#FarageOnGBNewspic.twitter.com/JwhMO2XZPd

Conservative MP Nick Fletcher said: “We need to call a scam a scam when we see it. This is taxpayers’ money, at a time when households are struggling – and the tax burden is at an all-time high.”

SCAM COURSES - YOUR TAXES WASTEDI will call it out whenever I see taxes being wasted. Your hard earned Taxes should be lower and spent wisely.I have spoken earlier about how students are being sold duff degrees. It’s not only a waste of taxes but it puts them in debt too.…pic.twitter.com/m0U0iustE1

“We should consider establishing a ‘Taxpayers’ Review Process’ to enable ordinary people to review and challenge UKRI and AHRC spending – similar to the process available for residents to review and challenge local authority accounts,” Fletcher added.

2024-04-16 04:15:00,"""Returning To Petrol"": Volkswagen EV Sales Plunge 25% In Europe",https://web.archive.org/web/20240416123035/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/returning-petrol-volkswagen-ev-sales-plunge-25-europe#comment-stream,"Europe is ""returning to petrol"",according to a new article from Yahoo Financewhich highlighted Volkswagen's EV sales as the canary in the coalmine.

Sales of Volkswagen's electric vehicles have declined by nearly 25% in Europe, with a noticeable shift back to gasoline-powered cars amid waning interest in battery-operated models, the report says.

It notes that the downturn, observed in the initial quarter of the year, is attributed to heightened inflation and escalating energy costs, which have cooled consumer enthusiasm for electric cars. Worldwide, Volkswagen, which also owns brands like Audi, Skoda, and Porsche, saw a 3% decrease in electric vehicle sales, totaling 136,400 units.In contrast, sales of traditional combustion engine vehicles rose by 4%, approaching two million units.

The report notes that demand for electric vehicles has dipped as governments in Europe reduce subsidies and soften ambitious goals to phase out petrol and diesel cars.

In the UK, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak delayed the prohibition of new petrol and diesel sales from 2030 to 2035 and removed incentives for new EV purchases last year. Despite Volkswagen's strong presence in the UK market with models like the Audi e-Tron and Volkswagen ID, petrol car demand is growing faster than electric.

In the EU, discussions are ongoing to modify bans on fossil fuel cars to permit synthetic fuels. The end of EV subsidies in Germany, coupled with the EU pausing emissions targets, has notably impacted Volkswagen's sales. Additionally, competition is intensifying with cheaper, subsidy-backed Chinese EVs entering the market.

Despite a significant drop in European EV sales, Volkswagen reported a 91% increase in China. Other manufacturers like BMW and Stellantis are also adjusting their electric vehicle strategies amid fluctuating consumer interest.

“Our diversified product portfolio gives us the necessary flexibility to compensate for fluctuations in demand in certain segments – as is currently the case with all-electric vehicles – in others,” said Hildegard Wortmann, a member of Volkswagen’s executive board.

Recallwe have been writingabout the influx of competition in EVs coming from China. Earlier this month, Mercedes-Benz boss Ola Källenius urged the EU to lower tariffs on EVs that are being imported from China. The call comes at the same time the European Commission is mulling whether to raise import duties as Europe continues to grapple with Chinese subsidies.

Källenius said that the increased competition would ""help Europe’s carmakers produce better cars in the long run""and that government protectionism is ""going the wrong way.

Källenius' comment is a free market slap in the face to the EU, which has claimed China is ""distorting"" the EV market. Recallback in September 2023 we wrotethat the EU was opening an investigation into Chinese EV subsidies.

At the time, we noted that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was taking exception with the fact that ""the global market is flooded with cheap Chinese cars"".

2024-04-16 05:45:00,The Best And Worst Countries For LGBTQ+ Travelers,https://web.archive.org/web/20240416123035/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/best-and-worst-countries-lgbtq-travelers#comment-stream,"In order to help LGBTQ+ tourists travel safely, the German portal Spartacus started publishingtheGay Travel Indexin 2012. In the 2024 edition, the ranking compared 213 countries and territories based on the situation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer people in each location.

As Statista's Anna Fleck reports,according to the index,last year’s leading destination Malta is joined at the top by Spain, Canada, New Zealand and Portugal as the safest and most open places for LGBT+ travelers in 2024,with each of these five countries receiving 12 points.

You will find more infographics atStatista

According to the report,Estonia made the greatest improvements in the past year,obtaining 6 points (in contrast to the previous index’s 2 points). This was thanks to the approval of the law in 2023 to legalize equal marriage. The first Latin American country to appear in the 2024 ranking is Uruguay, sharing the third position along with Denmark, Iceland, Germany and Norway, with 10 points each.

At the other end of the spectrum come Saudi Arabia, Iran, the Republic of Chechnya in Russia and Afghanistan, all with a score of -21 points, signaling that they are dangerous countries forLGBT+travelers,where homosexuals are persecuted and killed. Russia too features far down this list (-17 points), having once again “significantly tightened its anti-LGBT+ legislation and equates the movement with extremist organizations.""

To develop the index, the creators looked at 18 categories ranging frommarriage for allto the death penalty for LGBTQ+ people. The creators focus on political decisions affecting queer people, the legal framework and whether there are episodes of violence against them, among other parameters.

According to the authors of the report, the index is intended with all kinds of travelers in mind, including those looking to travel to countries where the LGBT+ community is an accepted and loved part of society as well as for those consciously looking to travel to a country in order to enter into a dialogue with the oppressed local queer community.

2024-04-16 06:30:00,"Transport Minister Threatens Germans With ""Indefinite Weekend Driving Ban"" To Meet Mandated Emissions Targets",https://web.archive.org/web/20240416123035/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/transport-minister-threatens-germans-indefinite-weekend-driving-ban-meet-mandated,"This story has even made it into the Anglophone press, so you know it’s a big deal:“German transport minister warns of weekend driving ban,” says The Telegraph. “German minister threatens ‘indefinite driving bans’ on weekends,” proclaims Politico. “German transport minister under fire for weekend driving ban threat,” declares Reuters.

Volker Wissing does not really want to ban driving.

But no, despite the headlines, they are not going to take away our cars.

Amazingly, not even the Greens want to do that. For once the story is not about German authoritarianism, or woke insanity or anything like that.

Rather, it’s about how nobody can really bring himself to care about the climate anymore – not even our forward-thinking, progressively minded, environmentally responsible political establishment.

For the backstory, we must go all the way back to the pre-Covid era, when aggressive climate legislation was popular even with centre-right CDU voters, and before the electorate had a taste of what Green policies likethe draconian home heating ordinancesreally feel like on the ground.

Back in those halcyon days, when the child saint Greta Thunberg was cutting class to save the earth, Angela Merkel’s government passed the Climate Protection Act.The law mandates a 65% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, an 88% reduction by 2040, and an utterly unrealisable carbon neutrality by 2045. In the near term, the Climate Protection Act also establishes maximum annual emissions levels for various economic sectors. Should a given sector exceed its maximum, the responsible Ministry must submit an ominous “action programme” to bring things back on target.

The Climate Protection Act is archetypal climate nonsense.Politicians like to take credit for Doing Something about the climate, but because Doing Something amounts to massive economic restrictions and drastic interventions in daily life, they would prefer not to Do that Something themselves. Far better is to pass legislation committing future governments to Do Something and let them deal with the mess. Then you can reap the short-term rewards of being tough on carbon emissions, without bearing direct responsibility for all the chaos that actually being tough on carbon emissions would unleash. Alas, time marches forwards at a steady pace. I am sure that 2030 sounded like an unimaginably distant date when it was floated at the Paris Accords in 2015, but now it is a mere six years away. That is becoming a big, big problem for the climatists.

You could say thatMerkel’s Climate Protection Act bequeathed the hapless Scholz government a small collection of ticking time bombs, which they’ve developed a considerable interest in defusing. One way to do this, is to revise the Climate Protection Act and remove its strict sector-based emissions limits before anybody is forced to field a climate-saving “action programme.” In the meantime, they’ve been studiously ignoring the requirements, which is why our Minister of Economic Destruction Robert Habeck could be found complaining back in Junethat no cabinet ministers were complying with Climate Protection Act emissions limits.

The fly in the ointment is the Green Party, who are as crazy as their oblivious out-of-touch upper middle-class urbanite constituents, and who have thought it best to block government efforts to (however temporarily) defang Merkel’s odious law.

In a fit of frustration, the liberal Transport Minister Volker Wissing therefore warned that if no Climate Protection Act reforms were possible,he might be forced to impose “drastic interventions” on motorists:

In the dispute over a reform of the Climate Protection Act, Federal Transport Minister VolkerWissing (FDP) has warned of drastic cuts for motorists – including weekend driving bans.This is according to a letter from Wissing to the heads of the SPD, Green and FDP parliamentary factions. It was made available to the Deutsche Presse-Agentur on Thursday …

The letter states that if the amended Climate Protection Act does not come into force before 15 July, the ministry will be obliged under the current law to present an action programme to ensure compliance with the annual emission levels for the transport sector in the coming years.

And just like that, the climatists are falling all over themselves to reassure Germans that no, don’t worry, driving is fine,nobody wants to take away your cars:

The Federal Environmental Agency believes [driving bans are] unnecessary.“Of course we don’t need driving bans. Nobody is even discussing such a ban; this is frightening people for no reason,”said [Green-affiliated] President Dirk Messner. Instead, he once again suggested a general speed limit on German motorways …

There is more, there is always more:

The SPD also criticised the proposal:“Scaremongering with far-fetched proposals won’t help climate protection in the transport sector at all, quite the contrary,”SPD Bundestag faction leader Detlef Müller said … “The proposal does not further our common goal of reducing CO2 emissions, but to unnecessary uncertainty for people in our country.” The SPD Bundestag faction clearly rejects driving bans for cars and lorries. Such manoeuvres would hardly advance the ongoing deliberations on the Climate Protection Act in the Bundestag, said Müller.

I like this paragraph so much that I’ve read it five times.

It’s just so entertaining to read some right-thinking lunatic like Müller insisting up and down that literally banning driving “does not further our common goal of reducing CO2 emissions.”

Along with the Green Party and Greenpeace, the environmental organisation BUND has also criticised Wissing’s statements on the threat of driving bans. BUND transport expert Jens Hilgenberg said:

“It fits the picture that this minister, of all people, who blocks every measure, no matter how easy to implement, such as a speed limit on motorways, is now playing on people’s fears.”

He is only doing so to further increase the pressure on the coalition partners, Hilgenberg says. “This is a shabby tactic.”

We must add avoiding political suicide to the long and growing list of things–from the rights of Palestinians to the threat posed by “disinformation” to third-world poverty– that are more important than climate change. This is becoming a very long list indeed.

So what are the solutions, if we’re not going to ban driving on weekends, and the Greens insist on blocking reforms to the Climate Protection Act? Well, aside from the speed limit, which has the same attraction for the left in Germany as banning guns does for the left in the United States (and about equal chances of achieving any of the stated goals), the experts have nothing but the same tired nostrums: We need more public transit! We need more electromobility! We need more expansions to the electric vehicle charging networks!The problem is not only that none of this amounts to an “action programme” to sink vehicle emissions posthaste; it is also that there is no money for any of this.Electric vehicle subsidies have been withdrawnsince the courts blew a 60 billion dollar hole in the government’s budget. Far from expanding public transit, we’re fighting to maintain the decaying rail network we already have. And nobody believes that more charging stations will save the planet.

This is late-stage climatism and it will linger for a long time.

There await years if not decades of haggling over the ambitious goals set by past governments,years of fig leafs and excuses, years of relaxing restrictions in elaborate ways so we can pretend we’re still doing something.

It is going to be very tedious, but also, I suspect, occasionally entertaining.

To see how big companies have become from a human perspective,Visual Capitalist's Marcus Lu visualizedthe top U.S. companies by employees. These figures come fromcompaniesmarketcap.com, and were accessed in March 2024. Note that this ranking includes publicly-traded companies only.

The data we used to create this list of largest U.S. corporations by number of employees can be found in the table below.

Companies likeWalmart,Target, andKrogerhave a massive headcount due to having many locations spread across the country, which require everything from cashiers to IT professionals.

Moving goods around the world is also highly labor intensive, explaining whyUPShas half a million employees globally.

Two companies that rank among the largest U.S. corporations by employees which may be less familiar to the public includeConcentrixandCognizant. Both of these companies are B2B brands, meaning they primarily work with other companies rather than consumers. This contrasts with brands like Amazon or Home Depot, which are much more visible among average consumers.

Warren Buffett’s company doesn’t directly employ 383,000 people. This headcount actually includes the employees of the firm’s many subsidiaries, such asGEICO(insurance),Dairy Queen(retail), andDuracell(batteries).

2024-04-16 07:20:00,Central Banks Are Wrong About Rate-Cuts,https://web.archive.org/web/20240416123035/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/central-banks-are-wrong-about-rate-cuts,"Authored by Daniel Lacalle,

When we talk about monetary policy,people do not understand the importance of interest rates reflecting the reality of inflation and risk. Interest rates are the price of risk and manipulating them down leads to bubbles that end in financial crises, while imposing too high rates can penalize the economy. Ideally, interest rates would flow freely and there would be no central bank to fix them.

A price signal as important as interest rates or the amount of money would prevent the creation of bubbles and, above all, the disproportionate accumulation of risk. The risk of fixing rates too high does not exist when central banks impose reference rates, as they will always make it easier for state borrowing—artificial currency creation—in the most convenient—what they call “no distortions”—and cheap way.

Many analysts say that central banks do not impose interest rates; they only reflect what the market demands.Surprisingly, if that were the case, we wouldn’t have financial traders stuck to screens on a Thursday waiting to decipher what the rate decision is going to be. Moreover, if the central bank only responds to market demand, it is a good reason to let interest rates float freely.

Citizens perceive that raising interest rates with high inflation is harmful; however, they do not seem to understand that what was really destructive was having negative real and nominal interest rates.That’s what encourages economic agents to take far more risks than we can take and to disguise excess debt with a false sense of security. At the same time, it is surprising that citizens praise low rates but then complain that home prices and risky assets rise too fast.

Inflation is a huge advantage for the currency issuer. It blames everyone and everybody for the rise in prices, except for the only thing that makes aggregate prices go up, consolidate that increase, and continue to rise, even at a more moderate rate: printing much more currency than the private economy demands and setting rates well below the real risk levels.

The benefit of statism is that it puts the blame for high interest rates on banks, just as it blames supermarkets for consumer prices.

Who prints currency and disguises risk?

Of course, we look at the ECB and the Fed, who dictate the increase in money supply through repurchases and fixed interest rates. However,central banks do not buy back state assets, print money, or impose negative real interest rates because they are evil alchemists. They do so because the state’s deficit—which is artificial monetary creation—remains unsustainable, public debt is atrophied, and state solvency is worsened by imbalanced public accounts.The central bank is not responsible for implementing fiscal policy. Thus, the state is the one that prints money out of nowhere and passes the imbalance to the citizens through inflation and taxes.

Banks, in an open economy, do not create money out of nowhere; they lend to real projects that are expected to be repaid with interest, and those loans have collateral. If commercial banks created money out of nowhere, none of them would go bankrupt. They only create money out of nowhere when regulation imposes risk-disconnected rates and eliminates the need for capital to sustain the government by accumulating its bonds and loans under the false construction that they are “no-risk assets.” Thus, the castle of cards built under the disguise of public sector risk always creates inflation, financial crises, secular stagnation, and liquidity traps. The amount of money created goes to unproductive expenditure, destroys the purchasing power of the currency, impoverishes citizens, and at the same time decapitalizes the most fragile companies, SMEs (small and medium enterprises).That’s what they call the social use of money. Seriously.

The ECB has announced a possible interest rate cut in June that is in danger of being premature and wrong. First, because money supply, credit demand, and supply are rebounding, inflation remains persistent and above the 2% target. Furthermore, the underlying trend is a much higher inflation level than the ECB’s target, even after two changes in the CPI calculation. After a 20% accumulated consumer price level since 2019, calling victory on inflation after two changes in the calculation of CPI and still elevated core inflation is insane. If we see the rise in non-replaceable goods prices, we can understand why citizens are angry. Real non-replaceable goods’ CPI is probably closer to 4-5% per year.

The ECB rate hikes are signaled by many market participants as the cause of the euro zone’s stagnation, but curiously, no one mentions that the euro area was already experiencing massive stagnation due to negative interest rates.Besides, if you need to have real negative rates to “grow,” you’re not growing but accumulating toxic risk. The ECB knows that the base effect, which played in favor of year-on-year inflation in 2023, will not be supportive in 2024. They also know that monetary aggregates were down a few months ago but are rebounding, and that the supply of credit has not collapsed. The ECB, like the Federal Reserve, knows that inflation is a monetary phenomenon and that there is no cost-push inflation, “greedflation,” or similar statist excuses. None of those factors can cause aggregate prices to soar, consolidate, or continue to rise; it is only the destruction of the currency’s purchasing power that causes inflation.

Of course, no central bank will acknowledge that inflation is its fault, among other things, because no central bank increases the money supply at will but to finance an unsustainable public deficit. However, no central bank will challenge a financial structure that is based on the myth that public debt is risk-free. Central banks know that inflation is a monetary phenomenon, which is why they attack rising consumer prices with rate hikes and money supply reductions. They just do it mildly because governments benefit from inflation.

The problem of lowering interest rates now, when there is no evidence of having controlled inflation and achieved a target that already erodes the purchasing power of the currency by 2% annually, is to fall into the narrative that the eurozone is in a poor economic situation because of monetary policy when it is due to the wrong fiscal policy, the disaster of the Next Generation EU Funds, whose failure is already only comparable to the forgotten Juncker Plan, a shortsighted and destructive energy, agricultural, and industrial policy, and a taxation system that shifts innovation and technology to other countries.

The ECB is aware that interest rates are not high and that the system’s money supply has not decreased as expected. In fact, it continues to repurchase outstanding bonds and will not carry out a significant reduction in its balance sheet in real terms until the end of the year. Lowering interest rates now includes the risk of depreciating the euro against the dollar and thus increasing the euro area’s import bill in real terms, reducing the inflow of reserves into the eurozone, and further encouraging public spending and government debt that has not been contained in countries like Italy and Spain, which boast of “growing” by massively increasing debt and where inflation, moreover, is not under control. All this reminds us of the mistakes of the past when Greece boasted to be the EU’s growth engine, and many said that Germany was Europe’s “sick member.”

The ECB cannot pretend to be the Bank of Japan for two reasons:the eurozone lacks the luxury of Japanese society’s dollar savings structure or its iron citizen discipline, and, above all, because the failure of Japan’s ultra-Keynesianism has brought the yen to a 35-year low against the dollar.

To those who say that the euro and the ECB are the problem, I recommend that you exercise your imagination of what Spain, Portugal, or Italy would be with their own currency and populist governments printing as if Argentina were Switzerland. You don’t have to imagine it; remember when these countries had an inflation rate of 14–15% and they destroyed savings and real wages with the falsehood of “competitive” devaluations? Not that long ago.

Don’t be fooled. The eurozone is not weak due to monetary policy. The eurozone is weak even with monetary policy.

2024-04-16 08:04:34,Morgan Stanley Shares Rebound On Strong Revenues,https://web.archive.org/web/20240416123035/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/morgan-stanley-shares-rebound-strong-revenues#comment-stream,"Morgan Stanley shares are quickly recovering from last week's mauling (after WSJ reported regulatory probes of how the bank handles wealth management clients “who are at risk of laundering money""), this morning after reporting Q1 wealth management and equities trading revenue that beat expectations.

Net revenue $15.14 billion,estimate $14.46 billion(Bloomberg Consensus)

Wealth management net revenue $6.88 billion, estimate $6.69 billion(Net new assets in the division, a key metric tracked by Morgan Stanley watchers, were $95 billion, higher than the previous two quarters combinedand in excess of what the bank needs to meet the target it has sought to grow the business).

Equities sales & trading revenue $2.84 billion, estimate $2.65 billion(less than Goldman Sachs' $3.31 billion in the same period).

FICC sales & trading revenue $2.49 billion, estimate $2.33 billion

Institutional Investment Banking revenue $1.45 billion, estimate $1.34 billion

Advisory revenue $461 million, -28% y/y, estimate $510.1 million,due, of course, to “lower completed M&A transactions.”

Equity underwriting rev. $430 million vs. $202 million y/y, estimate $326.3 million

Fixed Income Underwriting revenue $556 million, +37% y/y, estimate $505.8 million

Under the hood,equity net revenues were up 4% from a year agothanks to “solid results across business lines and regions, with notable strength in derivatives against a constructive market backdrop.”

On the flip side,fixed income’s net revenues fell 4% from a year ago“on lower client activity in macro and credit, partially offset by higher revenues in commodities.”

But overall, traders liked what they saw, sending MS shares up around 3% in the pre-market...

Additionally the firm delivered what it calls""strong"" ROTCE of 19.7%.

“In the first quarter of 2024 Morgan Stanley generated net revenues of $15 billion and earnings of $2.02 per share for a 20% return on tangible equity,"" said freshly appointed CEO Ted Pick.

""As a result of strong net new asset growth, the Firm has reached $7 trillion of client assets across Wealth and Investment Management. Institutional Securities also saw strength across the markets and underwriting businesses. The Morgan Stanley Integrated Firm model is delivering durable results.”

But, net interest income fell, “driven by changes in deposit mix,” though that was “partially offset by the impact of interest rates.”

As a reminder,the bank’s stock has been the worst performer among the biggest US banks so far this yearafter outpacing rivals through much of the previous decade.

2024-04-16 08:15:00,"NSA ""Just Days Away From Taking Over The Internet"" Warns Ed Snowden",https://web.archive.org/web/20240416123035/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/nsa-just-days-away-taking-over-internet-warns-ed-snowden,"Authored by Tom Mitchelhill via CoinTelegraph.com,

The United States National Security Agency (NSA) isonly days away from “taking over the internet” with a massive expansion of its surveillance powers, according to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.

In an April 16 post to X, Snowden drew attention to a thread originally posted by Elizabeth Goitein — the co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice — that warned of a new bill that could see the U.S. government surveillance powers amplified to new levels.

Source:Edward Snowden

The bill in question reforms and extends a part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) known as Section 702.

Currently, the NSA can force internet service providers such as Google and Verizon to hand over sensitive data concerning NSA targets.

However, Goitein claims that through an “innocuous change” to the definition of “electronic communications surveillance provider” in the FISA 702 bill, the U.S. government could go far beyond its current scope and force nearly every company and individual that provides any internet-related service to assist with NSA surveillance.

Additionally, the people forced to hand over data would be unable to discuss the information provided due to hefty gag order penalties and conditions outlined in the bill, added Goitein.

Source:Elizabeth Goitein

The bill initially received heavy pushback from privacy-conscious Republicans butpassedthrough the U.S. House of Representatives on April 13.

Part of the pushback saw the bills’ proposed spying powers time-frame cut from five years to two years, as well as some minor amendments to the service providers included under the surveillance measures.

However, according to Goitein, the amendment did very little to reduce the scope of surveillance granted to the NSA.

In her view, the amendment could even see service providers such as cleaners, plumbers and IT service providers that have access to laptops and routers inside people’s homes be forced to provide information and serve as “surrogate spies,” claimed Goitein.

The bill has seen strong pushback from both sides of the political aisle, with several government representatives claiming the bill violates citizen’s constitutional rights.

Democratic Senator Ron Wydendescribedthe bill as “terrifying” and said he would do everything in his power to prevent it from being passed through the Senate.

Republican Congressperson Anna Paulina Luna, who voted against the bill in the House of Representatives, said Section 702 was an “irresponsible extension” of the NSA’s powers. Luna added that if government agencies wanted access to data, they must be forced to apply for a warrant.

The bill is slated for a vote on April 19 in the U.S. Senate.

2024-04-16 15:33:53,The Left's Civil War Over Israel,https://web.archive.org/web/20240417131600/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-16/lefts-civil-war-over-israel,"Yesterday, Shai Davidai, an Israeli professor at Columbia Business School, posted a thread on X with video of anti-Israel protests in New York that disturbed him.

Of course, many of these anti-Israel protestors were Muslim immigrants. Ironically, Professor Davidai publisheda studya couple of years ago, arguing that immigration wasn't zero-sum, and so Americans need not worry about demographic change. It appears that he was wrong.

Maybe immigration is zero sum after all.https://t.co/SVOpHIZqxGpic.twitter.com/N4Kfvatkab

As our friend Kevin Dolan points out below, demographic change including Muslim immigration has broken the left's coalition, and with the explosion of social media, the instruments of narrative control that might have papered over their differences in the past no longer work. Before we get to that, a brief trading note.

If you're concerned about the potential impact of an Israeli strike on Iran on your portfolio, as a reminder, you can scan usethe Portfolio Armor web appto hedge your downside risk. We're also going to be on the lookout for buying opportunities created by the current uncertainty, which we will share on our trading Substack. You can subscribe to that using the link below (we're using that for our occasional emails now).

Now on to Kevin's excellent post.

Authored by Kevin Dolan at EXIT

There’s an air of boring inevitability about what is happening in the Middle East. As much as secular RW guys complain about the Christian admonition to turn the other cheek, the conflict in Israel is basically what it looks like when the cultural and technological capacity to call up grievances is unbounded: not only an endless grind of reprisals, but one in which both parties have to keep up a continual show of injured righteousness.

The most powerful tool in the mass media arsenal is the privilege to define when history begins — who “fired the first shot”, and therefore who is the aggressor and the villain.

The Israeli/Palestinian conflict was already one of the most litigated conflicts in human history because of the fault lines it revealed in the American media establishment, and ordinary Americans have long regarded it with exhaustion.

But they could still get exercised about terrorist massacres, because these were unprovoked, and targeted innocent people. Only academic leftists endorsed terror tactics against civilian “colonizers”, and even some of these made an unprincipled exception for Israel.

Now, for both ideological and demographic reasons (there are a lot more Muslims in the European and American Left than there used to be), the coalition has broken down, and many leftists’ definitions of ""unprovoked” and “innocent” have changed.

But it’s not just the Left’s civil war over Jewish victimhood vs. “black and brown bodies’” victimhood — instruments of narrative control are failing across the board.

Despite Putin invading Ukraine foressentially the same reasons Hitler invaded Poland, the national security establishment has struggled to get Americans interested. Accusations of Bashar al-Assad “gassing his own people” don’t land like they did on Saddam Hussein in the 1990s.

Waving the bloody shirt just doesn’t work the way it used to.

In Ukraine, the most successful propaganda portrays the “good guys” as theperpetratorsof the violence, with viewers invited to relish a Russian infantryman’s helplessness and horror as a grenade is dropped on him.

There are, of course, stories of displaced orphaned Ukrainian children with tuberculosis, and maimed Ukrainian boys in the prime of life, but that isn’t what plays anymore. What the NAFO boys really want to see is (good) faceless machines vivisecting (bad) huddling kids, and puff pieces about how Ukrainians arewinning the war against Slavic gender norms.

Unlimited access to data and contrary perspectives means that no one gets to decide where history begins. Every grievance is placed within a novel framework by opposing partisans, complicated or contextualized or “problematized” into oblivion.

Most of what is categorized as ""Russian disinformation” is just this kind of thing, but the state is right to fear it — not because it’s true or false, but precisely because it reveals the incoherence of “true” and “false” as labels for a narrative.

In a sense, the dream of the 90s internet was realized — we all got unfettered access to all the Facts we could stand — but we learned that the postmodernists were right. There really is no outside-text, nothing to tell you what is the proper configuration of the facts.

For example, nothing inVladimir Putin’s monologue on medieval Russian historywas a lie — the question is which facts, if any, are morally relevant to the present, which is a question whose answer cannot be divined from the facts themselves.

The superabundance of information, and the accompanying vast marketplace of narratives, doesn’t mean that people are any more sophisticated or curious than they used to be. In fact, it means almost the opposite.

If you’re a rank-and-file political partisan on any issue, and you’ve just seen some enemy propaganda that is making you nervous, you have instant access to the smartest apologists in the world, who have thought about your issue longer than you have, who can place that disturbing story into a familiar context, and put your mind at ease.

And now we have the prospect ofAI-generated charred infant remains. Not only are we unable to form a shared interpretation of the facts, we are increasingly unable to trust the facts themselves.

I think Ben Shapiro was genuinely shocked by the resistance he faced as he presented photographic evidence of the carnage on October 7th, but it was inevitable.

Guys like Jackson Hinkle aren’t really “skeptics” in any general, principled way, of course — but there is no longer any way to represent facts that is not vulnerable to this kind of gainsaying. Every form of evidence that defines our episteme is now falsifiable.

We are returning, psychologically, to the medieval village, in which you “know” only what you’ve experienced, and you believe a few trusted reports, and anything else you might hear about the outside world is held very loosely.

This will make it increasingly difficult to rally large groups of people around universalizing moral causes that don’t concern them directly. It will also break the false notion that the whole world is known, mapped, disenchanted territory — which is the basis for the Death of God.

All of this will be very healthy, for most people, eventually — but in the meantime, we are facing a massiveselection event.

As the colossal public organs of fact-accumulation, sense-making, and consensus-building becomeclogged with ever-more convincing and unfilterable simulacra, your grip on reality will be a matter of your connection with God, and with other sane, honest, competent people. Your survival will depend on your capacity, and your tribe’s capacity, to resist these simulacra, and insist on what is human and real.

It will be impossible to do this if you remain dependent on captured infrastructure to provide you with information, income, security, and status. We are building something new on the outside. Join us atexitgroup.us.

On Tuesday night’s group call we discussed“building while the world ends”. Several of the guys discussed how they are investing capital, shoring up their spiritual and family life, and building skills that will be useful across the broadest range of possible futures.

On tonight’s full-group call we will be having ahot seatfor a young man considering marriage — a discussion of how family culture is developed and maintained, and the domains in which alignment is most critical.

This week we had our firstinvestment call, in which the day traders in the group shared their heavily-disclaimed thoughts on the oil industry and other commodities for entertainment purposes only.

One of our guys has beenproducing a filmwith an investor pool in the group for the last two and a half years. They just finished shooting this week in Kentucky. Very excited to see where it goes next.

If all of this sounds like a fever-dream case of déjà vu, that’s because it’s essentially a play-by-play repeat of the synthesis of COVID-19 and all of the ensuing chaos and disease and economic and social devastation that ensued:

·       A rogue U.S. agency offshores research it is banned from performing itself on American soil to unaccountable Third World labs, using public money to fund it

·       Said unaccountable Third World labs recklessly experiment with gain-of-function research to create chimeric viruses capable of infecting humans, at ever-increasing clips of infectiousness and deadliness

·       Multinational pharmaceutical firms ready “vaccines” in the pipeline, ready to be deployed on the public to unprecedented windfalls once the shoe drops

Related:COVID Propaganda: Your Definitive Guide to Bird Flu Terror

ViaWhite Coat Waste Project:

“In February, a White Coat Waste Project (WCW) investigation exposed howthe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has wasted at least $1 million of taxpayers’ money on an ongoing collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party-controlled Chinese Academy of Sciences(the Wuhan animal lab’s parent organization) and a Wuhan lab white coaton dangerous bird flu gain-of-function experiments.

Now,a group of 18 Republican and Democratic Congress members is demanding answersin a letter to Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.

In the letter spearheaded by Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-NY), who serves on the House Agriculture Committee, the lawmakers cite WCW’s recent investigation and write, ‘We are disturbed by recent reports about the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-linked Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) on bird flu research.This research, funded by American taxpayers, could potentially generate dangerous new lab-created virus strains that threaten our national security and public health.’”

What follows is an excerpt ofRepresentative Langworthy’s letter to the USDA chiefwhich concludes with a call for transparency and oversight over these experiments:

“We are disturbed by recent reports about the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-linked Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) on bird flu research. This research, funded by American taxpayers, could potentially generate dangerous new lab-created virus strains that threaten our national security and public health.

TheUSDA-CAS joint projectdescription states that itentails ‘in vivo passage of viruses through mallard ducks and Chinese goose species to predict evolution in natural hosts,’ ‘viral evolution and transmission dynamics of avian influenza virus (AIV) infectionin Japanese quail as an indicator species ofpotential to jump into mammalian hosts,’and experiments with ‘highly pathogenic avian influenza.’…

Regarding the role of CAS in this potentially dangerous research collaboration, USDA explains: ‘The work will involve...wet-lab virology, both in vitro and in vivo...The collaborators at the Chinese Academy of Sciences will...perform in vivo and vitro fitness measurements...Chinese Academy of Science will provide molecular virology expertise.’One of the key CAS collaborators in this USDA program has a recent affiliation with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).”

Dovetailing with these revelations, CDC Director Mandy Cohen recently bragged to NPR that the agency has bird flu “vaccine candidates that are ready to go” just as soon as the government can parlay bird flu terror disseminated via the corporate state media into new lockdowns designed to hold the economy hostage until they get “shots in arms,” as they like to stay — a virtually identical replay, again, of COVID-19, only perhaps with (they hope) a much deadlier pathogen that would make enforcing mandates easier… the fatal flaw of the COVID regime being that the virus turned out to be not deadly at all save for a tiny subset of the population with multiple co-morbidities. What they really need this go-around, accordingly, is an engineered virus with a kill rate 100x or more that of COVID to get the compliance where it needs to be for the full-throated biomedical surveillance state to sink its teeth in.

“’The CDC says the risk to humans from the H5N1 flu that is driving this outbreak is low,’ NPR host Ari Shapiro toldCDC Director Mandy Cohenon Wednesday. ‘Right now, it appears that the two cases in humans were from contact with sick animals. Do you have any reason to believe that humans could pass this on to each other?’

‘So we have never seen a case of human-to-human spread of avian flu here in the United States, and the version of avian flu that we’re seeing in cattle and in this one human case is the same strain that we have seen previously in birds,’ Cohen replied. ‘We’ve never seen that spread human to human.’

‘That all being said,’she added, ‘as we’ve learned through COVID and our experiences, viruses change, and we need to stay ahead of it. That’s why we at CDC and the whole of U.S. government is taking this very seriouslyand monitoring the situation very closely.’…

‘The good news is the United States has been preparing for avian flu outbreaks for more than 20 years,’ Cohen said. ‘We’ve invested in our ability to test for this, to prevent it and to treat it. And we know that the strain we’re seeing right now is the same strain we have seen before. Tests will pick this up.’

‘Our treatment, which is Tamiflu, which we have both doses in stockpile and around the country, works,’she said. ‘And we even have vaccine candidates that are ready to go. So it’s very different than what we experienced, for example, at the beginning of COVID, when we were seeing a brand-new, novel virus where we didn’t have tests, we didn’t have treatment and we didn’t have vaccine.’”

2024-04-17 02:00:00,US Push For A 'Middle East NATO' Failed To Emerge During Iran Strikes,https://web.archive.org/web/20240417131600/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/us-push-middle-east-nato-failed-emerge-during-iran-strikes#comment-stream,"The Islamic Republic’s Saturday attack on Israel was a made-for social media moment. It was also theultimate test of US efforts to cobble together a coalition of Arab states and Israel in a so-called Middle East NATO, to jointly defend an attack from Tehran.

Israel, the US, France, the UK, and Jordan managed to intercept around99 percentof the drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles fired at Israel by Iran in retaliation for an attack on its embassy in Damascus, Syria. Radar and early warning systems that the US maintains at its military bases across the Gulf were instrumental in tracking the slow-moving armada of missiles and drones, current and former US, Israeli and Arab officials told MEE, adding that the US was able to scramble jet fighters from Saudi Arabia and Qatar at the last minute to particpate in the operation.

But in the end,the oil-rich Gulf states downplayed any involvement and left the heavy lifting of fighting off Iran’s attack to the US, its western allies and Jordan, the resource-poor Hashemite Kingdom dependent on US financial assistance.

For its part, Jordan cast its role actively downing Iranian drones as self-defense and not related to protecting Israel.  “There was unprecedented cooperation between Israel, the US and the Jordanians,” Michael Milshtein, a former Israeli military intelligence officer, told Middle East Eye.“But calling this a coalition is an illusion.”

Middle East Eyereportedon Friday that theGulf monarchies were shutting down US options to launch strikes against Iran in the event Washington felt the need to retaliateagainst Tehran’s attack on Israel. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, and Kuwait all scrutinized their basing agreements with Washington to do the bare minimum that was required and avoid being involved in direct strikes on Iranian targets.

Bilal Saab, a former US Department of Defence official, now at Chatham House, told MEE that the Gulf states’ calibrated actions underscored the limits of the Biden administration's push for a Middle East Nato. “When we start seeing authorizations to use Gulf airspace to launch strikes on Iranian targets, then we can start talking about a Middle East Nato.Right now, it's the exact opposite,” he said.

“I think what we saw from Saturday’s attack pumps the breaks on any idea of an Arab and Israeli Nato.”

As the dust from Saturday’s attack settles, the way regional states responded in the lead-up to the assault is becoming a new battleground between Tehran on one hand, and the US and Israel on the other - that has little to do with the Palestinians but rather the bigger question of who calls the shots in the Middle East.

The Biden administration and Israel are keen to cast Israel’s successful defense as the byproduct of a united front of allies, including Arab states.Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gatz praised the “regional cooperation” that allowed Israel to defend itself.

Successful coordination with Arab states would allow Israel to present Saturday as a strategic win, which could help reduce tensions by lessening the need for a more forceful Israeli response, according to analysts. “What this weekend demonstrated is that Israel did not have to and does not have to defend itself alone when it is the victim of an aggression, the victim of an attack,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday.

For its part,the Islamic Republic’s goal is to isolate Israel, preventing any cooperation between them and Gulf states. “It’s a total propaganda war right now,” Aziz Alghashian, a Saudi analyst and expert on ties between Israel and Gulf states told MEE.

Tehran and Washington are already sparring over whether advance notice of the attack on Israel was given.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said that Tehran gave the US about 72 hours prior notice of the attack through “our friends and neighbours”. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal appeared to confirm that claim,reportingthat Iran briefed officials from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states on its attack. Turkish officials also told MEE that Turkey, a member of Nato, was briefed on the attack days in advance.The US, however, denied it was given a days-long heads up before the assault.

Julien Barnes-Dacey, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told MEE that an Iranian leak to Gulf states would logically be passed on to the US because Arab rulers are afraid a deadly Iranian strike on Israel could spark a wider war, which Iran hoped to avoid.

“Jordan and the Arab Gulf states are first and foremost concerned about preventing regional escalation,"" he told MEE. “I don’t see this as Gulf states doubling down on a strategic alignment with Israel. They are going to keep talking with Iran to prevent an unravelling that they fear will suck them all in.”

To be sure, the Arab Gulf states are linked more closely with Israel today than any time in history, and Israel’s war on Gaza has not led the UAE or Bahrain to rip up the 2020 Abraham Accords which saw them normalise ties with Tel Aviv.

As part of that agreement, Israel was also absorbed into Centcom, the US’s overall central command in the Middle East. Israeli military officials were even dispatched to Qatar’s Al Udeid Air Base, MEE previouslyreported, but it's not clear if those officials are still in the country.

But Saturday’s attack on Israel underscored the US’s limited success in fostering closer security cooperation between Israel and the Gulf states, Milshtein, the former Israeli military intelligence officer, told MEE. Gulf states have no love lost for Iran, but arewary of what they believe to be the US’s waning influence in the region and limited appetite to come to their defense, as Washington did for Israel. The US did not retaliate to the 2019 attack on Saudi Arabia’s Aramco oil facilities that was blamed to have been backed by Iran.

The Gulf states' frustration with the US only grew when the Biden administration took office. Biden and members of his party criticised Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over human rights issues. Saudi Arabia and the UAE also viewed the administration’s response to Houthi missile and drone attacks as tepid.

In response, they moved to patch up ties with Tehran. In April 2023, the UAE appointed its first new ambassador to the Islamic Republic after seven years. Saudi Arabia and Tehran normalised ties in a deal brokered by China.

""Most of the Arab states promoted reconciliation with Iran because they couldn’t rely on Biden’s administration,” Milshtein said.“They preferred to deal with Iran and not the Americans”

Saab, at Chatham House, said to achieve true regional coordination between Israel and the Gulf states, Washington would need to provide concrete security guarantees. Saudi Arabia has requested such support, along with new weapons systems, as part of a deal to normalise ties with Israel, but those talks are stalled as Israel pounds the Gaza Strip. “The last thing the Gulf is going to do is provoke Iran and not have the backing of the Americans,” Saab said.

Alghashian said Saturday’s attack on Israellikely reaffirmed Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman’s decision to restore ties with Tehran. He said Riyadh’s goal is to “stay out of the way” of tensions between Israel and Iran as it pursues its economic development. “The strategic value of restoring ties with Tehran is paying dividends,” he said.

As Statista's Anna Fleck shows in the chart below,this equates toapproximately 31 percent of global hydropowerthat year.

Following some way behind comes Brazil (427 TWh), Canada (398 TWh), the United States (249 TWh) and Russia (198 TWh).

When looking athydropower’s share of total electricity production for each of these countries,then Norway comes first with a high 87.5 percent of its electricity energy mix having been accounted for by hydropower in 2022. Only Paraguay comes higher in terms of share of total electricity production, at 99.7 percent. If this chart were extended, it would feature in rank 15.

You will find more infographics atStatista

As this chart shows,Indiawas the sixth biggest hydropower worldwide in 2022 with approximately 175 TWh of hydropower generated that year, which accounted for 9.4 percent of the country’s electricity production.

According to Ember, fossil fuels accounted for more than three quarters (77 percent) of India’s electricity production in 2022.

This was mostly from coal (74 percent), followed by gas (2.7 percent).India’semissions are driven by this dependence on fossil fuels as well as its large population, althoughper capita emissionsare low.

The country has set a target of increasing the share of non-fossil fuel sources in its electricity generation capacity to 50 percent by 2030.

2024-04-17 03:30:00,Polling Shows How Massively Unpopular Scotland's 'Hate Crime' Law Is,https://web.archive.org/web/20240417131600/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/polling-shows-how-massively-unpopular-scotlands-hate-crime-law#comment-stream,"Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news,

A new YouGovpoll has found that Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf’s popularity has nosedived since the introduction of ridiculous the hate crime law that caused police to receive over 8000 reports in one week.

The Telegraph reports thatYousaf now has an approval rating of minus 32, equating to a 15-point drop for since the beginning of the year.

The report notes that even among people who voted for his Party, more believe he is doing a poor job than those who think he is doing well.

📉 Humza Yousaf’s popularity with Scottish voters has plummeted following the introduction of his new hate crime laws, a new poll has revealedhttps://t.co/0nyft85KBf

Just 29 per cent of Scottish National Party voters believe Yousaf is doing a good job, while 36 per cent think he has been poor in office.

Consequently, Yousaf’s popularity among his own voters is now minus seven, down from plus 14 in January, a massive drop.

The leading pollster, Sir John Curtice commented that the results showed that the First Minister is “deeply and increasingly unpopular”.

It seems that JK Rowling was right when she predicted that Yousaf will “get his richly deserved comeuppance” when Scottish people vote.

Yousaf also now faces increased calls among Scottish Conservatives to hold a vote that would to repeal the “disastrous” law, as police cannot cope with the increased workload.

🔵 Humza Yousaf faces Tory vote to repeal hate crime lawhttps://t.co/ICFfjlzeSr

The 8000 hate crime reports in the first week vastly outnumber all other weekly reports of significant crimes combined, including  assault, vandalism and drug possession.

The initial 8000 complaints is also more than the annual total of all hate crime reports for all previous years.

Calum Steele, the former general secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, commented that officers “are genuinely embarrassed. They feel that the service and by extension [they] as individual police officers will catch some of the public brunt.”

As we have previously noted, Yousaf’s infamous ‘anti-white’ rant in front of the Scottish Parliament on the 11th of June 2020 has been repeatedly reported to police under the new law by those opposed to the new legislation.

Yousaf himself has declared that anyone reporting his speech as a potential hate crime is “far right.”

To top this all off, staff working for Police Scotland are being told to read a pre-prepared transcript defending Yousaf when people call to report him under the odious new law.

Under the new legislation, anyone deemed to have been verbally ‘abusive’, in person or online, to a transgender person, including “insulting” them could be hit with a prison sentence of up to seven years.

2024-04-17 05:00:00,Ukraine's Opposition To The Assimilation Of Its Refugees Is Extremely Hypocritical,https://web.archive.org/web/20240417131600/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/ukraines-opposition-assimilation-its-refugees-extremely-hypocritical,"Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

This is the opposite of how Ukraine treats its indigenous Russian minority...

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kulebawarnedon Friday that“It has become clear that assimilation would be extremely fast if we do not change our policy towards Ukrainians abroad”,calling on these refugees to“remain Ukrainian” with the innuendo that they shouldn’t plant roots in the West.

He didn’t explicitly say so, but it’s strongly hinted that he hopes that thosemillionswho’ve fled the latest phase of the Ukrainian Conflict over the past two years will eventually return home to their country.

Kiev-based economist Alexey Kushchsaidin an interview with Ukrainian journalist Yury Romanenko last week that“I estimate that [after the conflict is over] Ukraine’s demographic profile <...> will be made up of 25 million people, including ten million senior citizens, five million children and two to three million disabled persons and veterans receiving social benefits. About seven to eight million working adults will make up the core of the economy.”

These two developments coincided with Ukraine’s passing of a new conscription law that doesn’t include a demobilization clause, which the media reported has left troops feeling “betrayed”while a member of the Rada described it as a “point of no return” in terms ofturning citizens against the government. Kuleba obviously hopes that unassimilated Ukrainians will feel so unwelcome in the West that they’ll return home torisk their lives in the meatgrinderand then rebuild their country when the conflict ends.

Basically, he’s manipulating them on a faux “patriotic” pretext into creating problems for themselves abroad so that they’ll consider moving back to Ukraine, but his rhetoric is extremely hypocritical since it’s the opposite of how Kiev itself treats minorities.

It was observed that “The West Would Never Talk About Its Minorities The Way That Ukraine Talks About Its Russian One” after Rada speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk denied their very existence and associated rights last fall.

In other words, Kuleba wants Ukrainian refugees not to assimilate into their host societies, with a wink and a nod that they should exploit theliberal-globalistWest’s related legislation and socio-cultural norms to preserve their culture as much as possible.

At the same time, Stefanchuk denies the existence of Ukraine’s indigenous Russian minority, thus depriving them of any rights and therefore creating the exact same situation inside of Ukraine that Kuleba hopes that his country’s own refugees avoid.

These are blatant double standards, but they’re unlikely to be discussed but the Mainstream Media since these organizations have an interest in covering up for Ukraine’s fascist policies, which is exactly what Kiev is practicing.

There’s nothing wrong with refugees or immigrants retaining their identity, nor with countries promoting assimilationist and integrationist policies, but what belies ulterior ideological motives is having double standards when it comes to one’s own group and country.

2024-04-17 05:25:00,"RFK Jr Won't Pursue Libertarian Nomination, Says Team Trump Asked Him To Be VP",https://web.archive.org/web/20240417131600/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/rfk-jr-wont-pursue-libertarian-nomination-says-team-trump-asked-him-be-vp,"After seriouslyconsideringthe possibility,2024 presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy, Jr has declared he will not seek the Libertarian Party nomination, saying he's confident he'll achieve ballot access across the country on his own. Meanwhile, in a social media skirmish with Team Trump,Kennedy said Trump associates asked him to consider becoming the former president's running mate.

In a political system with formidable ballot-access barriers that protect the Democrat-Republican duopoly,outsider presidential candidates are frequently attracted to the idea of running as a Libertarian-- if only to access the party's hard-earned, 50-state ballot qualification.

""We're not gonna have any problems getting on the ballot ourselvesso we won't be running Libertarian,"" Kennedy tellsABC News. That declaration came as his team was celebrating their exploitation of a quirk in Iowa ballot-access law: Rather than gathering 3,500 signatures, theKennedy team held a convention in West Des Moines. Consistent with state requirements, it included at least 500 voters who represented at least 25 of the Hawkeye State's 99 counties.

Kennedy assuredABCthat he's ""100% confident"" he'll manage the arduous process -- which includes fending off Democrats' lawfare -- in all 50 states, saying""we're going to add probably two to three states a week.""

While Kennedy framed his decision solely in ballot-access terms,it was far from certain that he could have actually won the Libertarian nod.The nominee isn't selected by party leadership, but by delegates at the group's convention -- all of whom show up fully free to vote for the candidate of their choice. Things can get wild and spontaneous, and not just in a political sense:

Libertarian candidate strips on stage at party convention (VIDEO)https://t.co/xNBkQeZNQMpic.twitter.com/vQqP1SgYnB

Kennedy has plenty of overlaps with libertarians, some of his stances could be seen as disqualifying:

Meanwhile, responding to a series of Truth Social posts by Trump, in which the former president called Kennedy ""the most radical liberal"" in the race,Kennedy said Trump's ""emissaries"" asked him to become his running mate.

President Trump calls me an ultra-left radical. I’m soooo liberal that his emissaries asked me to be his VP. I respectfully declined the offer.I am against President Trump, and President Biden can’t win.Judging by his new website, it looks like President Trump knows who…

Trump's co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita quickly fired back, denying Kennedy's claim and calling him a ""leftie loonie"" to boot...

Re-upping this from January …was true then and it’s true now@RobertfKennedJr….your a leftie loonie that would never be approached to be on the ticket..sorry!https://t.co/Kkti2GOIOS

Politicoreports that Trump had casually floated the idea in conversations, adding that""Trump is known to workshop ideas to a variety of aides and allies, even if they never come to fruition. As he does with many political rivals,Trump has directed a mixture of flattery and abuse at Kennedy-- as hedidlast week:

""He’s got some nice things about him. I happen to like him.Unfortunately he is about the ‘Green New Scam’ because he believes in that and a lot of people don’t.

I guess that would mean that RFK Jr.’s going to be taking away votes from Crooked Joe Biden, and he should because he’s actually better than Biden. He’s much better than Biden.If I were a Democrat, I’d vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden.”

Kennedy's polling at9.3%in theRealClearPoliticsaverage. If nothing else,RFK Jr is a wild card who's causing more worries among Democrats than Republicans.

When Kennedy and third-party options are included in polls, they generally show their presence in the race is a net positive for Trump. In a head-to-head scenario, the RCP average has Trump up0.2%. In a five-person race (which includes Kennedy, Jill Stein and Cornell West), Trump is ahead by1.8%.Recognizing that, Dems have mobilized forces to file legal challenges to his ballot qualifications --you know, in the name of Protecting Our Democracy.

According to Berliner, ""An open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR, and now, predictably,we don’t have an audience that reflects America.""

Berliner says that NPR went sideways when Donald Trump rose to power, as ""what began as tough, straightforward coverage of a belligerent, truth-impaired president veered toward efforts to damage or topple Trump’s presidency.""

What's more,NPR ""hitched our wagon"" to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who ""became NPR's guiding hand, it's ever-present muse.""

By my count, NPR hostsinterviewed Schiff25 times about Trump and Russia. During many of those conversations, Schiff alluded to purported evidence of collusion.The Schiff talking points became the drumbeat of NPR news reports. -Uri Berliner via The Free Press

And now,Berliner has been suspended.

""Senior @NPR editor @uberliner has been suspended from the public radio network he's served for 25 years after sharing concerns about bias in The Free Press,"" the outlet tweeted.

Statista's Felix Richter reports that,according to aYouGov/Economist pollconducted in November 2023,people put the most blame on drug dealers who illegally sell fentanyl,often unbeknownst to the buyers who think they’re purchasing another drug that has been laced with the highly potent and incredibly lethalsynthetic opioid.

You will find more infographics atStatista

Mexico, the main source of the finished drug, comes second on the list of perceived culprits, with China, the main supplier of fentanyl precursors, close behind.

Only slightly fewer people put at least some blame on the federal government, which has so far failed to find a way to effectively stop the flow of fentanyl into the country and subsequently the hands of its citizens.

Fox News reporter Peter Doocy again exposed the failings of the Biden Administration Monday when he asked White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby to explain how Biden can lead effectively when he’s constantly on the beach, whether he regrets unfreezing assets for Iran, and whether he should beef up his posture to more than the word “don’t”.

“Has President Biden considered maybe beefing up the public Iran posture to be more than just one word?” Doocy asked Kirby, who knew instantly what the reporter was referring to.

“You’re referring to, ‘don’t’?”Kirby responded.

“Don’t’ and they did it anyway,”Doocy fired back, adding“So, now what?”

DOOCY TIME: “John, has President Biden considered maybe beefing up the public Iran posture to be more than just one word?”WH’s John Kirby: “You — you’re referring to, ‘don't’?”Doocy: “Yeah.”Kirby: “And so, let's —”Doocy: “Because he said —”Kirby: “— talk about —”…pic.twitter.com/KufejLZFnX

The most alarming thing about this is that it’s his posture on foreign policy in its entirely.

Biden tells WWIII- Don’t 🤣pic.twitter.com/YOStkBM4fq

Doocy continued his line of questioning, asking “Now that we know that the Iranians do not listen to President Biden’s public warnings, is there any regret here about unfreezing billions of dollars for Iranian leaders during the President’s administration?”

Kirby incredibly responded “What unfreezing are you talking about?” as if he had no idea what Doocy was referring to, before going on to attempt to circumvent the issue with semantics.

As Charlie Kirk notes, this denial is on its face ridiculous when considering the timeline of facts:

John Kirby denies that Joe Biden has ""unfrozen"" Iranian funds.Let's go through a timeline of facts:$10 billion - November 2023 - Biden regime reapproved a sanctions waiver that unlocks upwards of $10 billion in frozen funds of Iraqi payments for Iranian energy.$6 billion -…pic.twitter.com/67onl2qN2h

Kirby also had no answer when Doocy asked why Biden had to return to DC from Delaware on Saturday, despite the fact that his handlers are always saying he can “work from anywhere,” as a way of justifying his constant beach vacations.

Doocy: “And, you guys often defend all the trips to Delaware by saying the President is not on vacation. He’s working. He can be the President from anywhere. So, why do you have to come back on Saturday?”WH’s John Kirby: “Oh, we got indications shortly after arriving — we got…pic.twitter.com/w37bYsbzbb

This all comes on the heels of revelations that Biden green lighted Iran’s attack and told Israel to “take the win,” of managing to shoot down the vast majority of missiles fired at them, without retaliating.

November 5th cannot come quickly enough, as Donald Trump pointed out at the weekend:

Ron Wyden (D-OR) called ""one of the most dramatic and terrifying expansions of government surveillance authority in history.""

""I will do everything in my power to stop it from passing in the Senate,"" said Wyden in a Friday post to X.

This bill represents one of the most dramatic and terrifying expansions of government surveillance authority in history. I will do everything in my power to stop it from passing in the Senate.https://t.co/SAtcvDh1PD

In a Sunday night thread on X from Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice,breaks down why this is so 'terrifying.'

""Buried in the Section 702 reauthorization bill (RISAA) passed by the House on Friday is the biggest expansion of domestic surveillance since the Patriot Act. Senator Wyden calls this power “terrifying,” and he’s right,"" the thread begins.

Buried in the Section 702 reauthorization bill (RISAA) passed by the House on Friday is the biggest expansion of domestic surveillance since the Patriot Act. Senator Wyden calls this power “terrifying,” and he’s right. 2/25https://t.co/9GltMyp5ZY

Continued via X(emphasis ours),

I’ll explain how this new power works.Under current law, the government can compel “electronic communications service providers” that have direct access to communications to assist the NSA in conducting Section 702 surveillance.

In practice, that meanscompanies like Verizon and Google must turn over the communications of the targets of Section 702 surveillance.(The targets must be foreigners overseas, although the communications can—and do—include communications with Americans.)

Through a seemingly innocuous change to the definition of “electronic communications surveillance provider,”an amendment offered by House intel committee (HPSCI) leaders and passed by the Housevastly expands the universe of entities that can be compelled to assist the NSA.

If the bill becomes law,any company or individual that provides ANY service whatsoever may be forced to assist in NSA surveillance, as long as they have access to equipment on which communications are transmitted or stored—such as routers, servers, cell towers, etc. That sweeps in an enormous range of U.S. businesses that provide wifi to their customers and therefore have access to equipment on which communications transit. Barber shops, laundromats, fitness centers, hardware stores, dentist’s offices… the list goes on and on.

It also includes commercial landlordsthat rent out the office space where tens of millions of Americans go to work every day—offices of journalists, lawyers, nonprofits, financial advisors, health care providers, and more.

The version HPSCI leaders offered Friday therefore exempts… hotels, library shops, and coffee shops, plus a handful of other establishments. But as the FISA Court amicus promptly pointed out, the vast majority of U.S. businesses remain fair game. 10/25https://t.co/koARSpYoeQ

The amendment even extends to service providers who come into our homes. House cleaners, plumbers, people performing repairs, and IT services providers have access to laptops and routers inside our homes and could be forced to serve as surrogate spies.

None of these people or businesses would be allowed to tell anyone about the assistance they were compelled to provide. They would be undera gag order, and they would face heavy penalties if they failed to comply with it.

That’s not even the worst part.Unlike Google and Verizon,most of these businesses and individuals lack the ability to isolate and turn over a target’s communications.So they would be required to give the NSA access to the equipment itself or to use techniques or devices (presumably provided by the NSA) to copyand turn over entire communications streams and/or repositories of stored communications, which would inevitably include vast quantities ofwholly domestic communications.

The NSA, having wholesale access to domestic communications on an unprecedented scale,would then be on the “honor system”to pull out and retain only the communications of approved foreign targets. (Let that sink in.)

HPSCI leaders deny that the administration has any intent to use this provision so broadly.Supposedly, there is a single type of service provider that the government wants to rope in. But they didn’t want anyone to know what that service provider was so they hid the real goal by writing the amendment as broadly and vaguely as possible.But no worries, Americans! The administration isn’t actually going to USE all the power it just persuaded the House to give it.

I cannot overstate how mindblowingly irresponsible that is.I don’t think *any* administration should be trusted with an Orwellian power like this one. But even if *this* administration doesn’t plan to make full use of it… (Go ahead and fill in the blank.)

There are certain powers a government should not have in a democracy.The ability to force ordinary businesses and individuals to serve as surrogate spies is one of them. Even if the targets are supposed to be foreigners, a power this sweeping WILL be abused.

By the way, when a privacy advocate tried to get@jahimesto engage on this issue, here is the thoughtful and conscientious reply given by the ranking member of HPSCI, a man who clearly cares deeply about civil liberties. 20/25https://t.co/t2eDFcqRE6

The Senate MUST stop this train before it is too late.The Senate is scheduled to vote on the House-passed bill this week. If there’s an opportunity to remove this provision, senators should remove it. If not, they should vote against the bill.

The White House will tell senators they have no choice other than to pass the House bill, because Section 702 expires on April 19, and trying to fix the House bill—or pass different legislation—would take too long. Butthe April 19 deadline exists only on paper.

A notional deadline is no reason to create a surveillance state. The Senate must take the time to get this right. It’s not just our civil liberties that are at stake—it’s our democracy.@SenatorBennet@SenatorBooker@SenSherrodBrown@SenLaphonza@SenatorCantwell… 24/25

2024-04-17 07:20:00,Biden Calls For Tripling Tariffs On Chinese Steel Ahead Of Speech In Swing State Of Pennsylvania,https://web.archive.org/web/20240417131600/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/biden-calls-tripling-tariffs-chinese-steel-ahead-speech-swing-state-pennsylvania,"The White Houseannouncedon Wednesday morning that President Biden will call for tripling tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum in a speech later today to steelworkers in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state.

Biden is set to speak with United Steelworkers union members in Pittsburgh. This is part of a multi-day campaign across the swing state to convince unions and residents about more years offailed'Bidenomics.' While Biden campaigns, New York Judge Juan Merchan warned former President Trump he would be arrested if he skipped the trial in his hush-money case in Manhattan.

""President Biden knows that steel is the backbone of the American economy, and a bedrock of our national security. American steel fueled the country's industrialization and helped build the middle class,"" the White House wrote in a press release.

The Financial Timessaid Biden will ask trade representative Katherine Tai to triple the import tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum from the current 7.5%.

""It is important for us to get ahead of China's new export surge and their continued pressure on prices that make it hard for American steel companies to compete,"" a senior US official told FT, who added that the actions had ""nothing to do with elections.""

Anyone with common sense can see these actions were entirely related to elections in the key battleground state.

Tai is nearing completion of a statutory review of the tariffs that former president Donald Trump levied in his trade war against China.

She is also set on Wednesday to unveil a probe into unfair practices in the Chinese shipbuilding industry, following a petition from United Steelworkers.

White House National Economic Adviser Lael Brainard told reporters, ""China's policy-driven overcapacity poses a serious risk to the future of the American steel and aluminum industry,"" adding, ""Beijing is simply too big to play by its own rules.""

Meanwhile, a senior administration official told NBC News, ""If taken, these actions will not increase inflation ... and it will protect American jobs and the steel industry.""

Basic economics says that higher tariffs can spark inflation and drive a negative supply shock, raising the prices of inputs to production and thus increasing output prices.

Revisiting the Biden's Inflation Reduction Act... Has it brought inflation back to Fed Powell's comfort zone of sub-2 %? The answer is no.Inflation is reaccelerating.

The Pittsburgh announcement is nothing more than a political stunt as Biden attempts to win Pennsylvania and New York courts have tied Trump's hands so that he can't campaign in the swing state for now.

2024-04-17 07:45:00,Peter Schiff: The Data Looks Grim For The Dollar,https://web.archive.org/web/20240417131600/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/peter-schiff-data-looks-grim-dollar#comment-stream,"Peter’s back in Puerto Rico this week for his podcast after another week of record gold prices. In this episode, he discusses media coverage of inflation, this week’s CPI report, and Bitcoin’s weakening price relative to gold.

Peter starts by recapping this week’s price action and movements in the dollar’s strength. The dollar is currently performing better than other foreign currencies, but that doesn’t mean it’s doing well:

“The dollar index was up today, but that doesn’t mean the dollar was up.Gold tells you the dollar was down.What the rising dollar index tells you in an environment of a rising gold price is that the dollar is losing value.It’s just losing less value than the euro— or losing its value more slowly than the euro or the pound or the yen.That’s what’s happening. I mean, if I’m going backwards at 10 miles an hour and there’s a car next to me going backwards at 20 miles an hour, relative to that car, I’m going forwards. But I’m not. I’m actually going backwards. I’m just going backwards more slowly than the other car.”

The financial press is either completely oblivious to the reasons gold is surging or they’re choosing to provide political cover to policymakers responsible for inflating the dollar:

“Like I said with the canary and the coal mine,instead of recognizing, ‘Gee, gold’s going up because of inflation,’ they’re making up other reasons for why gold’s going up.Like the Canary died of a heart attack. ‘Gold’s going up because of geopolitical risk.’They don’t want to admit that gold’s going up because of inflation, because the Fed is making a mistake,because these rate cuts are wrong, because they should be hiking rates. So they [the press] do this whole segment on inflation, and they don’t even mention gold.”

With persistent evidence of inflation, the media is at least starting to question the narrative that we need more interest rate cuts:

“They’re now starting to say, ‘Hmm, maybe we’re not going to get any cuts.’ They’re not saying that we’re going to get hikes. … They are starting to question the validity of the cuts, but nobody is questioning the reality of the fact that they should never have stopped hiking— that that’s what the rising gold price is signaling, that interest rates are too low and that they need to go up. Not just in the US, they need to go up everywhere. …Everybody has to raise rates sharply. I’m not talking about ‘mamby-pamby’ quarter point rate hikes. We need 200 basis point hikes.”

Gold’s and silver’s bullish streaks bode well for the metals, but not for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies:

“The price of Bitcoin is down to about 18.6 ounces of gold. The high was 27 two and a half years ago. So we’re getting deeper into bear market territory.None of these Bitcoiners want to acknowledge this. Despite all the hype, ETFs, all this big rally, Bitcoin never made a new high in real money. And it may not.”

Wednesday’s CPI came in hot again, with a 0.4 percent increase from last month. Year-over-year inflation is now at 3.5%, which is not close to the Fed’s 2% target:

“If you were objective and just looking at the CPI, you would say, ‘Oh, we better hike rates. Inflation is going up, not down.’ But they’re still saying, ‘No, no, no, we’re expecting to cut rates.’ Why?Based on what would you expect to cut rates? Certainly not based on the data. The data doesn’t support a rate cut.”

Between increasing institutional demand for gold and strong evidence of future inflation, the fate of the dollar does not look good:

“Imagine how much stronger [gold’s] going to be when the dollar is going down, and it will go down.And if anything, the rising gold price is what will cause the dollar to go down, because at some point when gold gets high enough, there will be a stampede into gold by foreign central banks, by the public, by hedge funds, pension funds, and endowments. And where are they going to get the money to buy all that gold? They’re going to use dollars. So the dollar is going to get killed. It has no chance against gold.”

The next few months will be critical for the American and global economies. If the Fed continues its inflationary policy, it will spell disaster and worsen the coming crisis.

2024-04-17 08:11:18,Futures Rebound After 3 Day Rout As Rates Drop From 2024 Highs,https://web.archive.org/web/20240417131600/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/futures-rebound-after-3-day-rout-rates-drop-2024-highs#comment-stream,"US equity futures and European markets are higher, reversing several days of losses after positive earnings from some of Europe’s biggest companies lifted the mood as markets were roiled by a more hawkish outlook for interest rates. Futures on the S&P 500 rose by 0.4% reversing three days of losses that saw the S&P drop by 2.9% to close Tuesday near a two-month low. Nasdaq 100 contracts edged higher, while consumer products and services led an advance of 0.7% in the Stoxx Europe 600.Treasury yields retreated from a 2024 peak  helping small-caps outperform pre-market, and a gauge of the dollar snapped five days of gains that took it to a five-month high after Powell said it would likely take longer to have confidence that inflation is headed toward the central bank’s target. Commodities are mixed with metals stronger and oil weaker even as tensions in the Middle East persisted, while Israel weighs a response to Iran’s weekend attack. Macro data is light today with Beige Book, TIC (keep an eye on CB sales), and mortgage apps (which rose 3.3% after rising 0.1% last week).

In premarket trading, all seven Mag7 names are higher; semis are seeing some weakness following ASML’s earnings release (misses on orders/revs and beat on EPS; stock -4%). United Airlines shares rose 5.4% after the carrier’s second-quarter adjusted earnings per share forecast beat consensus estimates. Additionally, the company reported first-quarter operating revenue that came ahead of expectations. Here are some other notable movers:

Stocks have come under pressure this week as traders recalibrated bets on the timing and extent of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Corporate earnings will now have to do the heavy lifting for any rally, according to strategist at Barclays Plc and Bank Julius Baer who recommend buying the dips in anticipation of an economic recovery that could boost profits.

“We would actually advise to use such an opportunity to gradually increase exposure to cyclicals in the anticipation of the new economic cycle starting to unfold in second half of this year,”said Leonardo Pellandini, equity strategist at Bank Julius Baer. He likes shares of companies tied to the business cycle, those poised to gain from growth and inflation.

With earnings season about to go into high gear as tech giants report next week, market-implied expectations for Fed rate cuts have collapsed as tensions in the Mideast fan inflation expectations and a resilient US economy defies calls for easier policy. After starting the year by pricing in as many as six rate cuts,traders are now betting on two or less. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday it would likely take longer to have confidence that inflation is headed toward the central bank’s target.

Meanwhile, tensions in the Middle East continue to simmer. Israel is weighing a response to what was the first attack on the Jewish state from Iranian soil. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates called for maximum “self-restraint” to spare the region “from the dangers of war and its dire consequences,” in an unusually frank joint statement Wednesday.

European stocks rose: the Stoxx 600 is up 0.5%, led by consumer product shares after reassuring updates from LVMH and Adidas. Technology stocks underperform as ASML falls 4% after new orders fell short of expectations. Among individual movers, Sportswear maker Adidas AG climbed more than 6% after raising its revenue and profit outlook, while LVMH led luxury stocks higher on the back of reassuring results. Rio Tinto Plc rose after saying elevated steel exports by China will continue support demand for the raw material. Volvo AB gained after the Swedish truckmaker reported resilient margins. ASML Holding NV plunged more than 6% after missing estimates for first-quarter orders. Just Eat Takeaway.com NV shares slumped after the company said orders slipped in the first quarter, signaling continued weak demand for food deliveries.

Earlier in the session, Asia’s lagging stock benchmark briefly erased its gain for the year, as worries about higher-for-longer interest rates and geopolitical tensions triggered losses across the region. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell as much as 0.4% Wednesday before paring losses, with consumer discretionary and industrials among the biggest drags.The measure was hovering around 169.39, the closing level reached on the last trading day of 2023,after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled policymakers will wait longer than previously anticipated to cut interest rates.

Hong Kong stocks were little changed while mainland China gauges sharply rebounded from Tuesday’s losses that were driven by mixed economic data. Chinese small-caps rose, paring this week’s selloff, as the nation’s top securities regulator sought to ease concern over the potential delisting of firms with weak financial health. Overseas investors have sold more than $2.2 billion worth of equities on a net basis in emerging Asia excluding China in April, according to latest data compiled by Bloomberg. The bulk of the selling happened this week. Other bleak milestones are flashing across the region as the 10-day historical volatility on the MSCI index spikes. The Australian stock benchmark briefly erased its 2024 gains on Tuesday while South Korea’s small-cap gauge remains on the verge of entering a technical correction.

In FX, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell for the first time in six sessions while European stocks gain after positive earnings from some of the region’s biggest companies. The pound rises 0.4% after UK consumer prices slowed less than expected in March. Only the kiwi is having a better day among the G-10’s, rising 0.5% versus the greenback after data showed home-grown price pressures remained persistent.

In rates, treasury yields are lower by up to 3bp across belly of the curve with 5s30s spread steeper by 2.5bp on the day;10-year yields trade around 4.645% down by 3bps from the 2024 highs hit yesterday...

...outperforming bunds and gilts by ~2bp, with front-end and belly leading, re-steepening 5s30s spread back toward middle of Tuesday’s range. Core European rates lag, led by front-end gilts after March UK inflation data showed less slowing than expected. US session includes 20-year bond auction but no major economic releases or Fed speakers. Treasury coupon sales resume at 1pm New York time with $13b 20-year bond reopening; a $23b 5-year TIPS new issue sale is ahead Thursday. WI 20-year yield ~4.875% is roughly 33bp cheaper than last month’s, which got a strong reception and stopped 2bp through.

In commodities, European natural gas edged higher for a fifth day. Oil dipped, with Brent crude falling below $90 a barrel and WTI falling 0.7% to trade near $84.70 a barrel as traders wait to see how Israel would respond to Iran’s weekend attack. Spot gold rose 0.4% to around $2,393/oz.

In crypto, Bitcoin is modestly firmer and back above USD 63.5k, Ethereum narrowly holds above USD 3k.

Looking to the day ahead now, and there are plenty of central bank speakers, including ECB President Lagarde, the ECB’s Cipollone, de Cos and Schnabel, BoE Governor Bailey, and the BoE’s Greene and Haskel, along with the Fed’s Mester and Bowman. In addition, the Fed will be releasing their Beige Book. Otherwise, data releases include the UK CPI print for March. Finally in the political sphere, EU leaders will be meeting in Brussels.

APAC stocks traded mixed as the region picked up the pieces from the prior day's heavy selling but with the recovery limited after the choppy performance stateside amid Fed commentary and geopolitical concerns.ASX 200 eked mild gains albeit with upside capped by a lacklustre mining sector after Rio Tinto's quarterly production update which showed a decline in iron output and shipments from a year ago. Nikkei 225 was choppy after somewhat mixed trade data and recent speculation of FX intervention. Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp. were varied with the mainland underpinned by supportive measures with China's Financial Regulator vowing to allocate more credit resources to support manufacturing industry development and will continuously increase the proportion of medium to long-term loans for the sector, while financial institutions in Shanghai are to provide CNY 2tln in funding to support innovative technology companies over the next three years under an initiative backed by the PBoC.

European bourses, Stoxx600 (+0.4%) are mostly firmer, with the exception of the AEX (-0.2%), hampered by poor ASML (-3.5%) results. Luxury name LVMH (+2.5%) leads the CAC 40 (+1%) higher.Sectors hold a positive tilt; Basic Resources tops the pile, benefiting from broader strength in underlying metals prices, namely iron. Consumer Products is lifted by Luxury bellwether LVMH, as well as post-earnings strength in Adidas (+8.1%). Tech is found at the foot of the pile after the poor ASML metrics. US Equity Futures (ES +0.3%, NQ +0.3%, RTY +0.3%) are modestly firmer and are trading towards session highs. UAL (+4.9%) benefits post-earnings, after reporting solid metrics and noting that demand remained strong.

Geopolitics: Middle East

DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap

Markets have stabilised a bit this morning after losing further ground yesterday, as investors continued to be increasingly sceptical about the chance of rate cuts, especially in the US. That was driven by some hawkish remarks from central bank officials, but risk appetite was also dampened by ongoing fears about a military escalation in the Middle East. That meant it was a pretty tough backdrop for most assets, and the selloff saw yields on 10yr Treasuries (+6.5bps) reach a fresh 5-month high of 4.67%. The S&P 500 (-0.21%) lost ground for a third day running even if futures are up by around the same amount this morning. Meanwhile in Europe, the losses were even bigger, and the STOXX 600 (-1.53%) had its worst performance in 9 months.

Yesterday's losses gathered pace as the day went on, but a key catalyst were remarks from Fed Vice Chair Jefferson. He said that “ if incoming data suggest that inflation is more persistent than I currently expect it to be, it will be appropriate to hold in place the current restrictive stance of policy for longer. I am fully committed to getting inflation back to 2 percent.” So an explicit acknowledgement that further upside inflation surprises would lead to a longer period of restrictive policy. Later in the day, Fed Chair Powell echoed the risks of a greater delay to rate cuts, saying that the “The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that is likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence” in the path of inflation and noting that the Fed can keep rates steady “as long as needed”.

Those remarks saw investors price increased chances of higher-for-longer rates, with Fed funds futures now pricing only 40bps of cuts by year-end, the lowest this has been so far in this cycle. 2yr Treasury yields briefly passed 5% intra-day around the time of Powell’s comments, before closing +6.6bps higher on the day at 4.99%. And 10yr yields hit their highest level since early November (+6.5bps to 4.67%). Real rates drove the increase, with 10yr real yields up +8.0bps to 2.25%, but there were also rising market concerns about inflation. For instance, the US 2yr inflation swap (+2.2bps) reached a fresh one-year high of 2.68%, its highest level since the SVB turmoil back in March 2023.

Over in Europe, yesterday also brought some new comments from ECB President Lagarde. She confirmed that the ECB were moving closer towards a rate cut, saying that “If we don’t have a major shock in developments, we are heading towards a moment where we have to moderate the restrictive monetary policy that we have”. But even so, it was clear that the potential for a more hawkish Fed was having an impact on their thoughts, and Lagarde said that the ECB needed to pay attention to changes in exchange rates. Moreover, investors slightly dialled back the chance of a June cut, which fell from 90% the previous day to 87% by the close. Sovereign bonds sold off across the continent, with yields on 10yr bunds (+4.7bps), OATs (+5.3bps) and BTPs (+6.5bps) all experiencing fresh losses. For 10yr bunds, that left them at 2.48%, their highest level since November as well. On Monday DB changed their ECB rate profile from five cuts this year to three, even if the terminal rate remains at 2%, albeit pushed back three quarters to Q1 2026. See the note with the rationale here.

For Europe, a recent complication has been the path of natural gas prices, and yesterday saw futures rise another +6.53% to €33.45/MWh, well off the recent lows of €25.80/MWh on April 3. That’s been driven by growing geopolitical risk, and the move has left prices at their highest levels since early January. In the meantime, oil prices saw some stabilisation, with Brent Crude down a marginal -0.09% to $90.02 yesterday, and trading slightly lower at $89.50/bbl as I type.

For equities, there was growing concern about the prospect of rates staying higher, leading to a fresh selloff on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe the selloff was particularly sharp, driven by growing concern about energy prices, as well as a catchup to the late US selloff the previous day. Indeed, both the STOXX 600 (-1.53%) and the FTSE 100 (-1.82%) experienced their worst daily performance since July, back when yields were breaching post-GFC highs. In the US, there was a much better performance, and the S&P 500 only fell -0.21%, which was pretty stable after its heavy declines in the previous two sessions. But this was still a rather broad decline, with the equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 down -0.54%. Banks (-1.82%) underperformed within the S&P 500, with Bank of America falling -3.53% after reporting higher charge-offs (despite a slight earnings beat). The NASDAQ (-0.12%) and the Magnificent 7 (-0.32%) saw modest declines.

The negative sentiment also saw US high yield spreads (+6.0bps) widen for the fourth session in a row, the longest such run since January. By contrast, safe haven assets again benefitted, with gold up +1.71% to yet another record high of $2,398/oz while the broad dollar index (+0.05%) eked out another 5-month high.

Markets are stabilising in Asia with small catch-up declines but no additional falls. In fact Chinese stocks are rising on positive regulatory news. The small cap CSI 2000 is up +5.49% after the stock market regulator suggested only around 100 small caps would be delisted on tighter rules that would eliminate those in poor financial health. The number had been expected to be far higher but the regulator has said it will be confined to pure zombie companies. The Shanghai Composite (+1.24%) and the CSI (+0.79%) are rising in sympathy.

Elsewhere the KOSPI (-0.30%), Nikkei (-0.17%) and the Hang Seng (-0.13%) are lower but there is more calm than earlier in the week. The S&P/ASX 200 (+0.19%) is higher.

Early morning data showed that Japan’s exports grew +7.3% y/y in March (v/s +7.0% expected), up from +7.8% increase in the previous month as the slump in the yen provided a tailwind alongside demand in China picking up. Imports fell -4.9% y/y in March, compared with Bloomberg's estimate of a -5.1% decline as against a +0.5% gain in February. The total merchandise trade surplus stood in line with analysts' projections in March, coming in at ¥366.5 billion (v/s ¥345.5 billion) as against a revised -¥377.8 billion deficit recorded in February.

Here in the UK, the focus will now be on this morning’s CPI release for March, which is coming out shortly after we go to press. But yesterday we also heard from BoE Governor Bailey, who struck a relatively sanguine tone, noting “strong evidence” of price pressures easing in the UK. Bailey’s remarks came after the European close, where yields on 10yr gilts (+5.8bps) had already hit a 5-month high in the session. At the same time, investors continued to discount the chance of BoE rate cuts this year, with just 43bps now priced by the December meeting, down -9.3bps from the previous day. This came after yesterday’s stronger-than-expected February wage data, which saw regular average weekly earnings growing at +6.0% on a 3-month year-on-year basis (vs. +5.8% expected).

Whilst bonds were selling off globally, the one exception to that pattern came in Canada, where the latest inflation data surprised on the downside. It showed median core CPI fall to +2.8% (vs. +3.0% expected), trim core CPI fall to +3.1% (vs. +3.2% expected), whilst headline was in line with expectations at +2.9%. In turn, investors ratcheted up the chance of a rate cut at the Bank of Canada’s next meeting to 71%, up from 60% the previous day. And yields on 10yr government bonds were down -1.0bps, in contrast to the moves elsewhere.

In terms of yesterday’s other data, US industrial production was in line with expectations, showing +0.4% growth in March. But that came alongside an upward revision of three-tenths to the previous month’s growth. However, housing starts fell to an annualised rate of 1.321m in March (vs. 1.485m expected), the lowest in seven months. Similarly, building permits were down to an annualised rate of 1.458m (vs. 1.510m expected), the lowest in eight months. With all those releases, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model for Q1 is pointing to an annualised growth rate of 2.9%, up a tenth relative to the previous day.

Finally, the IMF released their latest World Economic Outlook yesterday, including growth forecasts for the global economy. They upgraded their global growth forecast for 2024 by a tenth relative to January, and now see growth of +3.2% this year. In particular, there were upgrades for the United States, which moved up six-tenths to +2.7%, although the Euro Area was downgraded a tenth to +0.8%. For 2025, they left their global growth forecast unchanged at +3.2%.

To the day ahead now, and there are plenty of central bank speakers, including ECB President Lagarde, the ECB’s Cipollone, de Cos and Schnabel, BoE Governor Bailey, and the BoE’s Greene and Haskel, along with the Fed’s Mester and Bowman. In addition, the Fed will be releasing their Beige Book. Otherwise, data releases include the UK CPI print for March. Finally in the political sphere, EU leaders will be meeting in Brussels.

2024-04-17 08:25:00,"""No Clear Trend What Happens Next"": Stocks Are Displaying Bearish Features Last Seen In 2022",https://web.archive.org/web/20240417131600/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/no-clear-trend-what-happens-next-stocks-are-displaying-bearish-features-last-seen-2022,"By Tatiana Darie, Bloomberg markets live reporter and strategist

The stocks selloff is displaying features that were often seen back when shares plunged in 2022, which is a warning for equities now.

The S&P 500 has fallen for seven of the past 11 trading sessions through Monday, leaving its hit ratio — the amount of daily gains as percentage of total trading days — at 36.4%, on pace for its weakest since December 2022.

During the months when this ratio was similarly weak — say below 40% — over the past two years, stocks have seen average losses of 6.2%. Granted, most of it happened in 2022, when the Fed had just started hiking rates and recession fears dominated, so it may not be the most fair parallel. But it adds to other bearish signals, noted by Bloomberg’s Esha Dey here,indicating that the bullish momentum in stocks has turned.

The evidence is a bit mixed on what happens after April ends. Four of the past seven times since 2022 that the S&P 500’s hit ratio was equally low or lower saw stocks gain or hold unchanged in the following month as dip-buyers emerged. Yet in the remaining three times, stocks saw more heavy losses.

A lot will depend on corporate America’s showing this earnings season and where Treasury yields go from here. Tech giants like Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon — among those projected to lead profit growth in the S&P 500 — are due to report next week and may offer a helping hand to stocks.

More immediately, though, the two-year yield is flirting with 5%, a level that’s proven scary for equities in the past(see ""Morgan Stanley: 10-Year Yields Have ""Decisively"" Broken Through The Risk Level For Stocks"").

2024-04-17 08:45:00,"""You're Not Going To Be Speaker Much Longer"" - Massie Joins MTG In Calling For Johnson's Ouster",https://web.archive.org/web/20240417131600/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/youre-not-going-be-speaker-much-longer-massie-joins-mtg-calling-johnsons-ouster,"Kentucky CongressmanThomas Massie on Tuesday became the second representative to call for an end to Mike Johnson's reign as Speaker of the House, joining Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene.

He delivered that news directly to Johnson in a closed-door Republican conference meeting, telling the Louisianan""you’re not going to be the speaker much longer,”two representatives toldPolitico. Massie has criticized Johnson for backing aid packages for Ukraine and Israel, kick-the-can spending bills and the extension ofwarrantless NSA spyingvia the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act -- while failing to bolster border security.

🚨 Congress gives itself a carve out in the reauthorization of FISA 702 warrantless spying on Americans.The bill requires the FBI to notify and seek consent from Congress before violating the privacy of Congressmen.This will persuade many members of Congress to vote yes.pic.twitter.com/usKVeNnq3b

In March, Greene -- incensed at Johnson for collaborating with Democrats to push through a $1.2 trillion spending package over the objection of conservatives seeking spending cuts --filed a motion to ""vacate the chair,""which would initiate a vote by House members on whether to fire Johnson from the job of speaker.

It's unclear when Greene, Massie or someone else will call for a vote on the motion.Greene has said that she wants to allow time ""for us to go through the process, take our time and find a new speakerof the House that will stand with Republicans and our Republican majority instead of standing with the Democrats.” She's also expressed wariness overrisking the GOP's razor-thin House majority-- which has withered in recent weeks as multipleRepublicans announced they're leaving Congress before finishing their terms.

This is how the Constitution dies.By a tie vote, the amendment to require a warrant to spy on Americans goes down in flames.This is a sad day for America.The Speaker doesn’t always vote in the House, but he was the tie breaker today. He voted against warrants.pic.twitter.com/i49GnCzyPm

Massie says it's only a matter of time before the House votes on Greene's motion to vacate.“The motion is going to get called, OK?Does anybody doubt that? The motion will get called,"" Massietoldreporters after Tuesday's meeting.  ""And then he's gonna lose more votes than Kevin McCarthy.And I have told him this in private, like weeks ago.” Johnson's predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, was himself dethroned in October via a motion to vacate the chair.

While Massie and Greene are far from alone in their disappointment in Johnson, many of their disgruntled colleagues arewary of a scenario in which Johnson is ousted and the House spends days or weeks  struggling to settle on a successor.

Friday, we have one less Republican in the majority as Rep Gallagher leaves instead of finishing his term.As a going away gift, Speaker Johnson plans to force the senate to take up Gallagher’s bill to ban tiktok and give Presidential power to ban websites.But still no border.

""We saw what happened last fall when this all went down — there’s not an alternative…You are not going to get a majority of votes for any new person,” Louisiana Rep. Garret Graves toldPolitico.

Massie has asked Johnson to first allow the party to select a successor, and then voluntarily step down. On Tuesday, Johnson was defiant. “I am not resigningand it is in my view an absurd notion that someone would bring a vacate motion when we are simply trying to do our job,” he told reporters.

Massie's announcement in the closed-door meeting ruffled feathers.Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan voiced his discomfort with the idea,saying, ""We don't need that, no way. We don't want that. We shouldn't go through that again. That's a bad idea.”

“I regard myself as a wartime Speaker.”Get a grip; we are not at war. You can’t use that as an excuse to justify passage of warrantless spying, a bloated omnibus, or $100 billion in foreign aid.https://t.co/hOb0IRNxVr

OnMonday night,Johnson compounded conservatives' anger when he announced he would bring four separate measures to a vote: aid to Ukraine, aid to Israel, aid to Taiwan and another bill with miscellaneous measures including a TikTok ban. As theNew York Timesexplains, the goal is to cobble together legislation that would match what Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is cooking up:

If all four pieces passed the House, they would then be folded into a single bill for the Senate to take up, in an effort to ensure that senators could not cherry-pick pieces to approve or reject.

“We’re steering toward everything Chuck Schumer wants,”said Massie. Decoupling the proposals also saps conservatives' leverage to force more spending on border security. Greene called the plan ""a scam"" and added,""He’s definitely not going to be speaker next Congressif we’re lucky enough to have the majority.""

2024-04-17 09:44:00,Rugpull Imminent As Wall Street Most Bullish And Euphoric Since Last Market Peak: FMS Survey,https://web.archive.org/web/20240417131600/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/rugpull-imminent-wall-street-most-bullish-and-euprhoic-last-market-peak-fms-survey,"For the past three years, we have consistently said that the BofA Fund Manager Survey (FMS) is the most incongruous combination of zero signal and ample, schizophrenic noise, a ""survey"" in which the respondentsanswer not what they are actually doing, but what they would like to be doing orperceivedas doing, and failing that, what they think is the right answereven if two consecutive replies may be diametrically opposing and make zero sense taken together (alternatively, it feels like every FMS respondent is a pathological liar and nobody actually tells the truth about what they are doing either out of paranoia or, well,because they are pathological liar).

Which is also why we have urged readers toat mostspend just a few minutes each month on the cacophonous orgy of noise that is the BofA Fund Manager Survey, which not only has zero signal but has zero correlation to the market. It does, however, correlate to itself and any time sentiment turns overly euphoric or apocalyptic,that's the hint to take the other side in the market.A good example of this was  August 2022, when FMS organizer Michael Hartnett said that Wall Street's ""Mood Was No Longer Apocalyptic"", and therefore he recommendedshorting the S&P just as the S&P hit the highest level for several quarters(he was spot on, as that proved to be the high point for US stocks when proceeded to tumble into a bear market and remained depressed until almost a year later, or May 2023, when the AI bubble took over and sent stocks to fresh 52-week highs).

Fast forward almost a year ahead, when last October - just as stocks hit a multi-month low - Hartnett, who had previously been very bearish, turned bullish because as the BofA CIO warned looking at that month's Fund Manager Survey,""investors have turned bearish again.""To which we said that ""those who always correctly fade the FMS (and shorted the market one month ago when the mood turned ridiculously bullish),may be just the right time to go long, and Hartnett confirms as much,commenting that the ""BofA Bull & Bear Indicator at 2.2 =close to buy signal""and a FMS Cash Rule (>5%) = buy signal.""

2024-04-17 14:23:41,California Assembly Rejects Legislation To Make Child Prostitution A Felony,https://web.archive.org/web/20240418105458/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-17/california-assembly-rejects-legislation-make-child-prostitution-felony,"The pervasive progressive agenda that has become the ideological compass driving policymaking in California has turned what was once romanticized as the Golden State into something more synonymous with a degenerate cesspool. While proponents of that progressive agenda would be quick to chastise anyone making that criticism as some sort of alt-right extremist by branding them as a transphobe, xenophobe, or whatever empty insult best fits the context of the argument, the most recent action from the California Assembly makes it difficult to argue with any repudiation of what the state deems political correct. The latest instance of this slow but steady moral decline was evidenced by the California Assembly Public Safety Committee rejecting provisions in a bill that would have made solicitation of prostitution of a minor a felony.

Today, the Senate Public Safety Committee refused to pass my bill to send child sex buyers to prison.Instead of making the buying of kids a felony with prison time, the committee forced me to take amendments I didn’t agree with and watered down my bill to allow a fine or…

Republican State Senator Shannon Grove authoredSenate Bill 1414in an effort to amend sections 290 and 647 of the California Penal Code to facilitate escalating the crime of soliciting prostitution of a minor from a mere misdemeanor to a felony. Presently, the misdemeanor charge carries a penalty of a minimum of 2 days in county jail with any further sentenced not to exceed 1 year and/or a fine of $10,000.Under Grove's proposal, the offense would be punishable by imprisonment in state prison for 2 to 4 yearsanda fine of up to $25,000.Grove was joined by democratic State Senators Anna Caballero and Susan Rubio in authoring the bill.

Grove spoke to the impetus behind the bill, saying:

“SB 1414 states that any individual who solicits, agrees to engage in, or engages in any act of commercial sex with a minor will face felony charges. If passed, this law will hold these offenders accountable under strict liability (meaning buyers can’t just claim they thought the child was of age) and they will face imprisonment in the state prison, along with fines up to $25,000 and mandatory registration as a sex offender. We must continue to shed light on the darkness of human trafficking, bring justice and protection to those who are most vulnerable. We are sending a clear message with SB 1414– Not one more child should have to suffer at the hands of those who seek to exploit and harm them.”

Despite the obvious moral imperative to advance the bill, SB 1414 was only able to pass the California Assembly Public Safety Committee after the addition of an amendment which all but nullified its raison d'etre.Members of the committee made changes to the proposed bill which nullified the increased felony charges to anyone arrested for solicitation of prostitution of a minor in the event the child purchased for sex is 16 years old or older.The amendment was to Grove's dismay as she said “That’s garbage — garbage. I don’t know what to say,” Grove said after the bill passed with the amendments, she rejected. “I may pull my name off the bill. It’s not my bill. They hijacked my bill, and they turned it into something that was palatable to them.” following the revised bill's passage by the committee after hearing.

THIS IS INSANE!⚠️🚨Yesterday, California’s Senate Democrats Rejected Bill to Make Purchasing 16, 17-year-olds for Sex a Felony.Democrats rejected Bill authored by Sen. Shannon Grove to make the buying of children for sex a prison felony, and hijacked her bill forcing hostile…pic.twitter.com/1bMFP8ng8D

SB 1414 isn't the first time Grove has exposed the California Assembly Public Safety Committee for its lax policy making when it comes to protect minors from sex crimes. Last year, Grove authored SB 14 which sought to make child sex trafficking a felony once again in the state. The law designated human trafficking of a minor for purposes of a commercial sex act as a felony that would qualify under the state's “Three Strikes” law.Despite passing the Senate unanimously, the same committee blocked its passage.Outrage following the committee shooting down SB 14 prompted a re-vote on the bill which ultimately passed it leading to Governor Gavin Newsom finally signing it into law in September 2023.

While California's politicians approach bills like Grove's aimed at protecting children from being victims of sex crimes with resistance,they shamelessly embrace others that put children in danger.This is best exemplified by Senate Bill 145 which passed in 2020. The bill amended existing state laws to allow judges to decide whether an adult convicted of having sex with a minor should register as a sex offender in cases in which the minor is 14 years or older and the adult is not more than 10 years older than the minor.

SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES@Scott_Wieneris at it again. The guy who brought us the law where a 24yr old can have sex with a 14 yr old is now a misdemeanor & no need to register as a sex offender. He has a proposed bill AB957 for a minor “transitioning” in a custody battle…https://t.co/0pdMunmPropic.twitter.com/gK1Sw5LgXa

That bill was authored by State SenatorScott Wienerunder the guise that existing laws somehow discriminated against California's LGBTQ population. Before the bill was signed into law by Newsom adults who were convicted of having sex with a minor were automatically added to the state’s sex offender registry.Wiener's legislation eliminated automatic sex offender registration in those cases,instead giving deference to judges on whether or not to require convicts register as sex offenders.

The juxtaposition of Californian politicians' leniency toward child sex criminals compared to their concerted effort to undermine bills brought by the likes of Grove to protect children highlights the utter abandonment of any moral compass driving the state's policy making. With this wanton disregard for fighting sex crimes against children, it's no wonder that California remains one of the states with the most cases of child trafficking in the country.

2024-04-17 15:31:40,The US government shattered its own quarterly debt record,https://web.archive.org/web/20240418105458/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-17/us-government-shattered-its-own-quarterly-debt-record,"by James Hickman via Schiff Sovereign

It’s barely six months into the US government’s ‘fiscal year’ (which started on October 1, 2023) and the federal budget deficit is already $1.1 trillion.

This number is utterly astonishing.

Of course, anyone paying attention to the rapidly dwindling US financial condition knows that the national debt is now hovering around $35 trillion.

That’s up $2 trillion in the last year alone, and up nearly $20 trillion over the last decade.

More importantly, the Congressional Budget Office has projected that the US national debt will increase by another $20 trillion over the next decade.

Those numbers are obviously bad. Horrendous, really.

But what’s even worse is how much NEW debt the government actually needs to sell each year just to repay its OLD debt.

Remember, whenever the government borrows money, they issue bonds in various denominations; these bonds can be as short as 28 days, all the way up to 30 years.

Whenever these bonds mature, the Treasury Department is obviously supposed to pay them back in full. Of course the federal government doesn’t actually have money to repay its debts. So, instead they issue new debt to pay back the old debt.

And the amount of money they have to raise just to repay old debts is staggering.

Last year alone the Treasury Department had to raise nearly$20 trillionto repay maturing bonds. Plus, they borrowed an additional$2.4trillion in brand new debt on top of the $20 trillion.

And so far in just thefirst three monthsof 2024, the Treasury Department has issued a record$7.2 trillionin government bonds– shattering the previous record for quarterly debt issuance that was set in 2020 during the pandemic.

Out of last quarter’s $7.2 trillion debt issuance, roughly $600 billion of that was brand new debt… meaning that a whopping $6.6 trillion was borrowed to refinance existing debt.

To put that number in context, the total combined value of all bank deposits in the United States is $17.5 trillion. So merely refinancing the federal debt that maturedlast quarter alonerequired the equivalent of 37% of all US bank deposits.

Now, in theory, refinancing US government bonds shouldn’t be such a big deal. After all, most bondholders typically just roll over their maturing bonds into new bonds. And the majority of the maturing bonds are short-term anyhow.

So, it’s quite common that some money market fund– which owns primarily 90-day Treasury Bills– will simply purchase more 90-day Treasury Bills whenever their existing ones mature.

Well, the problem is that bond investors are rightfully getting spooked by outrageous federal deficits, and they’re starting to demand a higher rate of return to compensate for the extra risk.

This is a major reason why interest rates have been rising– government bonds have lost a lot of appeal, and many investors no longer view them as the sacrosanct, risk-free investments they once were.

Two years ago, a 90-day T-bill paid about 0.5%. Today it’s over 5%.That’s a 10X increase in the government’s interest expense.

Another major trend is that bond investors have shifted towards the shorter duration maturities. So, instead of buying 10-year notes and 30-year bonds, they’re buying 90-day bills that have to be refinanced every three months.

This makes sense; with so much risk and uncertainty, few rational investors want to loan money to the federal government for three decades. Short-term bonds are a lot safer.

But this trend towards short-term bonds means that the Treasury Department has to constantly be in the market refinancing record amounts of debt, just like last quarter’s $6.6 trillion.

It also means that the government’s annual interest bill will continue to skyrocket– because today’s interest rates are so much higher than they were in the past.

Back in 2019, for example, investors were buying 5-year notes with a yield of less than 2%.

Those 5-year notes from 2019 are about to mature. And for investors who are willing to roll over their funds and reinvest in, say, 90-day T-bills, the new yield is 5.25%.

In other words, the government’s interest expense will increase more than 2.5x.

Remember that this year’s interest expense on the national debt is already set to exceed the national defense budget. And if this trend continues,the government’s annual interest bill will surpass $2 trillion over the next few years.

This is why we believe the Federal Reserve will ultimately step in and ‘fix’ this problem by expanding the money supply and slashing interest rates.

The US government cannot afford to pay 5% interest on the national debt. Frankly they can’t even afford to pay 1%. The Fed understands this reality, and they know that the clock is ticking.

That’s why the Fed has been so vocal about cutting interest rates over the past few months, even though inflation has been rising.

Minutes from the Fed’s meeting last month showed that theystillanticipate cutting rates 2-3 times this year.

And just yesterday the Fed Chairman said that while rates may stay at current levels “longer than expected”, he all but ruled out any further interest rate increases despite rising inflation numbers.

As a final piece of evidence to support our view, the Fed has already reduced its ‘quantitative tightening’ program… which is essentially the first step towards a new round of quantitative easing, i.e. money printing.

As my partner Peter Schiff says, the Fed has lost the inflation war. But I would say they’re actually deserting the battlefield by abandoning their responsibility to keep inflation low.

The Fed believes that the insolvency of the US government is a far worse outcome than inflation, i.e. inflation is the ‘lesser of the two evils’.

And it seems clear that they’re already positioning their monetary policy to bail out the federal government.

Bottom line: this means more inflation. But don’t panic. It’s something you can prepare for, and even benefit from. More on that soon.

Many can't voice their concerns about the woke mind virus infecting the school's administration because contracts signed during the Covid era silence them from speaking out.

The St. Paul's School in the Greenspring area, just above imploding Baltimore City, and nestled in steeplechase horse country, continues to have a weird fetish about asking young, vulnerable students about their ""gender"" and ""sexuality.""

In January, parents went bonkers when an ""identity inventory"" was handed out to young boys. The questionnaire asked them if they were ""Cisgender"" or ""Transgender"" or ""Gender Non-Conforming"" or ""Agender.""

After the school hushed up several parents, making an example out of at least one, where the parent's kids were suspended then reinstated after the parent spoke out on social media about wokenism being injected into the curriculum, the school could not help itself by going down the woke rabbit hole - once again.

Yet more parents have contacted us about another survey given to young girls at the school. This time, it's called the ""Independent School Health Check,"" and it was administered by the Indiana University Center For Survey Research.

Parents are particularly livid with thesetwo questions (and the answers):

One parent told us this is a ""grooming mechanism ...""

One very concerned parent asked why their kids are data mined by the school like Google does for internet search browsers.

Another parent voiced concerns that other private schools in the area have ""gone full woke,"" while public schools in the state are imploding.

The lesson learned is parents need to heavily vet schools and or get involved to ensure their children are not being brainwashed by dangerous wokeism.

As for the concerned parents, now is the best time to homeschool - or how about - starting a non-woke school that actually focuses on learning instead of toxic gender nonsense.

2024-04-17 21:40:00,Bidenomics - Inflation Persists And Jobs Decay: Gingrich,https://web.archive.org/web/20240418105458/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/bidenomics-inflation-persists-and-jobs-decay-gingrich,"Authored by Newt Gingrich via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Last week brought bad news for the American people and President Joe Biden. Inflation persists and jobs are decaying.

On inflation, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported prices rose 3.5 percent between March 2023 and March 2024. This bad number is far higher than the U.S. Federal Reserve’s goal of 2 percent inflation—and it follows three years of price increases.

Inflation continues to build even after the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates to their highest point in 23 years.

Much to the Fed’s dismay, its restrictive private sector policies are being more than offset by the Biden administration’s massive deficits. While the Fed is trying to take liquidity out of the system and force a slowdown to lower inflation, the Biden administration keeps pumping borrowed money into the economy.

The contradiction between the Fed and the Biden White House increases the scale of government and shrinks the private sector. Furthermore, since the federal government is the world’s largest debtor, high interest rates translate into an even bigger federal deficit.

So, the long run consequences of Bidenomics on inflation is staggering. Measured from the time President Joe Biden took office, the prices Americans are paying have skyrocketed.In just three-and-a-half years, the price of eggs is up 49.3 percent, gasoline is up 47.5 percent, peanut butter is up 40 percent, butter and margarine are up 32 percent, electricity is up 28.3 percent, air fare is up 32.7 percent, used cars are up 20.9 percent—and the list continues.

The American people feel these price increases, and they are unhappy. Most Americans rate the economy as poor, while only 38 percent consider the economy is in good shape. (Under President Donald Trump, 65 percent rated the economy as good.)

As the Wall Street Journal editorialized:

“[I]f voters are downbeat about the economy, persistent inflation is a good reason. Price increases across the Biden Presidency are unlike anything Americans have seen in recent decades. They have been a particular shock for low-income and younger workers who haven’t accumulated a wealth cushion in the stock market or housing values.

“Mr. Biden is the main architect of his inflation problem—and ours.”

Mark Halperin with his usual insight asserted: “The story of who will win this election might just be that voters demand a change from the mind-boggling high cost of almost everything. The prices are just too damn high.”

As if inflation was not a big enough problem there is a an even bigger problem growing with the employment news.

As Matt Weidinger outlined inAEI Ideas:

“[I]n the past 12 months, employment among US natives is down by 651,000. Those declines were focused on men, a group President Biden already has increasing difficulties winning over.”

“In contrast, employment among foreign-born individuals grew by 1,266,000 in the past year, driven by the rapidly growing population of foreign-born individuals ages 16 and over in the US, which rose by almost 2.6 million during the past year. “

“The gap between US native and foreign-born employment is even starker since last summer. Since its peak in July 2023, employment of US natives has fallen by over 2.0 million, while employment of the foreign-born has risen by almost 1.4 million. “

From President Biden’s standpoint, Weidinger highlights a deadly detail:

“Friday’s jobs report reveals that unemployment among Black or African American individuals rose in March for the third consecutive month, to over 1.4 million, the highest level since January 2022. That group’s unemployment rate has risen from 5.1 percent to 6.4 percent in the past year.”

The jobs numbers contain even more problems for President Biden because part-time jobs are increasing much faster than full-time jobs.More and more Americans are finding themselves working two or three jobs—often with little or no benefits—just to make ends meet in an economy of constantly rising prices.

So, Bidenomics means rising prices, fewer jobs, more part-time employment, and a desperate sense that things are just not working.

Still, the propaganda media is trying hard to paint a pretty picture. CNN, for example, called the latest monthly jobs report a “blowout.”

But everyday Americans know when they go to the grocery store, pay monthly bills, or fill up their cars that life has gotten harder under President Biden.

The trademark of Bidenomics may be the steady shrinking of products. Take a Trump era candy bar or box of cereal and place it next to the same product today. In most cases, the price increased, and the unit size has shrunk.

Simply put: Bidenomics means you get less for more.

If this economic failure persists for another seven months—and it almost certainly will—then Bidenomics may be Biden’s downfall.

But basic human decency is dead these days, as was exemplified by a Venezuelan-born man named Yeixon Brito-Gonzalez, who was caught trying to rob a bank in Sandusky, Ohio last week, according toPJ Media.

The police were able to apprehend him because he couldn't speak English and resorted to using a translation app to communicate his demands to the bank tellers. When the tellers - probably wondering if they were being ""Punk'd"" - did not comply, Brito-Gonzalez, evidently embarrassed, simply left the scene, the report says.

The perp failed to prepare even basic English phrases like ""give me the money"" or bring an accomplice who could speak the language,the report says.

Upon locating Brito-Gonzalez, the police brought along a Spanish-speaking officer to interrogate him but he tried to play dumb.The report says it was later revealed that he told the teller he needed ""money in a bag"".

Sandusky Police Chief Jared Oliver said:

""I have been in law enforcement for over 20 years and this is the first time I encountered something like this, someone using a translator app to try and rob a bank. First time our officers have dealt with it too.""

It's has not been confirmed whether Brito-Gonzalez is in the U.S. illegally, though his lack of ID at arrest implies this might be the case.

Nevertheless, while federal authorities will likely question him,there are doubts about enforcement under the current administration,suggesting he may not face stringent consequences (as has been the running theme across the U.S. since Joe Biden has been in office).

Sandusky is a small city nestled along the shores of Lake Erie. Known primarily for its role as a major hub for rail and water transport, Sandusky has been a vital part of Ohio's economy since its establishment in 1818.

Take a step back (in time), and see that our neoliberal, debt-addled, was-lower-for-longer global system is not just in a Polycrisis butaPolybiusCrisis- referring to the ancient Greek historian.

Methodology:Polybius was first to argue ‘consider your source’: today, media and markets still spout and swallow propaganda. He argues we can’t look at history in just one area, as what happens everywhere effects what is going on everywhere else: but modern markets have monomanias for one asset class, geography, and ideology: markets-first neoliberalism.

Yet while 2024 opened with talk of 7 Fed cuts, then 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2, it just saw calls that US ratecutsare neededto lowerinflation (because of the slump in housing supply that recent US data won’t help); chatter of 2 ratehikes; andnowBloomberg asks,‘What if the Fed’s Hikes Are Actually Sparking an Economic Boom?’Is neoliberalism in crisis, or is this a new copium given Fed Chair Powell just said he’s prepared to keep rates steady “as long as needed”?

Bloomberg notes thathigh rates = stimulusis an MMT heresy, but huge budget deficits mean high rates put more cash into people’s pockets (as they take it from others’). Yet it’sfiscal deficits,not rate hikes, that do that trick, another neoliberal shibboleth.(And an MMT one: Stephanie Kelton argues rate hikes contribute to the deficit, so cutting them would lower it… as if supply-side inflation and speculation with new liquidity aren’t connected to rates.)

Meanwhile, trade and FX are next. Perhaps-futureUS Treasury Secretary Lighthizermocks the argument the US saves too little because Americans are profligate; (correctly) says low savings / large US trade deficits are caused by foreign industrial policy; forcing the trade deficit to narrow means savings would rise; and wants low corporate taxes, low regulation, subsidies, tariffs, and a “sensible” trade policy to fight mercantilism.If you don’t understand that throws global markets into a tailspin, like the economists Lighthizer mocks, you don’t understand that system.

On security:Polybius would not be surprised that today we have a failing global security architecture because US National Security Advisor Sullivan doesn’t say ‘Si vis pacem, para bellum’, but ‘Quaeso, sume prandium meum argentum!’ (“Please, take my lunch money!”) That approach was always going to lead to a Ukraine-Russia war, or similar; an Israel-Iran clash; and,in parallel and conflating with both, Taiwan-China tensions.

There is now frenetic activity to try to moderate any Israeli counterstrike on Iran to prevent a regional conflagration; Daniela Gabor tweets from the IMF/World Bank spring meeting, “geopolitical conflict is paralyzing everything… including on climate finance.”; and ECB President Lagarde says rate cuts are coming provided there are no inflation shocks(!)As I asked yesterday, ‘who leads and who is led?’ It’s no longer central banks.

On politics:Polybius argues societies start asochlocracy(mob rule); a strong leader startsmonarchy(rule by one: the ‘spare’ gets a Netflix deal); power turns this totyranny(‘democracy’, says the Ivy League); an elite revolution sets uparistocracy(rule by the best); they also lose virtue, and we getoligarchy(‘neoliberalism’ to everyone but economists); they get overthrown by the people fordemocracy(rule by the majority: ‘tyranny’ says the Ivy League); but people lack virtue, so this turns toochlocracy; and the cycle restarts. Polybius argues it’s best to combine monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy.

However, as we loom closer to the EU and US elections, and what populism may emerge, he’d probably repeat:“…enticing and corrupting the common people in every possible way… they have made the populace ready and greedy to receive bribes, the virtue of democracy is destroyed, and it is transformed into a government of violence and the strong hand. For the mob, habituated to feed at the expense of others, and to have its hopes of a livelihood in the property of its neighbours, as soon as it has got a leader sufficiently ambitious and daring… produces a reign of mere violence. Then come tumultuous assemblies, massacres, banishments, redivisions of land; until, after losing all trace of civilisation, it has once more found a master and a despot.”(Or ‘decolonisation’ as they call it at US Ivy League schools and on social media.)

On Great Power struggles: Polybius notesin less than a lifetimeRome went from city-state to the master of the world by winning the Punic Wars vs. Carthage.History can sometimes move fast:

A glance at Polybius underlines our Western neoliberal crisis. Consider his comments on good laws and customs in an election year where the leading US presidential candidate is in a New York courtroom charged with a crime some legal experts say is a misdemeanour, but with a stack of serious cases elsewhere, as allegations of double standards are thrown; and as Belgium tried to ban a political meeting involving former UK PM Truss and Nigel Farage for being dangerously ‘far right’: dangerously far out, maybe. Or look to Polybius’s views on corruption, as it spreads; religion, as religiosity falls; and on mercenaries, as the West’s willingness to fight for their own country evaporates, according to survey data, just as the need to fight grows more urgent.

Yet while Rome and the US both rose to power within a lifetime, the former went on for a great many more, becoming an empire that took more than 650 years to fall in the West, and another millennium in the East. Time may be on the West’s side yet. Could Western checks and balances help it find a new rallying cry like “somethingconstruenda est”?And as importantly, what is ‘Team Carthage’ doing? There are two sides to every Great Power struggle.

To summarize, however, reading biased reports not objective analysis; monomaniacal reports not broader thinking; ignoring the Classical world’s lessons on realpolitik; that how we run societies has been an issue for thousands of years, not since 2016; and that Great Power struggles are always with us, ensures you will swept away in a Polybius Crisis.Ancient wisdom isn’t perfect; but it’s arguably a lot better than relying on a contemporary world’s decidedlack of wisdom.

2024-04-17 22:40:00,"Forget Cocoa, Coffee. There's A ""Squeeze Risk"" Building In The Tin Market",https://web.archive.org/web/20240418105458/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/forget-cocoa-coffee-theres-squeeze-risk-building-tin-market#comment-stream,"Tin prices on the London Metal Exchange have surged 27% this year, landing on the radars of some institutional desks. Other commodities closely monitored by hedge funds include cocoa,coffee, Brent crude, copper, and gold.

Bloombergnotes that LME data for the tin market shows the aggregate net-long position held by financial investors surged to the highest level ever, with data going back to 2018.

These bullish bets have pushed tin prices well into the $32,000 handle in recent trading sessions.

Bloomberg notes that the ""big bull"" positioning by institutional investors comes as major supply disruptions hit top producers across Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Also, the metal, a critical component of modern technology and used primarily as solder to connect electrical components and semiconductor chips, is the latest AI trade investors have been piling into.

""Every data byte and every electron travels through hundreds of solder joints that connect it all together,"" Jeremy Pearce, head of market intelligence and communications at the International Tin Association, said in an email interview with the media outlet. He pointed out that tin's trade thesis is that demand will rise in tandem with AI computing demand at data centers. Recall our note,""The Next AI Trade.""

Like Nickel and other commodities, tin is prone to mega short squeezes. Traders discovered this in 2022 after a once-in-a-generation squeeze broke the nickel trading on LME.

""Some market participants feel there could be a risk of a squeeze,"" Ding Wenqiang, senior analyst at one of China's largest metal researchers, Mysteel.com, told Bloomberg. He added, ""They are paying close attention to the movements of the big bull in the May contract.""

Tightening supplies come as tin inventories plunged 47% so far this year to 4,045 tons. The metal's spot price trades at a premium versus the three-month futures contract, producing a structure known as backwardation.

Nickel prices are rising as commodity prices have likely based and entered a 'weak bull' market, according to newresearch from HSBC Bank.

Rising commodity prices are more bad news for Fed chair Powell's fight against the inflation monster.

2024-04-17 23:00:00,The Teachers' Unions Are More Political than Ever,https://web.archive.org/web/20240418105458/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/teachers-unions-are-more-political-ever#comment-stream,"Authored by Larry Sand via American Greatness,

In the past, teachers’ unions concentrated on fighting to keep all teachers employed—competent or otherwise—laying off teachers by seniority when necessary and soaking taxpayers every chance they could. While those activities are still part of their mission, they have, over time, increasingly delved into the political/social realm, promoting Black Lives Matter, Critical Race Theory, DEI, class warfare, gender-bending, etc. And their current level of engagement is staggering.

Americans for Fair Treatment, a national nonprofit organization that educates public employees about their rights in a unionized workplace, recentlyreleased a report detailing the National Education Association’s (NEA) financial filings from Sept. 1, 2022, through Aug. 31, 2023.

The NEA declared that its political spending totaled $50.1 million during the fiscal year, though the true number is much higher. During the most recent reporting period, the union disclosed that it spent “$126.3 million on ‘contributions, gifts, and grants,’ which is where most unions detail their charitable giving.”

However, a closer look at the union’s “contributions, gifts, and grants” shows that the NEA is directing more money towards political causes than it reports. For example, the union contributed $4.1 million to the State Engagement Fund, a progressive advocacy group, and $3.5 million to For Our Future, a Democratic super PAC. Another $500,000 was donated to the Color of Change Education Fund, which has ties to progressive billionaire George Soros.

The disclosure alsoreveals that the union spent $10 million more on politics and lobbying than it did representing its members. While NEA’s representational spending increased by about $2 million compared to the previous reporting period, spending on politics and lobbying increased by $8.5 million.

It’s worth noting that as a 501(c)(5), the NEA and, in fact, all unions have a special tax-exempt status with the IRS, which is accorded to “Labor, Agricultural, and Horticultural Organizations.”

Local teachers’ unions are also involved in political spending. In Chicago, where just15% of Chicago’s 8th-grade studentsare proficient in math and21% are proficient in reading,the Chicago Teachers Union is focused on other things. Asthe Illinois Policy Institute documents, the union spentnearly three times more on politicsin 2023 than the year before, andjust 17%of its spending was on representing teachers.

A142-page leaked documentcontains hundreds of Chicago Teachers Union contract demands, including 100% abortion coverage to pay for surrogates and housing students in old schools.

The CTU is alsodemanding a 100% electric bus fleetand fuel-efficient drivers’ education vehicles, installation of solar panels and other facility upgrades, compensation, and medical benefits for absences related to “verbal assault,” etc.

In preparing for CTU’s collective bargaining talks with the city, the union’s president, Stacy Davis Gates, asserted the new contract wouldcost taxpayers $50 billion.

Importantly, the teachers’ unions’ political involvement does not stop with spending. They now routinely make policy statements and demands, most notably on the recent strife in the Middle East.

In November,the United Educators of San Francisco contendedthat Israel’s military campaign violated the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights but made no mention of the brutal Oct. 7 attacks or the captivity of over 200 hostages.

In December, a pro-Palestinian “teach-in” was organized by theOakland Education Association, and members developed special lesson plans indefiance of the local school board. The same month, Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, demanded a permanent truce in the Middle Easton Twitter—a positionthat was later reaffirmedby the organization’s board of directors.

In late January, theAmerican Federation of Teachersofficially called for a cessation of hostilities.

Additionally, Heritage Foundation scholarJay Greenereports that a measure adopted by the NEA-affiliated Massachusetts Teachers Association board in Decemberdeclared, “The MTA president and vice president will urge the president of the NEA to pressure President Biden to stop funding and sending weapons in support of the Netanyahu government’s genocidal war on the Palestinian people in Gaza.”

Greene also notes that the executive committee of the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers passed a resolution condemning “the system of Israeli occupation and apartheid.” However, backlash from teachers and the community led the union to issue an apology.

What can be done about the onslaught of union political activity?

The big-picture solution is for teachers’ unions to be banned. Period.

“All government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service. It has its distinct and insurmountable limitations when applied to public personnel management.”

Progressive icon Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued the above caveat about government unions. Additionally,George Meany, president of the AFL-CIO for 24 years, once stated, “It is impossible to bargain collectively with the government.”

Both men understood that the very nature of government makes it wrong for its leaders to negotiate with any union. When government unions bargain, they often sit across the table from people they helped put in office with generous campaign contributions. And when these unions go on strike, they walk out on the taxpayer.

However, getting rid of these established unions is highly unlikely, primarily because political spending by government unions inevitably favors union-friendly candidates.

Prohibiting collective bargaining wouldreduce union power, but only five states currently prohibit that activity for public employees: Texas, Arkansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.

Ultimately, teachers hold the key. If they stopped paying dues, the unions would cease to exist. Legally, they can now do so courtesy of the Supreme Court’s 2018Janusdecision, which asserted that no teacher or any public employee has to pay a penny to a union as a condition of employment.

The good news is that since the SCOTUS ruling, 20% of workers in non-right-to-work states have dropped out of their unions, according to areportfrom the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. The bad news is that70% of teachersnationwide still willingly pay union dues.

As a teacher, if your politics are on the right, centrist, or maybe you are apolitical, do you really want hundreds of your dues dollars going to the leftist causes that the state and national unions regularly support?

It is with no sense of irony that NEA boss Becky Pringle asserts that politics’ “creeping influence” in classrooms threatens education. “All of the politicians and pundits who are trying to politicize our school demonize teachers, which is new, who are not focused on what our kids need or what our parents say they want for their kids.”

Pringle has it backward. Clearly, the number one educational “influence creeps” are the teachers’ unions.

Larry Sand, a retired 28-year classroom teacher, is the president of the non-profitCalifornia Teachers Empowerment Network– a non-partisan, non-political group dedicated to providing teachers and the general public with reliable and balanced information about professional affiliations and positions on educational issues. The views presented here are strictly his own.

2024-04-17 23:20:00,The Top 10 Most Cost-Effective Countries To Get A High-Priced Higher Education,https://web.archive.org/web/20240418105458/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/top-10-most-cost-effective-countries-get-high-priced-higher-education,"A new study byOnline Gaming Groupshas evaluated over 30 countries to determine the most cost-effective higher education systems, focusing on the percentage of average annual income spent on educational expenses.

This analysis included countries with the highest university fees, and additional costs such as living and rent were considered to accurately assess the full financial commitment needed for education.

By examining the ratio of costs to salary,the study ranked these nations. Belgium emerged as the leader, offering the most cost-effective higher education. In contrast, Israel was noted for having the highest educational expenses on the list, despite having the fewest universities and the lowest quality of higher education.

Belgium tops the list of countries offering the most cost-effective higher education, with annual expenses, including tuition fees, averaging $28,574. The average annual salary in Belgium is $53,890, with 53.02% of this salary spent on living and university expenses. This balance between earning and learning costs underscores the country's commitment to making education accessible.

Switzerland ranks second, with average annual expenses of $51,013 and an average salary of $95,490, dedicating 53.42% of salary to education and living costs. Despite having the highest living costs in the ranking, Switzerland's substantial average salary helps mitigate these expenses, making its education system remarkably cost-effective.

In third place, South Korea presents a contrast with more affordable living conditions and a lower average salary of $36,190. Here, 61.01% of the salary goes towards education and living expenses, with the country having the highest education costs among the top three.

The Netherlands, fourth on the list, has annual expenses of $37,697 against an average salary of $60,230, spending 62.59% of it on education and living costs. The country ensures broad accessibility to higher education with relatively moderate educational costs.

France is fifth, balancing university and living costs against an average yearly salary of $45,290. With 63.50% of the salary allocated to these costs, France maintains a balance between accessible education and high educational quality.

Ireland follows as the sixth most cost-effective country for higher education, with average expenses of $55,129 and a salary of $79,730, dedicating 69.14% of it to education and living. Despite not having the highest costs, the cumulative annual expenses are considerable.

Japan ranks seventh, where 70.14% of the average annual salary of $42,440 is spent on higher education, indicating a premium level of education, as evidenced by the high number of universities and education costs.

Italy, eighth, spends 70.51% of an average salary of $38,200 on education, reflecting the country's rich educational heritage and the high quality of its education system, ranked 14th worldwide.

Australia is ninth, requiring families and students to invest significantly in education, with 72.97% of the $60,840 average salary going toward educational and living expenses, indicative of the country's high standards of living and educational quality.

Lastly, Israel, despite having the highest education costs on the list and ranking lowest in the number of universities and education quality,spends 78.97% of the average salary of $55,140 on education, rounding off the list of the top ten countries with cost-effective higher education.

2024-04-18 02:00:00,The Polish President Revealed That Foreign Companies Own Most Of Ukraine's Industrial Agriculture,https://web.archive.org/web/20240418105458/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/polish-president-revealed-foreign-companies-own-most-ukraines-industrial-agriculture,"Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

The Oakland Institute published a detailed report in February 2023 titled “War and Theft: The Takeover of Ukraine’s Agricultural Land”, whichexposed how foreign firms have clandestinely taken control of a significant share of Ukrainian farmland by exploiting a liberal law in collusion with local oligarchs. Their findings made waves around the world at the time but eventually receded from the public’s attention over half a year later once Western outlets like theUSA Todaymisleadingly “fact-checked” it.

They took advantage of social media users conflating indirect ownership through stakes with direct control to discredit the institution’s report, after which it largely faded from the general discourse. Few could have expected that it would be none other than Polish President Andrzej Duda who just breathed new life into it during his interview withLithuanian National Radio and Television. He was explaining Poland’s problem with Ukrainian agricultural imports when he dropped the following bombshell:

“I would like to draw particular attention to industrial agriculture, which is not really run by Ukrainians, it is run by big companies from Western Europe, from the USA. If we look today at the owners of most of the land, they are not Ukrainian companies. This is a paradoxical situation, and no wonder that farmers are defending themselves, because they have invested in their farms in Poland […] and cheap agricultural produce coming from Ukraine is dramatically destructive to them.”

Duda represents what’s widely considered to be one of the most pro-American and anti-Russian governments at any time in history so he can’t credibly be accused of “pushing Kremlin propaganda”.

He therefore wouldn’t have confirmed the dramatic claim of majority-foreign ownership of Ukraine’s industrial agriculture, albeit indirectly through stakes in national companies that exploit a liberal law in collusion with local oligarchs, if he didn’t have the facts provided to him by Polish experts to back it up.

This development should prompt a resurgence of interest in prior reports on this subject such as USAID’s about how “Private Sector on the Frontlines of Land Reform to Unlock Ukraine’s Investment Potential”. Thomas Fazi’s detailed report for UnHeard back in July 2023 about how “The capitalists are circling over Ukraine: The war is creating massive profit opportunities” is also insightful. Most relevant, however, is what Zelensky told the World Economic Forum in Davos in May 2022.In his words:

“We offer a special - historically significant - model of reconstruction. When each of the partner countries or partner cities or partner companies will have the opportunity - historical one - to take patronage over a particular region of Ukraine, city, community or industry. Britain, Denmark, the European Union and other leading international actors have already chosen a specific direction for patronage in reconstruction.”

One year later, he hosted BlackRock’s management in Kiev, during which time they discussed the creation of an investment and reconstruction fund.According to Zelensky, “Today is a historic moment because, since the very first days of independence, we have not had such huge investment cases in Ukraine. We are proud that we can initiate such a process…We will be able to offer interesting projects to invest in energy, security, agriculture, logistics, infrastructure, medicine, IT, and many other areas.”

Putting the pieces together, the Ukrainian leader made good on his May 2022 Davos proposal by offering companies “patronage” over Ukraine’s industrial agriculture, which was already in the process of unfolding prior to then but was greatly accelerated by last May’s meeting with BlackRock’s management.This took the tangible form of these indirectly foreign-controlled farms outcompeting Poland’s by far, thus leading to thePolish farmers’ protests across the countryand the latest troubles in bilateral ties.

The sequence of events detailed thus far places into context mid-February’s report about the G7’s alleged plans toappoint an envoyto Ukraine, who’d obviously be tasked with implementing the Davos agenda if this comes to pass, particularly entrenching foreign control over Ukrainian farmland. It also suggests that Ukraine’s informal focus on ramping up agricultural exports to the EU isn’t just opportunistic, but partially driven by these foreign firms’ preference for speedy and reliable profits.

Ukraine had hitherto been an agricultural powerhouse in the Global South but ceded its market share to Russia on the false pretext that Moscow was blockading the Black Sea, which in turn prompted the EU to temporarily eliminate prior trade barriers for the official purpose of facilitating exports via its territory. In reality, Russia never blockaded the Black Sea, and almost all of the Ukrainian grain that entered the EU remained there instead of traveling through the bloc en route to Kiev’s traditional Global South markets.

It's much quicker for Ukraine to sell its agricultural products in the neighboring EU than to wait however long it takes to export them to Africa, not to mention more reliable as well since it’s unimaginable that these developed economies would ever have the same possible payment problems as developing ones. These self-evident calculations work against Poland’s interests, ergo how much of a struggle it’ll be for that country to defend its domestic market from this influx considering the powerful forces at play.

It's not just the Ukrainian agricultural lobby that wants tariff-free access for these products into the EU market, but also the lobbies of those foreign firms that indirectly control its industrial agriculture. The latter will likely fight tooth and nail toprevent any compromisebeing reached on Ukraine’s hoped-for EU membership whereby that former Soviet Republic’s agricultural sector would be excluded from any deal. Poland therefore has every reason to continue drawing global attention to these shadowy relationships.

It's only by raising maximum awareness of the fact that “most of the land” within Ukraine’s industrial agriculture sector “is run by big companies from Western Europe, from the USA” that Poland stands any chance of the aforesaid compromise entering into force.That’ll make the country some very powerful enemies who could then meddle in Polish domestic affairs out of vengeance, but Duda’s latest interview suggests that he’s prepared to face their wrath in order to protect Poland’s objective national interests.

2024-04-18 02:45:00,UN Security Council To Hold Contentious Vote On Palestinian Statehood,https://web.archive.org/web/20240418105458/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/un-security-council-hold-contentious-vote-palestinian-statehood#comment-stream,"Friday will witness another Gaza-related showdown in a very divided United Nations Security Council, as council member Algeria has prepared a draftresolution for the body recognize a Palestinian state.

It would require nine votes and no vetoes on the part of the US, Britain, France, Russia or China in order to pass - which means it won't happen, given the US as a close ally of Israel is expected to surely block it. The plan ultimately seeks to bestow on Palestinefull UN membership status.

Looking ahead to the vote, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Wednesday: ""We do not see that doing a resolution in the Security Council will necessarily get us to a place where we can find ... a two-state solution moving forward.""

The US position has long been that a Palestinian state must be born out direct negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians, and not accomplished superficially within an external forum like the UN.

Israel has clearlyrejected that it will allow for a Palestinian state so long as Hamas still exists, and PM Netanyahu has even linked the more secular-leaning Palestinian Authority in the West Bank to 'terrorism'. He has also rejected a prior US call to allow the PA to take over and administer the Gaza Strip. The reality is that the current Gaza war makes the prospect of achieving a Palestinian state more distant than ever.

According to some background viaReuters:

The Palestinians are currently a non-member observer state, a de facto recognition of statehood that was granted by the 193-member UN General Assembly in 2012. But an application to become a full UN member needs to be approved by the Security Council and then at least two-thirds of the General Assembly.

The UN Security Council has long endorsed a vision of two states living side by side within secure and recognized borders. Palestinians want a state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip, all territory captured by Israel in 1967.

The UK too has long said it will not recognize Palestine outside of a broader deal for a two-state solution that involves Israeli assent.

Spain was the most recent country to unilaterally recognize Palestine as a state, which wasannounced earlierthis month. Those EU states to have previously done soincludePoland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. Ireland and Malta have also recently said they are on board and plan to do so.

Leaked Cables Show White House Opposes Palestinian Statehoodhttps://t.co/tzVB9Y20f2by@kenklippenstein,@DRBoguslawhttps://t.co/tzVB9Y20f2

The current war in Gaza and soaring civilian death toll among Palestinians as Israel continues its operation seeking to eradicate Hamas and free the hostages has given extra impetus to those officials in Europe who have wanted to see Palestinian recognition.

2024-04-18 03:30:00,Desperation Behind European Politicians' Latest Russiagate Hoax,https://web.archive.org/web/20240418105458/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/desperation-behind-european-politicians-latest-russiagate-hoax#comment-stream,"Authored by Peter Sourek, Cecile Jilkova, and Michael Shellenberg via Public Substack,

The success of right-wing German political party AfD led European politicians to abuse their powers, perhaps illegally...

European Commission Vice President Věra Jourová (left) Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Fiala (center); President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen (right)

European politicians claimed late last month that Russia bribed European politicians to spread disinformation and interfere in the upcoming June elections.“Russian influence scandal rocks EU,”screamed a March 30 Politico headline.

Russia “is using dodgy outlets pretending to be media [and] using money to buy covert influence,”claimedEuropean Commission Vice President Věra Jourová.

TheBBC agreed:“Russian network that 'paid European politicians' busted, authorities claim.”

Heads of state hyped the alleged scandal.

“We uncovered a pro-Russian network,”claimedPetr Fiala, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, “that was developing an operation to spread Russian influence and undermine security across Europe.”

Poland's intelligence agencysaidit had conducted searches in the Warsaw and Tychy regions and seized €48,500 (£41,500) and $36,000 (£28,500).

However, following aninvestigationby Public, the head of the Czech Intelligence Agency (BIS), Michal Koudelka on Mondayadmitted thathis agency has no information about any bribery scheme.

""I cannot confirm anything,”he said.

It’s true that Russia's media influence in Europe intensified considerably during the Covid-19 pandemic. At that time, a number of marginalized voices found space on the German broadcasts of the Kremlin's propaganda television, Russia Today, which the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, promptly shut down in 2022.

But von der Leyen has conceded that there is no proof of a Russian bribery network.

“They have carried [Putin’s] propaganda into our societies,” shesaid. “Whether they have taken bribes for it or not.”

Public asked von der Leyen what evidence she has for her allegations. What was the misconduct or illegal activity if there were no bribes?

After two weeks of hysteria, the German media are now backing away from the claim that right-wing nationalist politicians with the Alternative for Democracy (AfD) party in Germany took money from the Russians.

The mainstream German media are now claiming, like von der Leyen, that it doesn't matter if the politicians took any Russian money since they do what the Russians want.

All of this raises questions about the motivations behind Europe’s latest Russiagate disinformation campaign.

Why are European leaders so desperate to smear their political enemies as Russian puppets that they were willing to potentially break the law by weaponizing intelligence agencies and interfering in elections?

The European Russiagate hoax is but a two-week window of cheap spy tales per country. Desperate incumbents try to make the most of this one-in-campaign opportunity.

The Belgian Prime Minister is right (tongue in cheek): We must be vigilant! It is important that truly independent media do not let politicians abuse their power and run this bleak hoax any higher.

2024-04-18 04:15:00,Russia Restoring Oil Refining Capacity After Ukrainian Suicide Drone Strikes,https://web.archive.org/web/20240418105458/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/russia-restoring-oil-refining-capacity-ukrainian-suicide-drones,"With Western sanctions widely failing against Russia, as well as Ukraine's depleted air force unable to patrol its skies, Western leaders have said General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets would be game-changing in the war (these are the same leaders that said the M1 Abrams tanks would be game-changing). But with M1 Abrams busted and F-16s unlikely to hit the highly contested airspace of the Eastern European country anytime soon, desperate Kyiv made a bold effort in recent months to target Moscow's crude refineries (how the war is funded) with wave after wave of stealthy suicide drones.

For months, Ukraine and the Western leaders (and the CIA) cheered (either publicly in NATO-friendly corporate press or behind the scenes) about bombing Russia's refineries deep within the country with suicide drones, sending crude refining capacity-idled in the country to nearly 14%.

However, the short-lived celebrations are winding down.Reutersestimates that capacity idled at refineries in Russia fell from 14% to 10% at the end of March, primarily because the refineries are being repaired quickly.

Reuters noted several damaged Russian refinery plants that were hit by Ukrainian drone attacks have been fixed in recent weeks. Also, other refineries with planned maintenance have come back online.

That includes the Rosneft-owned Ryazan plant, which put back the CDU-4 and main CDU-6 primary oil refining units into operation, as well as Kuibyshev refinery repairing CDU-4 and Syzran's CDU-5 and previously idled for maintenance CDU-6.-Reuters

According to Reuters estimates, Russian oil refining capacity idled by drones plunged to 90,500 metric tons per day (660,000 barrels per day) from around 123,800 tons per day (907,000 bpd) previously.

The last major Ukrainian drone attack on a large Russian refinery facility occurred on April 2 at the Taneco refinery in Nizhnekamsk, Russia,the third-largest refinery in the country.

Reuters pointed out that Russia's total primary oil refining capacity was shut down due to outages, and maintenance was around 4.4 million tons in April, up from 4.1 million tons in March.

Since April 2, there have been no new reports of successful drone attacks on large Russian refineries.

We wonder why? Well, it's pretty easy to figure this one out.

Last week, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Ukraine that drone and missile attacks should not be focused on energy infrastructure but instead on military targets because of the risk of sending Brent crude prices over $100 per barrel.

And recall this note from last month,""""Terrified"" Joe Biden Demands Ukraine Halt Strikes On Russian Refiners As It Is Sending Oil Prices Surging.""

Ukraine only attacking Russian refineries with drones instead of sinking Russian tankers as that would send oil soaring and would cripple Biden re-election odds.Once Trump wins, Ukraine will go scorched earth on Russian oil infra/tankers.

The main goal of the refinery drone attacks by Ukraine is to crush Moscow's funding of the war through crude product (such as diesel) exports. The quick repair work and resilience of the Russian economy from repeated Ukranian attacks and Western sanctions shows how elites in Washington and Brussels are failing in a world dangerously spiraling into a multi-polar state.

If Biden's foreign policy is basically to keep Brent prices sub $100/bbl before the presidential elections in November. Well, they're going to have a whole lot oftrouble if Israel uses Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth jetsto bomb critical oil/gas infrastructure in Iran.

2024-04-18 05:00:00,The European Commission Is Preparing To Sue Germany Over Its Gas Tariffs,https://web.archive.org/web/20240418105458/https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/european-commission-preparing-sue-germany-over-its-gas-tariffs,"Authored by Charles Kennedy via OilPrice.com,

Unnamed Reuters sources said on Wednesday that the European Commission is preparing to sue Germany over its fees for purchasing gas from German storage in contravention of the European Union’s single market rules.

In a matter of days, the European Commission is expected to file its infringement procedure lawsuit against the German tariff, Reuters reports, citing two unnamed sources, though a spokesman for the Commission told Reuters that talks were ongoing.

The tariff, according to an EU energy regulator who spoke with Reuters, is creating higher gas prices in some EU countries.

Germany’s tariff on purchases of stored gas is a relatively new development that arose out of the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine when the EU banned imports of piped Russian gas, and in the wake of the shut-down of the Nord Stream pipeline, connecting Russia and Germany.

Germany is accused of using its neighbors to fill in a fiscal gap created by the need for Germany to fill its storage with more expensive, non-Russian gas.

That fee has tripled–at a minimum–since its implementation in October 2022, according to Reuters.

According to some members of the EU, the bloc’s single market rules do not allow for trade tariffs among its members.

""We remain in touch with the German authorities on this matter, including at political level...we do not speculate on the possible opening of infringement procedures,""a spokesperson for the Commission told Reuters, while an Economy Ministry spokesperson claimed the tariff was in the spirit of “European security” by enabling Germany to fill its storage.

On Tuesday, the Austrian Vice President of the European Parliament, Othmar Karas, and Austrian Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler challenged Germany’s gas transit tariffs before the European Commission, alleging that the higher fees made it more difficult for some of the bloc’s eastern members to give up Russian gas.

The end result, according to Austrian authorities, is that Austrians and other members of the bloc–mostly Eastern European–are footing the bill for the billions of cubic meters of gas Germany purchased when prices were high.

That gas must now be sold at a lower price, Euractiv reports.

2024-04-18 05:45:00,Gold Vs. S&P 500: Which Has Grown More Over Five Years?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240418105458/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/gold-vs-sp-500-which-has-grown-more-over-five-years,"Gold is considered a unique asset due to its enduring value,historical significance, and application in various technologies like computers, spacecraft, and communications equipment.

Commonly regarded as a “safe haven asset”, gold is something investors typically buy to protect themselves during periods of global uncertainty and economic decline.

It is for this reason that gold has performed rather strongly in recent years, and especially in 2024. Persistent inflation combined with multiple wars has driven up demand for gold, helping it set a new all-time high of over $2,400 per ounce.

To put this into perspective,Visual Capitalist's Marcus Luvisualized the performance of gold alongside the S&P 500.

See the table below for performance figures as of April 12, 2024.

Over the five-year period, gold has climbed an impressive 81.65%, outpacing even the S&P 500.

Perhaps a sign of how high the demand for gold is becoming, wholesale giant Costco is reportedly selling up to$200 millionworth of gold bars every month in the United States. The year prior, sales only amounted to $100 million per quarter.

Consumers aren’t the only ones buying gold, either. Central banks around the world have beenaccumulating goldin very large quantities, likely as a hedge against inflation.

According to the World Gold Council, these institutions bought 1,136 metric tons in 2022, marking the highest level since 1950. Figures for 2023 came in at 1,037 metric tons.

2024-04-18 06:30:00,US Submits 'Assurances' To UK Govt Over Assange Extradition,https://web.archive.org/web/20240418105458/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/us-submits-assurances-uk-govt-over-assange-extradition#comment-stream,"The United States Embassy on Tuesday filed two assurances with the British Foreign Office saying it would not seek the death penalty against imprisonedWikiLeakspublisher Julian Assange and would allow Assange “the ability to raise and seek to reply upon at trial … the rights and protections given under the First Amendment,” according to the U.S. diplomatic note.

Assange’s wife Stella Assange said the note “makes no undertaking to withdraw the prosecution’s previous assertion that Julian has no First Amendment rights because he is not a U.S citizen. Instead,” she said,“the US has limited itself to blatant weasel words claiming that Julian can ‘seek to raise’ the First Amendment if extradited.”

The note contains a hollow statement, namely, that Assange can try to raise the First Amendment at trial (and at sentencing),but the U.S. Department of Justice can’t guarantee he would get those rights, which is precisely what it must do under British extradition law based on the European Convention on Human Rights.

The U.S. Department of Justice is legally restricted to assure a free speech guarantee to Assange equivalent to Article 10 of the European Convention, which the British court isboundto follow. But without that assurance, Assange should be freed according to a British Crown Prosecution Servicecommenton extraditions.

InUSAID v. Alliance for Open Society,the U.S. Supreme Courtruledin 2020 that non-U.S. citizens outside the U.S. don’t possess constitutional rights. Both former C.I.A. Director Mike Pompeo and Gordon Kromberg, Assange’s U.S. prosecutor, have said Assange does not have First Amendment protection.

Because of the separation of powers in the United States, the executive branch’s Justice Department can’t guarantee to the British courts what the U.S. judicial branch decides about the rights of a non-U.S. citizen in court, said Marjorie Cohn, law professor and former president of the National Lawyers’ Guild.

“Let’s assume that … the Biden administration, does give assurances that he would be able to raise the First Amendment and that the [High] Court found that those were significant assurances,” CohntoldConsortium News'webcastCN Live! last month.

“That really doesn’t mean anything,because one of the things that the British courts don’t understand is the U.S. doctrine of separation of powers,” she said.  “The prosecutors can give all the assurances they want, but the judiciary, another [one] .. of these three branches of government in the U.S., doesn’t have to abide by the executive branch claim or assurance,” Cohn said.

In other words, whether Assange can rely on the First Amendment in his defense in a U.S. court is up to that court not Kromberg or the Department of Justice, which issued the assurance on Tuesday. “The United States has issued a non-assurance in relation to the First Amendment,” said Stella Assange.

Assange Can Challenge Assurances

Assange’s legal team now has the right to challenge the credibility and validity of the U.S. assurances filed on Tuesday. The U.S. would then have a right to reply to Assange’s legal submissions to the court, which will hold a hearing on May 20 to determine whether or not to accept the U.S. assurances.

If the court does, Assange can be put on a plane to the U.S. theoretically that day. If not Assange would be granted a full appeal against the Home Office’s 2022 order to extradite him.  Assange is wanted in the U.S. on 17 charges under the 1917 Espionage Act and one on conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. He faces up to 175 years in a U.S. dungeon.

“The diplomatic note does nothing to relieve our family’s extreme distress about his future — his grim expectation of spending the rest of his life in isolation in US prison for publishing award-winning journalism,” Stella Assange said.

BREAKING:“The United States has issued a non-assurance in relation to the First Amendment, and a standard assurance in relation to the death penalty. It makes no undertaking to withdraw the prosecution's previous assertion that Julian has no First Amendment rights because he…pic.twitter.com/lu7bkw0M5u

In its 66-page ruling on March 26, the two High Court judges wrote Kromberg wouldn’t have said Assange would be without First Amendment rights at trial “unless that was a tenable argument that the prosecution was entitled to deploy with a real prospect of success.”

“If such an argument were to succeed it would (at least arguably) cause the applicant [Assange] prejudice on the grounds of his non-US citizenship (and hence, on the grounds of his nationality),” the judges said. They added:

“The applicant wishes to argue, at any trial in the United States, that his actions were protected by the First Amendment. He contends that if he is given First Amendment rights, the prosecution will be stopped. The First Amendment is therefore of central importance to his defence to the extradition charge.”

This is the statement Stella Assange put out on X Tuesday at 11:36 am EDT...

“The United States has issued a non-assurance in relation to the First Amendment, and a standard assurance in relation to the death penalty. It makes no undertaking to withdraw the prosecution’s previous assertion that Julian has no First Amendment rights because he is not a U.S citizen. Instead, the US has limited itself to blatant weasel words claiming that Julian can ‘seek to raise’ the First Amendment if extradited. The diplomatic note does nothing to relieve our family’s extreme distress about his future — his grim expectation of spending the rest of his life in isolation in US prison for publishing award-winning journalism. The Biden Administration must drop this dangerous prosecution before it is too late.”

2024-04-18 06:35:00,"""War In The Middle East"": Opinions Clash In The 'Iran, Israel, Palestine' Debate",https://web.archive.org/web/20240418105458/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/prager-cenk-smith-face-zerohedge-debate-over-israel-iran,"This weekend marked a major escalation in the long-running conflict between Israel and Iran, with the latter launching what some called a ""performative"" barrage of missiles at Israel amid the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Iran says the matter is ""concluded"" (for now) but remains ""in a state of readiness"" to deliver a ""massive and harsh response"" if Israel launches the ""tiniest invasion,"" while Israel's former chief of Mossad, Zohar Palti, warned that striking Iranian nuclear facilities ""is on the table.""

The UK, France, and Germany have sent top-ranking diplomats to Israel in order to urge de-escalation of the crisis, while the Biden administration is also said to be not be on board with Israel directly striking back on the Islamic Republic. PM Netanyahu, however, said 'we will make our own decisions' on security.

Meanwhile, there is no hope in sight for any resolution on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Palestine where an unprecedented humanitarian crisis has erupted.

On April 17th,ZeroHedge hosted a debate on the issue: participants discussed everything from how the Biden administration should (or should not) respond, to whether Israel's actions in Gaza, Syria and Lebanon are morally justified vs. the actions of Hamas.

2024-04-18 12:27:00,"Third Temple, Inc.: The Eschatology Driving Israel's Temple Movement",https://web.archive.org/web/20240419124149/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-18/third-temple-inc-eschatology-driving-israels-temple-movement,"While the world waits with bated breath for the potential escalation of a conflict between Israel and Iran that has set the trajectory for a world war that could culminate in a nuclear apocalypse,Israel finds itself in the midst of another apocalyptic narrative, though one that is far more esoteric.With Passover approaching at a time where strife between the Jewish and Islamic worlds is more dire than ever, it appears that the state of Israel may be on the precipice of sanctioning a ritual intent on fulfilling the prophecy Jews hold regarding the revelation of their Messiah. The performance of that ritual is sought after by Israel's Temple Movement, which demonstrates how Judaism is a driving force behind the politics of Israel despite the contention by its allies that the country is exceptional for being a modern secular democracy in a region where it is surrounded by radical theocracies.

The Red Heifer sacrifice seems to be set for 4/22. In the Hebrew lunar calendar that's 14 Nisan 5784 (and Nisan is the first month which means the Solar Eclipse fell on the 1st day of the 1st month).There's a lot in alignment here. So as we've seen the Grand Lodge of…pic.twitter.com/CaQTyV3LUr

According to various media outlets, Jewish groups in Israel are preparing the sacrifice of a red heifer on the Mount Of Olives overlooking the Temple Mount.Speculation is that the sacrifice will take place on April 22nd during Passover in an act that Judaism deems is necessary to purify the ground on which the Third Temple must be built to bring forth their Messiah.The purification of the ground the Third Temple would require the destruction of the Al Aqsa Mosque which stands there now. Looking to materialize that prophecy will not only to provoke even more religious and cultural strife between Jews and Muslims in Israel and throughout the world but increase volatility in a region whose political instability represents perhaps the greatest threat to the mankind today.

The dictate requiring the sacrifice of the red heifer is part of a ritual set in chapter 19 of the Book Of Numbers,The Red Heifer And The Cleaning Waters, which deems that ""a red heifer without defect or blemish and that has never been under a yoke"" must be sacrificed before the temple can rise again.Performing that sacrificewas the impetus behind Uvne Jerusalem importing 5 red angus cattle from the Texas in 2022.To circumvent export laws preventing US cattle exports to Israel, Uvne Jerusalem member Yitshak Mamo declared the red heifers as his pets, undertaking an arduous task to bring them to the Holy Land and prepare them for sacrifice. Uvne Jerusalem is one of many groups encompassed by the Temple Movement that has swept across Israel. The mission of these groups is to advance the the creation of the Third Temple which itself is preceded by the sacrifice of the red heifer to purify the temple mount. The accomplishment of stage one of that mission appears to be on the horizon according to others in the Temple Movement.

According to Michael Samuel Smith, a Christian preacher and member of Temple Movement group Boneh Israel, the time to complete that sacrifice is now as the red heifers have finally come of age. Smith opined “This is the first time in nearly 2,000 years a successful red heifer has come about...It is still our opinion the first successful red heifer sacrifice will take place in the spring of 2024 around the Passover to Pentecost timeframe.We believe God is going to reveal himself through the efforts of this future event. It is truly a sign of the times, most especially for Jews in Israel.” In doing so, the Temple Movement hopes to fulfill the prophecy of Jewish eschatology to bring forth its messiah.

Eschatology is defined as the theological study concerning the end of days.More broadly, its definition can be expanded to refer to the beliefs within a particular religious dogma that espouse how mankind's destiny will be realized at the advent of the apocalypse. As demonstrated by the earliest evidence of theology in recorded history, this facet of religion is ubiquitous across belief systems from the polytheism of ancient times to the Abrahamic religions that have served as the foundation for western and middle eastern society in modernity. While each respective religion differs in their eschatological beliefs, none would assert that the others are nonexistent despite the inherent opposition they would have to their validity.

The secular world would object to both those premises, seeing the theological specialization as nothing more than an absurd belief system that should have been anachronized long before humanity entered into of the age of the rationality.Yet, by wholly dismissing eschatology, secularists close themselves off to an important consideration driving the foundations of many modern political ideologies.Although prophecies on the end of the world do not exist in their eyes, dismissing them entirely overlooks the irrefutable material reality that the belief of those who do ascribe to eschatology is a force that has driven the course of history and continues to til this very day, as evidenced by the Temple Movement and its calls for the sacrifice of the red heifer.

Update on the Red Heifer situation. It's happening and they have built the sacrificial altar...so there's that.https://t.co/sl6rX16swqoh yea, the ""Season of Sacrifice"" [1]. the occultists are gonna go nuts arent they?[1]https://t.co/QSfdWaSnhBThis year's SoS gonna be LIThttps://t.co/WaRWOY3oK5pic.twitter.com/vaXZ8btnQY

This oversight may not be more apparent than in respect to Zionism. Despite the inextricable tie to Judaism as the foundation for the creation and sustained existence of the state of Israel, Zionism is almost always perceived through a completely secular lens. Instead of dogma and doctrine being considerations for the evaluation people have on Israeli history and politics, those tenets are superseded by secularized cultural aspects representing the Jewish ethnos. However, that perspective is not only limited but naive in understanding the mission Zionist ultimately espouses.One needn't look further than the direct rhetoric coming from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to see the obvious religiously driven motives behind his policy making.This is apparent from Netanyahu repeatedly drawing from the Book Of Samuel to refer to Hamas as ""Amalek"" as if it is his destiny to be a steward of the promise to destroy them made long ago in the early days of deuteronomistic history.

What the Temple Movement now focused on sacrificing the red heifer shows in conjunction with the rhetoric coming from the Netanyahu regime is that the permeation of Jewish eschatology driving the body politic of Israel is more prevalent than the rhetoric confined to the Israel-Hamas war. The magnitude of that force not only resonates in the Jewish diaspora but in the Islamic world which is diametrically opposed to these developments.Those reverberations are so impactful that Hamas spokesman Abu Ubaida even cited the Temple Movement importing red heifers for sacrifice as one of the motives for the militant group's attack on October 7th.Abu Ubaida included this declaration in a speech made marking the 100th day of the war in Gaza.

Despite the utterly apparent religious motives driving the direction of Israel's policy making, the Jewish state has somehow become immunized from comparable criticisms the western world places on Islamic states like Iran for being a radical theocracy.While Islamic nations are viewed in the west as inherently radical religious states, Israel is not labeled with that same distinction despite its foundation being predicated upon the idea that its god promised its people the land they occupy today which thus legitimizes their claim to it.If that cognitive dissonance is not corrected then the unconditional support the western world has for Israel may be the actual catalyst for the end of days. Although it may not fit the mold of the messianic prophecy of Judaism encompassing the sacrifice of the red heifer, the provocation of that apocalypse would mean the end of mankind all the same.

Debating that question and more at last night’s ZeroHedge debate were talk show hostDennis Pragerand Newsweek opinion editorBatya Ungar-Sargonvs. Young Turks founderCenk Uygurand libertarianDave Smith. The event was masterfully moderated by Saagar Enjeti, founder of Breaking Points.

Key themesincludedthe morality of Israel's invasionand the broader historical and political context that led to it,historical narratives- including grievances, perceptions of historical rights to land, and the impact of these narratives on current attitudes and policies, andfuture prospectsof potential solutions and the feasibility of peace in the region.

Summarizing the participants' general positions:

Dennis Prager: Argues that the root of the conflict is the non-acceptance of a Jewish state by Israel's neighbors. He emphasizes that if Israel disarmed, it would lead to genocide against Jews, drawing a parallel between the hostility Israel faces and historical antisemitism.

Cenk Uygur (The Young Turks): Criticizes the conduct of Israel in the conflict, pointing to the high number of Palestinian casualties and the broader humanitarian impact. He challenges the portrayal of Hamas and Palestinian resistance, comparing it to historical resistance movements against oppression.

Batya Ungar-Sargon: Focuses on whether Israel's actions since the invasion were just and suggests that while the devastation is immense, Israel's military actions are justified as self-defense against a terrorist group (Hamas) embedded within civilian areas.

Dave Smith: Discusses the complexities of the situation, suggesting that simplistic narratives about good vs. evil do not capture the realities of the conflict. He stresses that both Israelis and Palestinians include individuals who desire peace and those who pursue more extreme outcomes.

The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and we agree - it's worth a watch.

Thank you, It was an interesting, informative, and civil debate.

Everyone should watch this debate

For those who missed it last night,here are some highlights:

Were the Palestinians actually ""offered a state""?

Prager and Smith debated what transpired during the Camp David Accords of 2000 between Bill Clinton, Ehud Barak of Israel, and Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian Authority. The event is commonly used to depict the unwillingness of Palestinians to make necessary compromises for the right to establish their own state.

Israel has a ""superior"" culture to the Middle East?

Does Israel’s comparatively freer society and more prosperous society grant it moral authority over the war in Gaza? Prager pressed the issue to Smith and Uygur: “How’s this that none of you like to talk about? There are 2 million Palestinians in Israel.”

As the Iran debate heated up, Cenk Uygur said enough is enough when it comes to Middle Eastern wars, making the firm claim thathe will refuse to pay taxes if the U.S. “tries to send one of our guys into the Middle East” to “die for Netanyahu.”

Netanyahu covertly funded Hamas

Smith challenged Prager and Ungar-Sargon on Netanyahu’s covert campaign to fund Hamas for the purpose of undermining a Palestinian state.Both pro-Israel candidates acknowledged the veracity of such reports but claimed Netanyahu “didn’t know” it would lead to October 7.

Prager then went on to claim that Israel does not commit atrocities (outside of wartime). “That is a libel of Israel and it’s dishonest!” he said when Smith stated that both sides have affected “ungodly” atrocities.

2024-04-18 14:15:36,Study Points to Ketogenic Diet as Potential Alzheimer’s Treatment,https://web.archive.org/web/20240419124149/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-18/study-points-ketogenic-diet-potential-alzheimers-preventiontreatment,"Originally published viaArmageddon Prose:

In a bit of practical physiology that I never learned in public school but have since via the internet, when the body depletes its blood sugar, after it’s sucked whatever it can out of glycogen stores in the muscles, it turns to fatty acid-derived compounds called ketones, manufactured in the liver, that oxidize fat into usable forms of energy as an alternative to glucose.

“Ketone bodies are prominent fuel sources for all evolutionary domains of life.The body can use ketones as a source of energy in the absence of a carbohydrate source. Ketones make up 5% to 20% of the human body's total energy expenditure. The liver converts fatty acids into ketone bodies that travel to other organs via blood. This process is especially important when an individual's blood glucose has decreased, and they must maintain an energy source for organs such as the brain.”

When the body is fully turned over to ketones as the primary fuel source (which happens generally within 48 hours of near-zero carb intake), the new metabolic state is “ketosis.” Healthy ketosis is achieved through deprivation of carbohydrates in the diet, typically less than 50 grams of net carbs per day — an eating regimen called a “ketogenic diet.”

Recently published research in mice suggests a ketogenic diet may ameliorate the development of Alzheimer’s disease, possibly by elevating levels of a particular ketone body called beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB).

“We know that a host of factors play into Alzheimer's risk, including the makeup of our gut bacteria. So, it makes sense that our diets might have some influence.

A new study found a chemical elevated by 'ketogenic' diets – which are low in carbs and higher in proteins and fats – can delay the early stages of Alzheimer's-related memory loss in mice. That memory loss is comparable to the mild cognitive impairment seen in people before Alzheimer's takes hold.

Key to the new discovery by a team led by the University of California, Davis (UCD), isthe molecule beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which the ketogenic diet increases levels of. Here, the researchers found BHBwas particularly abundant in biological pathways associated with memory and brain plasticity.”

2024-04-18 19:05:40,The halving is upon us,https://web.archive.org/web/20240419124149/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-18/halving-only-few-hours-away,"If you find the post below informative,consider subscribing to our weekly newsletter.Each issue features the same type of in-depth analysis and thought-provoking content, ensuring you stay up-to-date on the latest developments in geopolitics, finance, and more.

Bitcoin's dollar exchange rate fell this week. The decline has beenattributed toinvestors selling off ""risk"" over the weekend due to geopolitical events and Jerome Powell announcing that rate cuts are unlikely to happen soon.

Most investors still consider bitcoin in the same category as tech stocks – or a ""risk on"" asset.

However, this characterization overlooks key fundamentals:

The global economy is entrenched in a defective fiat currency system.

Bitcoin is the most sophisticated form of money created, poised to supplant fiat money entirely, despite competition from gold, CBDCs, and other cryptocurrencies.

With a 21 million unit supply cap, an increase in bitcoin's use will increase its purchasing power, redistributing the value of all economic goods across a finite number of units.

Those who grasp this stand before an opportunity.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powellindicated thatconsistent firm inflation readings have dampened the likelihood of early rate cuts this year, with the central bank requiring more time to gain confidence that inflation is stabilizing. Powell's comments reflect a shift in the Fed's stance due to recent data suggesting prolonged inflationary pressures, thus potentially delaying any rate reductions and complicating efforts to achieve a smooth economic landing.

President Biden indicated that there would still be a rate cut this summer – which is still in play. Here’s a take from Dr. Jeff Ross on how things might play out:

The US Treasury continues trying to auction fresh bills, notes, and bonds at lower yields ""because inflation is trending lower.""The stealth (never publicly discussed) hope is to let inflation run a little hot while issuing lower yielding Treasurys... which will help inflate…

U.S. lawmakers have avoided setting clear policy for stablecoins, which are cryptographic tokens that are backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars. That might change this year – Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) recently penned anop-ed for Coindeskoutlining the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act of 2024.

Per their article, the Stablecoin Act aims to maintain state authority over non-depository trust companies, align federal and state banking charters, and establish a role for the Federal Reserve to foster a conducive environment for stablecoins.

Whether the act will gain support from critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren remains to be seen.

Despite the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, many large institutions have yet to allocate client funds meaningfully. While retail demand for bitcoin through ETFs has been robust, some financial advisors and larger institutional investors have been moving slowly.

BitGo CEO Mike Belshe summarized the sentiment ina recent interview:

Is it all going to go to BlackRock or to Fidelity, or heck, is Bitwise going to get some of this? Is it going to be really unstable? Is it going to get big really fast? That’s all starting to shake out now. People are now looking at it and saying, ‘Yeah, this is a pretty robust ecosystem, the largest, fastest-growing ETF sector in the history of the market.

Investors would do themselves a favor to understand bitcoin's benefits beyond its increasing purchasing power – especially those surrounding ownership ofphysical bitcoininstead of the paper claims sold by ETF issuers.

Amidst growing signs of stress in the economy overall, commercial real estate (CRE) is particularly troubling. The number of vacant office buildings continues to increase. This situation is compounded by the continued trend of companies relocating their offices to low-tax states.

Powell's decision to keep the federal funds rate unchanged will exacerbate this problem. In the coming quarters, firms will have no choice but to refinance their real estate loans at higher interest rates. Delinquencies will continue to affect regional banks – with manybuilding reservesin anticipation of CRE-related losses.

Despite a general downturn in venture capital, funding for bitcoin startups surged in 2023,with a 360% increase in pre-seed deals and a 69.2% rise in bitcoin venture deals.

Learn one key idea about bitcoin each week. This week:

Bitcoin changes the way we interact with money from an ownership perspective.

Unlike digital dollars, which offer holdersa claimto an underlying asset, or physical dollars that cannot be used for online transactions, bitcoin is a pure form of digital cash.

One way to think about bitcoin's ownership qualities is by viewing itas abearer asset.Takingself-custodyof bitcoin provides the private key holder access to the underlying asset at any time. Unlike dollars held in a bank account, money market fund, Venmo, or PayPal account, taking self-custody gives holders complete control over their bitcoin, like physical cash.

Owning your keys meansowning your coinsin a pure, literal way. Therefore, bitcoin is a bearer asset. However, what makes it special is that it is the firstdigitalbearer asset.

Physical bearer assets: A short history

Bearer assets are financial instruments that represent an obligation to pay the holder a fixed amount of another asset upon demand. Issuers create them through physical certificates, vouchers, or tickets. Ownership is transferred by physically giving the certificate to someone else. Historically, banknotes were bearer assets redeemable for a fixed amount of another asset, usually gold.

Is cash a bearer asset?

Fiat currencies are not bearer instruments. Physical cash has value based on the assumption that others will accept it for goods and services. Digital fiat currency is not a bearer instrument either. Digital dollars are held in regulated, third-party custody accounts and can only be spent through those third parties, introducing risk and uncertainty.

Banks have working hours, outside of which your deposit slip may not be exchanged for cash. Accounts can be frozen by accident or on purpose, with or without cause. Digital dollars require people who are the rightful owners of their money to be subject to institutions that many view as unreliable, untrustworthy, or corrupt.

What makes bitcoin different

Bitcoin is a unique digital asset that allows users to transact without relying on any financial institution. To move bitcoin, the owner needs a private key. This key represents digital asset ownership that can be transferred to a different address without requiring a third party.

Owning bitcoin means being able to move it, similar to a physical asset that represents ownership of a specific amount of gold or bonds.

Bitcoin: A bearer instrument for the digital future

Bitcoin is internet-native money that combines physical and digital features. Its open-source code base allows for continuous auditing and development of new custody solutions. Bitcoin's utility as a digital bearer instrument offers actual ownership, making it ideal for the modern age.

To understand the why peer-to-peer, permissionless exchange is fundamental to a free society, we recommend watching Natalie Smolenski’s keynote speech from last week’s Bitcoin Policy Summit:

2024-04-18 23:40:00,N.Y. Gives Trump The Anne Boleyn Treatment,https://web.archive.org/web/20240419124149/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/ny-gives-trump-anne-boleyn-treatment#comment-stream,"Authored by Richard Porter via RealClear Politics,

Jury selection isunderwaynow complete in the case ofThe People of the State of New York vs. Donald J. Trump,which alleges that the defendant lied to his own check register, and lied to the general ledger of his own company, when the invoice given to him by his lawyer was paid and recorded by someone else, and that the misstatement he made to himself in his own records was done “with the intent to defraud and intent to commit another crime and aid and conceal the commission thereof.”

It is often noted thatthis is the first time that a former U.S. president is being tried for a crime, although Ulysses S. Grant may (or may not) have been cited for speeding in his carriage.The federal government chose not to prosecute Bill Clinton, who lied under oath during a sexual harassment lawsuit and then dissembled again about sex before a grand jury. Clinton lost his law license, settled the case on unfavorable terms, and was sanctioned by both federal and Arkansas state courts.

So, this is a first. And let’s be honest about who is doing what to whom and why.

The prosecutor elected in New York County of New York state indicted Trump, after Trump announced his 2024 run for president, for allegedly violating New York Penal Laws 175.05 and 175.10 seven years ago.

That local prosecutor, Alvin Bragg, is a member of the Democratic Party– and the voters who elected Bragg and from whom the jury will be chosen support the Democratic Party. In 2016, the people of New York County voted 87% for Hillary Clinton and 10% for Donald Trump, and in 2020, 87% for Joe Biden and 12% for Donald Trump. In other words, the jury pool is chosen from one of the most partisan jurisdictions in the country – a place where almost all the judges are Democrats as well.

So the Democratic prosecutor elected in the second most Democratic county in the United States will try the former Republican president and current putative Republican Party presidential nominee before a Democrat-appointed judge and a jury drawn from a pool 87% of whom voted against him (and who are being asked if they watch Fox News or listen to talk radio in the screening process).

One wonders if the law even matters. But let’s review the two statutes at issue to highlight what the law requires the prosecution to prove. First, the prosecutor must prove that Trump violated the relevant statute, which requires a finding that he falsified business records with intent to defraud – that he “makes or causes a false entry in the business records of an enterprise.”

By the way, falsifying business records in the second degree is a misdemeanor, not a felony. Moreover, New York’s statute of limitations requires that misdemeanor prosecutions be commenced within two years of the commission of the act, meaning that under the last provision, this case should never have been filed.

Bragg elevated this misdemeanor into a felony by including New York  Penal Law 175.10 in the indictment –falsifying business records in the first degree. That statute reads this way:

“A person is guilty of falsifying business records in the first degree when he commits the crime of falsifying business records in the second degree, and when his intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof.”

There are other obvious difficulties with this case beyond the credibility of the witnesses (a porn star who denied any affair numerous times and a disbarred lawyer convicted of perjury).

For example, why does the entry in the check register or the general ledger matter at all? When would those entries, as opposed to the allegedly false invoices, be shown to anyone for any nefarious purpose? And were the entries even false? Was there any intent to fool someone to obtain something in making the entries – who was the target of the allegedly false entry in private books and records? If there’s no mark, no victim, then how could there be an “intent to defraud”? Defraud whom? And what is the other crime that the person making the book entry intended to commit or hide? If the other crime is not a New York crime but a federal crime, does every county prosecutor in the United States, including Alvin Bragg, have the jurisdiction to enforce an alleged federal crime indirectly through a state crime?

The political nature of this trial is obvious, and unprecedented in the United States. Even with irrefutable DNA evidence that Bill Clinton committed perjury, the special prosecutor declined to press criminal charges against him. In America’s recent past, prosecutors tended to exhibit a modicum of restraint. Those days are apparently gone.

I reviewed an interesting law review article ofpolitical show trialsdown through history, from the trial of Socrates in Athens to the famous show trials in the 1930s Stalinist Soviet Union, curious to see if I could find historical precedent for this trial.

The closest precedent is probably Anne Boleyn’s trial for adultery in 1536. It was about sex, the trial was in a hostile jurisdiction controlled by her accuser, and the whole point of the exercise was to lop off the head of someone who stood in the way of the regime’s continuity. But that’s what Democrats have lusted for since Donald Trump first arrived on the scene, isn’t it?They made no secret of it.

2024-04-19 02:00:00,BRICS - The Project Of The Century,https://web.archive.org/web/20240419124149/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/brics-project-century#comment-stream,"Authored by Peter Hanseler via VoiceOfRussia.com,

The Western media are prioritizing the Ukraine conflict, the green revolution and the woke revolution. In the shadow of this media coverage, BRICS is changing the world.

We bring you the latest figures and place them in the current geopolitical environment. – An analysis.

One of the main topics of this blog is BRICS. We have written numerous articles, followed and analyzed the development of this organization. Significantly, the first independent post on this blog was dedicated to BRICS on November 18, 2022 “The unstoppable rise of the East“.

Our last dedicated BRICS-only article from 24 September 2023 “BRICS will change the world – slowly” gave an overview of the development and summarized the results of the BRICS summit in South Africa in August 2023. This article was published by ZeroHedge, the GloomBoomDoom report by Dr. Marc Faber and Weltwoche (print and online).

From the density of our coverage, it is clear that we ascribe paramount importance to BRICS for the geopolitical and geo-economic development of the world. Based on the facts, we have come to the conclusion that BRICS will change the world more than all other developments of the last 100 years put together. The developments around BRICS have already triggered a tectonic shift in the geopolitical balance of power; the Ukraine conflict and the accelerating crisis in the Middle East are merely pieces of the mosaic by comparison.

The Western media are setting their priorities differently and focusing on topics that we believe are of lesser importance: Mortal enemy Russia, wokeness and green ideology.

Reporting on BRICS in the West, if it takes place at all, is limited to portraying BRICS either as an instrument of China to achieve world power – as the Financial Times put it,

«How the BRICS nations risk becoming satellites of China»

or to trivialize the success of BRICS – according to the NZZ,

“We explain in the video why this extension only promises limited success.”

We proceed as we always do and develop a fact-based foundation for a discussion.

Since January 1, Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Ethiopia have joined the existing members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) as new members.

In August 2023, Argentina was invited to become the sixth member. However, the new president of Argentina, Javier Milei, decided not to accept this invitation and to rely on the USA and Donald Trump to rescue his economy.

It is impossible to judge at this point whether this decision will prove to be the right one. For the second largest country in South America, which was once one of the richest countries in the world, it is to be hoped that Milei can pull the cart out of the deep mire. Milei is fighting against the establishment in Argentina, which has driven the country economically to the wall. These former rulers are serious opponents who are fighting for sinecures that Milei must wrest from them if he wants to save Argentina. We hope that Javier Milei can prevail and wish him every success and good luck. The first signs of success appear to be emerging: The country was able to report a positive budget for the first time last month. It seems to be heading in the right direction.

According to Western media reports, Saudi Arabia is not yet fully on board. South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor is reported to have told Reuters that “Saudi Arabia has not yet responded to the invitation to join BRICS. It is still being considered”.

Saudi Arabia, or rather the ruling Saud family, has been an ally of the USA since the end of the Second World War, and this relationship has been further strengthened since the agreement of the ”Petrodollar” in 1974.

Since President Biden has been in power, the relationship with the USA has suffered massively, while at the same time cooperation with China and Russia has strengthened to an unprecedented level.

The problem that Saudi Arabia now has is the gigantic investments that the state and private individuals have made, particularly in the USA and the UK. Government investments in the USA alone amount to overUSD 35 billionand investments in the UK are said to be aroundUSD 75 billion. Due to the geopolitical situation in the world and the West’s aggressive sanctions policy, the concerns of Saudi Arabia that these investments could be confiscated in the event of a BRICS accession are definitely justified. As Saudi Arabia is important to BRICS and China has overtaken the US as Saudi Arabia’s largest trading partner, we expect Saudi Arabia to join BRICS as soon as China might make commitments to the Saudis in the event of Western expropriation.

Dark green BRICS until August 2023 – light green – the new BRICS members – Source: VoicefromRussia

In our figures, we compare the BRICS-10 with the G7 and the world as a whole to give you a feel for the ratios. The parameters we use are population, GDP (adjusted for purchasing power), oil production, gas production and gold production.

We show the gross national product adjusted for purchasing power. If you use the US dollar as a measure of GDP, the economic power of a country is distorted: if you want to measure financial strength realistically, it makes a big difference whether, for example, a Big Mac in US dollars costs twice as much in one place as elsewhere. The so-calledBig Mac Indexis reason enough to use purchasing power-adjusted figures when comparing GDP figures. The reason why Western media use the unadjusted figures is pure marketing to disguise the devaluation of the US dollar and make it appear stronger than it is.

Graphical representation of the figures – Source: VoicefromRussia.

All factors show that the BRICS 10 far outstrip the G7 and it seems incomprehensible that the West is simply suppressing this fact. A look beneath the surface reveals facts that reinforce the impression of the bare figures.

The following additional facts should be taken into consideration when evaluating the oil production figures:

Firstly, although the USA is still the largest oil producer in the world, accounting for around 18% of global production, it also consumes the most oil, with a share of over 20%. This means that the USA is currently not even able to cover its own consumption. This fact alone is a compelling reason for the US to pressure Saudi Arabia not to join BRICS.

Secondly, the major oil-producing members of BRICS have a great deal of influence or even control over OPEC. As BRICS thus also controls OPEC and therefore controls the price and distribution of a large proportion of oil, BRICS can be said to have an (indirect) monopoly position.

Thirdly, the production costs for US oil are around 2.5 times higher than the production costs for Saudi oil.

These factors therefore further strengthen the BRICS’ position of power with regard to oil.

With regard to natural gas, it should be noted that with Iran’s accession to BRICS, the two largest natural gas producers in the world are joint members of BRICS: Russia and Iran.

The largest non-BRICS gas producer is Qatar, which is (still) allied with the USA. BRICS is therefore also a real center of power when it comes to natural gas.

With regard to gold, it should be briefly mentioned that China and Russia are number 1 and 2 in global gold production respectively. I mention gold here because there is a good chance that gold will again play an important role in future monetary systems at some point – more on this below.

Over 220 BRICS conferences will be held in Russia over the course of 2024. The topics are diverse: science, high technology, healthcare, environmental protection, culture, sport, youth exchange and civil society.

President Putin’s statements at the beginning of the year at the opening event of BRICS 2024 in Moscow were interesting. He mentioned several times the closer cooperation between the members on security issues. It seems that BRICS will therefore not only focus on economic aspects, but also on security-related aspects more and more. The apparent coordination of the BRICS states in connection with the Middle East conflict at the UN in New York clearly indicates close cooperation on non-economic issues.

Various non-official sources have reported that the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organization) is moving closer to BRICS and may even merge with it. In addition to China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, Iran has also been a member of the SCO since July 2023.

This is extremely important due to the heightened geopolitical tensions and the two major conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. If these two organizations were to merge, there would be a new counterweight to NATO. NATO is already increasingly being characterized by experts as a mere chattering club, particularly due to its performance in the Ukraine conflict, which was not a success. As a result, NATO has almost lost its threatening potential. If the BRICS-SCO merger becomes a reality, NATO would finally degenerate into an empty shell.

Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Kuwait, Nigeria, Pakistan, Palestine, Senegal, Thailand, Venezuela, Vietnam and Belarus have formally applied for membership.

Green: BRICS 10 (light green Saudi Arabia) – Yellow: formal membership applications

It should be noted in this list that the formal applicants will probably not all be admitted in 2024. This illustration shows the maximum and the broad formal interest in this organization. The applications for admission from some countries harbor great potential for conflict with the USA.

In my opinion, the greatest potential for conflict from an American perspective is the possible accession of Mexico, Cuba and Venezuela. Mexico’s membership would be seen by the USA in the same way as the Soviet stationing of nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962 – “enemy on the doorstep of the USA”. This is probably also the reason why it was reported onMarch 3that Mexico had not submitted a formal application for membership. Fear is breathing down the necks of the Mexicans and the USA is exerting pressure in the background.

In Venezuela, the country with the world’s largest oil reserves, the US has been trying for years to overthrow President Maduro and install apuppet.Last August, it wasnot enough to gain admissionand the USA will do everything in its power to prevent this oil giant from joining. However, the USA has a losing hand with the Venezuelan population, as it is imposing sanctions on the beleaguered country to bring about a collapse and accepting that the Venezuelan people are suffering fromhunger.

The list of formal applications for admission could therefore change considerably between now and October, when the decisions on who will be invited to Kazan are made. What is certain, however, is that the G7 – especially the United States – is devoting huge energies to slowing down the development of BRICS. In my opinion, however, this organization is already too powerful to be weakened by the West.

The greatest danger of this ever stronger community is to the USA. We have discussed many times that the Petrodollar is the real foundation of American supremacy and not the American armed forces.

It is of existential importance for the USA that international trade, especially commodity trade, is conducted in US dollars. We explain why.

The US dollar as a global trading currency means that practically all countries have to hold US dollars in reserve in order to be able to settle their trade invoices. This makes the US dollar a reserve currency.

However, central banks do not hold the US dollar in cash, but in US government securities in order to earn interest. This makes the world’s central banks the biggest buyers of US government securities, regardless of whether they think they are a good investment. As a result, the US can refinance its debt on terms that are not based on the strength of the US economy, but on these systemic purchases. French President Giscard d’Estaing rightly described the petrodollar in the 1970s as an “exorbitant privilege”, as it leads to the automatic refinancing of the USA.

However, the USA has been abusing this privilege for decades. Whenever a country implements something that the US does not like, it is cut off from the US dollar. The US can implement this without any problems, as all US dollar transactions go through the US. The consequences for the country concerned are catastrophic, as it is effectively banned from the commodities trade.

However, by blocking the foreign currency reserves of the Russian central bank in March 2023, the US has overstepped the mark, because now the entire Global South is afraid to hold US dollars, as they may suffer the same fate. Although every legal expert declares that the freeze was already carried out without an international legal basis, the West is about to go one step further and prepare the confiscation. This is the unequivocal statement made by Janet Yellen on February 27:

“I also believe it is necessary and urgent for our coalition to find a way to unlock the value of these immobilized assets to support Ukraine’s continued resistance and long-term reconstruction.”

The EU under Ms. von der Leyen and even exponents in Switzerland are preparing to put this planned raid into practice and thus not only continue to block these funds, but to steal them."

A Congolese migrant who had his deportation from the U.K. blocked by an airline’s cabin crew and previously campaigned outside a detention center with a sign that read, “Migrants are not criminals,” has pleaded guilty to raping a 15-year-old girl.

Anicet Mayela entered his guilty plea at Oxford Crown Court last Friday for one count of rape of a former economics student.

The court heard how there was a high level of “dangerousness” surrounding the attack,which is understood to have taken place between Dec. 1 and Dec. 31 last year.

The Congolese national had been living in Britain since 2004 when he paid smugglers to help him escape his country of origin where he claimed he was being persecuted.

Several attempts by the U.K. Home Office to deport him were thwarted by feigned injuries and legal challenges,including an incident back in May 2005 when a planned deportation flight was prevented from taking off by Air France cabin crew who claimed public officials had broken Mayela’s hand after handcuffing him.

With theaid of left-wing charities, including the Institute of Race Relations, and immigration lawyers,the Congolese national won leave to remain in Britain later that year after successfully arguing a return to his homeland would be a violation of his human rights.

Mayela used the opportunity to actively campaign against the deportation of illegal migrants, participating in a demonstration near his detention center in Oxford where he spoke to the BBC andhung a sign around his neck that read, “Migrants are not criminals.”

“I am here to support my friends. I have been inside here, and at Colnbrook,”he told the U.K.’s public broadcaster from outside the detention center.

On Friday, Mayela was ordered to remain in custody while a pre-sentencing report was prepared.

He is scheduled to return for sentencing on May 10.

2024-04-19 03:30:00,Borrell Came Up With A Nifty Excuse For Why NATO Won't Shoot Down Russian Missiles Over Ukraine,https://web.archive.org/web/20240419124149/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/borrell-came-nifty-excuse-why-nato-wont-shoot-down-russian-missiles-over-ukraine,"Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

This is credible enough of a reason to justify a conventional NATO intervention in defense of Israel without giving Ukraine grounds to claim that there are double standards at play.

Ukraine became jealous like never before after NATO members helpedshoot down Iranian missiles en route to Israelearlier this month yet won’t lift a finger to help Ukraine shoot down Russian ones.

British Foreign Secretary David Cameronsaidthat “the difficulty with what you suggest (about the UK shooting down Russian missiles) is if you want to avoid an escalation in terms of a wider European war, I think the one thing you do need to avoid is NATO troops directly engaging Russian troops.”

Pentagon spokesman John Kirbyresponded to a similar questionby saying“Look: different conflicts, different airspace, different threat picture. And [President Joe Biden] has been clear from the beginning [of the Ukraine hostilities] that the US is not going to be involved in that conflict in a combat role.”Zelensky’s Chief of Staff Andrey Yermak didn’t buy their explanations, however, anddemandedthat the West start shooting down Russian missiles just like they shot down Iranian ones.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg tried allaying Ukraine’s jealousy bydeclaringthat“if allies face a choice between meeting NATO capability targets and providing more aid to Ukraine, my message is clear: send more to Ukraine.”

Even though he’s telling members to prioritize Ukraine’s interests over their own national ones, Kiev isn’t expected to calm down since it still knows that NATO won’t come to its rescue in this respect like the bloc just did for Israel.

That’s where EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell’s nifty excuse comes in.As he explained,“Iran’s attacks flew over air bases of the armies of France, the US, the UK and Jordan. They have gone over their bases, which then acted in self-defense. There are no air bases of the UK, or the US, much less Jordan of course, on Ukrainian territory or in the territory Russian missiles fly over. Therefore, the same answer cannot be given because the circumstances are not the same.”

This is credible enough of a reason to justify a conventional NATO intervention in defense of Israel without giving Ukraine grounds to claim that there are double standards at play.

The only way that Kiev could try flipping the tables is in the far-fetched event that it officially admits the presence of NATO troops on its territory,which Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski described as an “open secret” last month, and pinpoints their bases to prove that the bloc does nothing as Russian missiles fly overhead.

That is extremely unlikely to happen, however, since it would represent a major security risk.Ukrainian officials might still hint that this is the case and perhaps leak vague information about it into their national media and/or to international media via their “agents of influence”, but they’re almost certainly not going to cross the red line of disclosing specific details that could put those troops at risk.Borrell, for all hisprofessionalfaults, knows this and thus crafted his nifty excuse that inspired this analysis.

Giving credit where it’s due, that was a wise move since his explanation is consistent enough to dispel Ukraine’s complaints about NATO’s double standards and consequent perception of being less important to the bloc than Israel is, both of which are true but can now be more plausibly denied.Ukraine should accept that NATO isn’t going to treat it and Israel as equals, with the only consolation being if some members send it more Patriot systems, but that’s not the same as them shooting down Russian missiles.

2024-04-19 04:15:00,Swiss Watch Exports Crash In China & Hong Kong,https://web.archive.org/web/20240419124149/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/swiss-watch-exports-crash-china-hong-kong#comment-stream,"Fears of a luxury slowdown are materializing. New data from theFederation of the Swiss Watch Industryshows that exports of luxury timepieces tumbled the most since 2020 as demand crashed in Asia.

Swiss watch exports dropped in March. Their value fell by 16.1% compared with the same month in 2023 to 2 billion Swiss francs ($2.2 billion). Cratering demand in China and Hong Kong caused most of the decline. Weakness was reported across all six main markets.

Exports to mainland China, the second-biggest market for Swiss watches, plunged 42%, the worst decline since March 2020, when the global economy began seizing up due to government-enforced lockdowns. Shipments to Hong Kong tumbled even more, down 44%.

""The negative trend is even worse than we expected and the decline in China is really worrying and probably indicates that inventories in the region were once again too high,""Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Vontobel in Switzerland, toldBloomberg.

Faltering demand for Swiss watches comes one day after LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury group, controlled by the family of billionaire Bernard Arnault,reported that ""uncertain geopolitical and economic environment"" has weighed on luxury spending.

LVMH shares in Paris are 10.5% below the peak put in early last year.

For a broader view of global luxury stocks, theMSCI World Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods Indexalso shows the index well below (-21%) the peak put in at the end of 2021.

A combination of China's slower-than-expected economic recovery and generational highs in interest rates across the Western world are some of the reasons why a global slowdown in the luxury market has materialized.

Israel - having once again ignored Biden's pleadings not to escalate the already tense situation - is retaliating against Iran's weekend strike, which was itself a retaliation against Israel bombing Iran's embassy in Syria on April 1.

Moments ago futures dumped, oil prices spiked, and treasury yields slumped amid social media reports and Reuters headlines that there have beenthree ""huge explosions"" near the central Iran cities of Natanz(location of an Iranian nuclear power plant)and Isfahan(location of the Iranian Nuclear Technology Center which is suspected of being the center of Iran's nuclear weapons program), as well as simultaneous explosions in Iraq and Syria, where the Israel air force appears to be targeting pro-Iranian militias.

IRANIAN MEDIA CONFIRMS AN ISRAELI ATTACK ON IRANIAN TERRITORY

IRANIAN STATE MEDIA IS REPORTING THAT TONIGHT’S AIRSTRIKE BY THE ISRAEL AIR FORCE MAY HAVE TARGETED THE 8TH TACTICAL AIRBASE OF THE IRANIAN AIR FORCE, WITHIN ISFAHAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, WHICH CONTAINS MULTIPLE SQUADRONS OF F-14 “TOMCAT” FIGHTER AIRCRAFT.

UNCONFIRMED: Iraqi sources report that airstrikes in the capital city of Baghdad have targeted a building where a high-level meeting was being held with the presence of several groups supported by Iran and members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

The market reaction has been immediate, with S&P futures dumping initially but then, as speculation grows that this is another measured, scripted response to the measured, scripted initial attack by Iran, the market is starting to normalize fast.

... with oil initially surging, then dropping.

... and gold also first surged above $2400, only to slide right back...

... with Silver fading all the gains...

...and Treasuries are aggressively bid but they too are now fading.

Even as the Bitcoin algos reprice WW3... for the second time in 5 days.

And as traders brace for the worst, because even if Israel hopes to present a ""measured"" retaliation now it's a question of what Iran will do next, it once again appears that this was just the latest episode in the carefully scripted middle-eastern ""war"" soap opera.

More as we get it, until then, fear not:he is watching everything... closely.

Europe’s new car sales fell in March for the first time this year, dragged down by a decline in electric vehicle (EV) registrations and the timing of the Easter holidays, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, ACEA, said on Thursday.

All new car sales in the European Union car market dropped by 5.2% year-on-year to 1 million units in March,while passenger vehicle sales in Europe including non-EU members such as the UK and Norway fell by 2.8%,ACEA’s datashowed.

In the EU, new electric vehicle sales slumped by 11.3% to 134,397 units in March, led by a major 29% decline in EV sales in the biggest European market, Germany.

Car sales in Norway, where most new vehicle registrations are EVs, plunged from over 19,000 cars in March 2023 to 9,750 units last month.

As EV sales fell in the EU, their market share shrank from 13.9% in March 2023 to 13% in the same month of 2024.

Among the three largest BEV markets, Belgium (+23.8%) and France (+10.9%) enjoyed double-digit increases, while Germany faced a significant decrease of 28.9%, ACEA said.

The EU saw a total of 332,999 new battery-electric cars registered during the first quarter of 2024, up by 3.8% compared to the same quarter last year.

Despite the general market decline, hybrid-electric car registrations in the EU jumped by 12.6% in March 2024, with France and Italy driving the increase. The share of hybrid car sales rose to 29% of the new sales last month, up from 24.4% in March 2023.

The slowdown in EV sales in recent months has not been limited to Europe.

Tesla, for example, saw its deliveriesslump in the first quarterfor the first annual drop since the start of the pandemic in 2020, missing analyst forecasts by a mile in a sign that even price cuts haven’t been able to stave off an increasingly heated competition on the EV market.

2024-04-19 05:45:00,"Albanian ""King Of Instagram"" Used Platform To Tell Followers How To Sneak Into Britain, Join The Drug Trade",https://web.archive.org/web/20240419124149/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/albanian-king-instagram-used-platform-tell-followers-how-sneak-britain-join-drug-trade,"While we're sure social media sites are busy moderating ""misinformation"" once again ahead of the all-important 2024 election, one influencer is using Instagram to give his followers tips on sneaking into Britain and making £6,000 a month working illegally in the drug trade.

'You know there are a lot of brothers and sisters in hardship. Can you show how to go there unnoticed, without being detected? How do they do it?' he says in one of his video clips.

Kozak Braci, an Albanian social media influencer with over 500,000 followers on TikTok and Instagram, has hosted live tours of cannabis farms and offered insights into profiting from criminal activities in the UK during his streams, according to anew profile from the Daily Mail.

The Daily Mailreportedthat one image captures Braci standing beside a man in a black SUV, with a house displaying the Union flag in the background. In another photo, the influencer, whose chest and right arm are adorned with tattoos of AK-47s, sports a Chelsea shirt in front of a red Audi.

Braci, who boasts that he earns £25,000 a month from his social media platforms, frequently posts pictures of himself with luxury cars and designer items.

""It's great to stay in the cannabis house. I can live there without a problem,"" he tells his followers.

Graham Wettone, an ex-Met Police officer, reacted to the videos shown to him by characterizing them as glorifying drug production in the UK and enticing would-be criminals to come to Britain.

Earlier this year, it was revealed that the Home Office intends to pay Albanian influencers £100,000 to discourage their followers from entering Britain illegally. This modern twist on the public information film aims to reach groups susceptible to traffickers' falsehoods. The initiative, devised by Cass Horowitz of 'Brand Rishi' fame, has been criticized by activists as ineffective 'toy town tinkering.'

A United Nations report indicates that Albanian criminals now dominate the UK's cocaine market, importing the drug via south-east England's ports with the aid of violent European gangs. Among these, the Hellbanianz gang from East London openly flaunts its criminal endeavors on social media.

Additionally, in the first four months of the year, 80 Albanian migrants were collectively sentenced to 130 years in prison.

Tik Tok commented: ""TikTok works closely with UK law enforcement, the National Crime Agency and organisations such as STOP THE TRAFFIK to fight this industry-wide issue, and our steadfast efforts helped reduce the number of small boat crossings last year, according to Border Officials. We continue to strictly maintain a zero tolerance approach to human exploitation and proactively find over 95% of content we remove for breaking these rules.""

Meta responded: ""We have removed the violating content brought to our attention. Buying, selling or soliciting drugs is not allowed on our platforms; our teams use a mix of technology and human review to remove this content as quickly as possible, and we work with the police and youth organisations to get better at detection.""

2024-04-19 06:55:00,23andMe Saved From Collapse After CEO Floats Private Takeover,https://web.archive.org/web/20240419124149/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/23andme-saved-collapse-after-ceo-floats-private-takeover,"DNA-testing company 23andMe soared in the early cash session in New York on news that Anne Wojcicki, the CEO, plans to take the struggling company private after three years on the public markets. The company once sported a $6 billion valuation and has since collapsed to $235 million.

Wojcicki's bigannouncementwas made in a public filing late Wednesday. The filing stated that she ""is considering making a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of 23andMe.""

The filing noted that she would reject any other buyer taking over the company. Her ownership stake is around 20% of the total outstanding shares. This means she controls 49.99% of the company's voting power, making it impossible for anyone to purchase the human genetics and biopharmaceutical company.

Around 1030 ET, shares of 23andMe jumped 48% to 53 cents a share. On Wednesday, they were at a record low of $0.36.

Bloomberg data shows 32 million shares, or 10.77% of the float, is short. This leaves room for squeezes.

In 2021, 23andMe went public through a special-purpose acquisition company sponsored by Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. At the time, the company's value jumped to $5.8 billion. By 2022, the valuation plunged to as low as $1 billion.

""As sales of its DNA testing kits have slowed in recent years, 23andMe has pivoted to offering subscription products in hopes of creating repeat customers for its consumer business,"" Bloomberg pointed out.

There were fears earlier this year that 23andMe would be sold to an overseas PE firm. Thankfully, this has not happened because it would be anational security risk.

2024-04-19 07:20:00,Hard Money Heat Check,https://web.archive.org/web/20240419124149/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/hard-money-heat-check,"Submitted byQTR's Fringe Finance

There are few things I like more about NBA basketball than when a player gets so hot that it seems as though they can't miss a shot, no matter where they are shooting from. The legendary video gameNBA Jamcaptured this beautifully, for those that remember.

A “heat check” is when a hot player takes what would normally be a shot that's borderline absurd because they are feeling so good and confident in their ability that they feel like they can “push it” a little. The difficult shot is supposed to be the determining factor as to whether or not the player is still ""hot"".

The point is that I'm having the same kind of “heat check” feeling about precious metals and hard money this week — let me explain why.

First off, the movement in gold has been absolutely outstanding — even Goldman Sachs raised their forecast to $2700/oz. this week. But still, the action in the precious metal has really only gotten limited coverage in the news media so far.

And if it isn't obvious by now, gold miner stocks are still extremely unloved. As Imentioned in my portfolio review of my 24 stocks I like for this yeardays ago, sentiment around miners remains horrific. Gold and the GLD is continually piercing through all-time highs, and miners and GDX are nowhere near all-time highs, let alone 52-week highs.

As the divergence between the gold spot price and miners continues to widen, it feels as though it is getting more and more blindingly obvious that miners remain one of the best places for value in the entire market.

Miners continue to be my top conviction pick, and I still think there is tons of runway. While gold spot prices have gotten a few mentions in financial media, the precious metal miners have gotten very few, if any. Thesellsignal I'll be looking for will be the days when the GDX performance has been so good that CNBC can do nothing but talk about miners. This is obviously avery, very, verylong way off.

The purpose of this article—the reason why it is a “heat check” for gold and sound money assets—is because even though I've never been more bullish on gold, it’s important to understand thatif the broader market crashes, gold will sell off with everything else. If the broader market starts to sell off for any reason—political conflict, overvaluation, election results—everything that isn't bolted down is going to be sold as people scramble for liquidity in a 5.5% interest rate environment. Gold, silver, bitcoin, and all commodities will likely be part and parcel with such a sell-off.

For example, on Monday when the market puked midday, it took gold with it. This is the same type of selling that would occur during a crash. The encouraging thing is that it didn't take but an hour or two for investors to realize that the sell-off was nonsensical, as the reason for the crash—escalating tensions in the Middle East—was actually bullish for gold. So, you can see the GLD diverge from the Nasdaq (QQQ) and finish the day positive despite falling with the indices midday.

This move is a microcosm of what I expect to happen when the broader market crashes at some point in the relatively near future as a result of high interest rates and a stretched consumer during an economic contraction: a crash with markets, followed by a recovery as the market remains decimated.

It's not even that the crash that will occur in metals will matter, seeing as how $2000 is likely now going to act as significant support for gold, and that's a price that is still 10 or 20% higher than most miners have modeled for the next couple of years. It's more about just keeping our heads screwed on straight right now, as there appears to be a lot of developments worthy of mixed feelings.

As a gold investor, I said at the beginning of the year that I liked it not only because it was a commodity but also because it was a fiscal dominance/inflation hedge and a geopolitical hedge. All of the situations I raised at the beginning of the year now seem to be playing out at the same time, which frankly makes me feel a little conflicted. I don't want the US to be in an inflation crisis, nor do I want World War III to break out. However, as I said at the beginning of the year, it just seemed that these would be the most likely situations investors would be responding to this year, unfortunately. That said, it really doesn't make crowing about how right we have been about gold for the last decade enjoyable.

I'm cautiously optimistic about the way things are going, but just remember that it's calledvolatilitybecause it can shock the market with unexpected outcomes. I personally plan to have cash on the sidelines and plenty of breathing room to be able to navigate whatever choppy waters may be ahead, even as gold rips.

Also on Monday, I sacrificed a couple of brain cells to let Charles Payne onto my TV since he was hosting Natalie Brunell and Peter Schiff debate bitcoin versus gold.

I've been pretty clear that my bitcoin allocation is far less than that of my gold position. I still think the precious metals are top dog when it comes to money. And even I get sick of listening to Peter Schiff crow about gold every time bitcoin is up and gold is down, but he did make some very good points during his appearance.

He noted that relative to one another—if you want to compare them both as types of assets—that bitcoin priced in gold has still not hit new all-time highs:

""Well, you know, gold's probably going to close at a new record high today. It's only a few dollars off now, above $2370. Gold is rising because the dollar, the Euro, and the Yen—fiat currencies—are losing value. Inflation is real, it's here to stay, it's not going anywhere near the Fed's 2% target. We're headed in the wrong direction. We'll probably be in double digits by next year, and eventually, the first digit isn't going to be a one.

Central banks are out in front of this; they're the main buyers. You know, a lot of Americans have been foolishly selling their gold to buy these Bitcoin ETFs. There's nothing elegant about losing your money in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not going up; in fact, Bitcoin peaked two and a half years ago at about 37 oz. of gold. As we speak now, it's worth less than 27 oz. That's a 27% decline in 2 and a half years. This is a bear market.""

On the other hand, Peter was using price to make his case:

""There's nothing sound about Bitcoin. It's losing the race right now. Take a look at your screen. Gold is up $25, $26, and Bitcoin is getting clobbered.”

Using price to make your case is something that when bitcoiners do it, Schiff is quick to remind them that “price is what you pay and value is what you get”. Personally, the price action for me is not an indicator of the fundamentals. On the contrary, the fundamentals are a driver of the price action. Companies don't perform betterbecausetheir price goes up, for the most part. Usually, companies performed better andthentheir price goes up.

Natalie also made some points that I didn't particularly agree with, specifically when she claimed that bitcoiners don’t feel the need to attack gold:

“Oh, I know Peter, and you know what? Bitcoiners don't feel the need to constantly attack gold because we're not threatened by gold.”

This (bitcoiners attacking gold) is so prominent it was going to be the topic of an entire article for me this week, but I'm writing this article instead.

Natalie is dead wrong. Bitcoinersabsolutely cannot stop infringing on otherwise happy gold and silver investorsbyconstantlytelling them they don't own enough bitcoin or that their allocation is too small. I see it every day that I tweet about gold — people respond to me and ask me why I waste my time with it, people are constantly telling me that I need more bitcoin or and bitcoiners are generally not staying out of the business of people who choose to own gold, either by itself or alongside bitcoin.

This is extremely toxic behavior. In my decade of working with short sellers and dealing with scams, a pump like this — where people go out of their way to unprovokedly tell you that you need to own something — always seems to be a common denominator. It just isn't a good look for bitcoin and it'swhy I wrote the article""Let Bitcoin Cook"". In it, I made the argument that the community would be better served by simply shutting the f*** up and letting the asset do the talking.

For example, I'm a gold investor, but I don't tell people that are bitcoin-only that theyneedto own gold. Instead, I just mind my own business. Bitcoiners seem incapable of this. Natalie also gets it wrong when she says that gold “didn’t work” — yet it is the main reserve asset of many Central Banks, which is a dream scenario for bitcoiners (becoming a Central Bank reserve asset). During the interview, Natalie claims:

“I think the American dream has really been hijacked.We tried gold; it didn't work.It was papered over. That system has failed the American people, and Bitcoin does provide hope for us, the working class. We want to be able to work for something that has to be measured by a free market so that we can see real value emerge, as opposed to being captured by politics and bureaucracy, which ultimately is a system that benefits the few at the expense of everyone else…”

All this did was remind me of Celsius's Alex Minsky—now with his company bankrupt and dealing with criminal liability for running a crypto scheme—who said nearly the same nonsensical argument about gold, claiming in a debate with Peter Schiff that gold had ""zero value"".

Bitcoin and gold have different properties—each with their own positives and negatives—but anybody telling you that gold has zero value or has failed is either catastrophically misinformed or simply not arguing in good faith, in my opinion.

And so, we forge forward another day, where owning whatever sound money assets we want to own—gold, silver, commodities, housing, etc.—still remains the obvious choice. Tensions in the Middle East are still simmering, and the United States still has the urgency of fiscal dominance. By virtue of those two things alone, pretty much anything that has a fixed supply is going to wind up going up in price, in my opinion. If I had to deliver general advice in one saying it would be “take it easy…but take it”.

What I mean by that is embrace the fact that from an investment perspective, things appear to be moving as we planned, but don’t get cocky or arrogant, and to remember that in a broader market sell-off, nearly everything can drop in value. However, as the only tool in the Fed's toolbox remains printing money—which I believe they will do no matter how bad inflation is if the market crashes—any such crash in sound money would likely be short.

For today, the world hasn’t ended and the US is not experiencing hyperinflation. Treasury auctionshaven't failedand the market is still living to fight for one more day. So, onward and upward — take it easy, but take it.

Signal and Telegram—two foreign messaging apps—were also removed from the Chinese App Store. The removal of the four apps comes as elites in Washington, DC, attempt to ban Chinese app TikTok from US phones.

""We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree. The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,"" Apple said in a statement, as quoted byBloomberg.

Apple continued, ""These apps remain available for download on all other storefronts where they appear.""

These four messaging apps allow users to bypass China's Great Firewall through virtual private networks. Beijing finds this troubling as citizens could be subjected to disinformation and misinformation content (created by foreign adversaries) that sparks social unrest or discontent with the communist regime.

Bloomberg said the orders to nuke the four apps follow a prior ""cleanup program Chinese regulators initiated in 2023 that was expected to remove many defunct or unregistered apps from domestic iOS and Android stores, including local ones. In August, China asked all mobile app developers to register with the government by the end of March, or cease operating.""

Rich Bishop, co-founder and chief executive officer of AppInChina, expressed concern that Chinese consumers will now be limited to domestic apps, with only a handful of international ones. He warned that this move by Beijing could further isolate Chinese citizens from the rest of the world.

The removals come at a time when Apple is navigating a delicate balance between complying with China's censorship-industrial complex and maintaining iPhone market share in the world's largest handset market.

Last year, Apple was China's top smartphone maker, commanding over 17% of the market. However, Huawei is now challenging the US brand with new phone lineups, potentially shifting the dynamics.

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, US lawmakers are actively pursuing a bill that would force Beijing-based ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a nationwide ban from app stores. This move underscores the ongoing tech war between the US and China.

Speaker Mike Johnson plans to include the TikTok divestiture legislation in an aid package for Ukraine and Israel that can be voted on as early as Saturday.

For those who missed it, early on Friday local time, explosions echoed over an Iranian city on Friday in what sources described as an Israeli attack,but Tehran played down the incident and indicated it had no plans for retaliation - a response that appeared gauged towards averting region-wide war.The limited scale of the attack and Iran's muted response both appeared to signal a successful effort by diplomats who have been working round the clock to avert all-out war since an Iranian drone and missile attack on Israel last Saturday. And so, after a whole lot of nothing overnight, as of 730am, S&P futures are practically unchanged at 5,045, Brent is actuallylowercompared to Thursday's close after briefly rising above $90 earlier, gold is unchanged, bonds are modestly firmer though have pared the majority of the overnight advances, and bitcoin is higher after aggressively dumping late on Thursday. There is nothing of significance on today's calendar.

Premarket, megacap tech are mostly lower: TSLA -1.8%, NVDA -1.1%, AMZN -95bp, META -91bp. NFLX tumbled fall 6.6% after the streaming-video company reported its first-quarter earnings. While the results were better than expected, with customer additions especially strong, its second-quarter revenue forecast was a slight disappointment. Here are some other notable premarket movers:

The latest fake escalation cap a dismal week for markets after solid economic readings and hawkish Fedspeak that have overturned Powell's December pivot and have forced investors to revise the timing of a keenly anticipated pivot to easier policy and the scale of potential rate cuts.

“With inflation sticky, central banks don’t have the option to look through spikes in oil prices, should they happen,” said Rajeev De Mello, a global macro portfolio manager at GAMA Asset Management. “They will have to revert to higher for longer rates which at this stage will be a shock to all markets.”

The latest the spook the market was NY Fed President John Williams who said while it isn’t his baseline expectation,even a rate hike is possible if warranted.His Atlanta counterpart Raphael Bostic said he doesn’t think it will be appropriate to ease until toward the end of 2024. The Fed may hold rates steady all year, Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari told Fox News Channel.

Meanwhile, on the geopolitical front, an Iranian military official signaled Tehran doesn’t feel compelled to react to the blasts which US officials say were caused by Israeli strikes, with semi-official Mehr agency quoting Army Commander-in-Chief Abdolrahim Mousavi saying Tehran has already reacted to Israeli threats. Despite Friday’s moves to allay fears of a wider war in the Mideast, the events are unsettling and will keep investors from taking bold bets, according to Michael Brown, strategist at Pepperstone Group Ltd. in London.

“No one will want to be short of crude and the havens ahead of the weekend,” he said. “From a risk-management perspective you can’t say definitively that geopolitical risk is done and dusted. So we may see another bout of de-risking. Ultimately it’s a case of people being reluctant to take on too much exposure.”

Europe's Stoxx 600 is down 0.4%, but it too reversed most of the overnight losses.  The food, beverage and tobacco sub-index leads gains whlie retail stocks decline the most. In company news, L’Oreal surged after better-than-expected quarterly sales. Here are the most notable European movers:

In FX, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is little changed while the Swiss franc remains the best performer among the G-10’s, rising 0.4% versus the greenback. The pound gains 0.1% with little reaction shown to weaker-than-expected UK retail sales data.

In rates, treasuries remain richer across the curve after paring the Asia-session advance sparked by reports Israel launched retaliatory strike on Iran. Yields lower by 4bp to 6bp as US trading gets under way, back toward middle of day’s range.US 10-year yields around 4.58% after briefly dropping below 4.50% during Asia session;inverted 2s10s spread remains near lows of the day as intermediates outperform, flatter by around 2bp.  Fed rate-cut expectations edged higher, with OIS pricing in 41bp of easing by year-end vs 38bp at Thursday’s close. Treasury coupon auctions next week — final ones of the February-to-April financing quarter — include 2-, 5- and 7-year notes Tuesday to Thursday.

In commodities, WTI crude oil futures are down ~1% near $82/bbl after erasing a more than 4% surge above $86/bbl as media in both countries appeared to downplay the severity of the incident. Gold is unchanged around $2377.

Bitcoin rises 2% ahead of the halving event expected later Friday.

US economic data slate empty for the session; Fed speakers include Goolsbee at 10:30am, and Fed releases Financial Stability Report at 4pm.

A more detailed look at global markets courtesy of Newsquawk

APAC stocks were lower across the board as the initial tech-related selling stemming from Wall St was exacerbated by reports of explosions in Iran following an Israeli operation although stocks are off today's worst levels as Iran downplayed and later denied the attack.ASX 200 was pressured with losses led by underperformance in tech and amid the bout of geopolitical-related turmoil. Nikkei 225 suffered intraday losses of around 3% and briefly dipped beneath the 37,000 level.Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp. were lower but with losses only mild compared to the regional counterparts

European bourses, Stoxx600 (-0.6%) are entirely in the red, with sentiment hit after Israel conducted an operation against Iran on a military airbase near Isfahan;though Iran later downplayed the attack, which helped to lift sentiment off worst levels, with contracts continuing to pare losses in otherwise quiet newsflow. European sectors hold a strong negative tilt; Industrials is found at the foot of the pile, with Schneider Electric (-1.9%) leading the losses. Autos are also lagging, after Nissan downgraded its guidance citing lower sales volume. US Equity Futures (ES -0.6%, NQ -0.8%, RTY 0.7%) are entirely in the red, though very much off worst levels seen overnight, sparked by the Israeli attacks on Iran. As for stock specifics, Netflix (-6.1%) is lower in the pre-market despite reporting strong headline metrics; however, the Co’s Q2 guidance fell short of expectations.

Geopolitics: Middle East

Central bank speakers

DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap

Markets are reacting to new developments in the Middle East overnight, as US officials have said that Israel had launched a missile strike against Iran . The news has raised fears that the conflict will escalate further, particularly since Iran had said they would respond to any attack, with the Iranian foreign minister having said they would “give a decisive and proper response” to any further military moves. The full details are still coming through, but Iran’s official news agency IRNA reported that they had activated air defence systems, and that flights in Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz had been suspended. And the New York Times reported three Iranian officials had said a strike hit a military air base near Isfahan early this morning.

In response, Brent crude oil prices (+2.04%) have spiked up to $88.89/bbl, although they have come down from their peak of $90.75/bbl immediately after the news came through. More broadly, the effects have been clear across global markets, and futures on the S&P 500 are down -0.85% this morning, which would put the index on track for a 6th consecutive decline for the first time since October 2022. In the meantime, investors have moved into safe havens, and the 10yr Treasury yield is down -8.0bps this morning to 4.55%, whilst gold prices are up +0.15%. Asian equities have also seen a decisive move lower overnight, including the Nikkei (-2.37%), the KOSPI (-1.63%), the Hang Seng (-1.23%), the CSI 300 (-0.88%) and the Shanghai Comp (-0.40%).

Before all that, markets followed a familiar pattern yesterday, with an initial stabilisation giving away to further losses once again. That meant the S&P 500 (-0.22%) lost ground for a 5th consecutive session, which hasn’t happened since last October, and the NASDAQ (-0.52%) fell to its lowest level in almost two months. Moreover, the latest declines mean that the S&P 500 is on track to post a third consecutive weekly decline for the first time since September, and the NASDAQ is on track for a fourth consecutive weekly decline for the first time since December 2022. So this marks a big shift from the rapid rally we saw from November up to the end of March, and it now leaves the S&P 500 down -4.63% from its recent peak, even before any moves today that futures are currently indicating.

The selloff wasn’t confined to equities, and before the geopolitical developments overnight, sovereign bonds also fell thanks to strong US data, which led investors to become increasingly sceptical the Fed would cut rates this year. For instance, the weekly initial jobless claims were at 212k (vs. 215k expected) over the week ending April 13, offering further evidence that the labour market was still resilient. Moreover, the Philadelphia Fed’s business outlook moved up to 15.5 in April (vs. 2.0 expected), which is the strongest reading in two years.

That scepticism about rate cuts got added support by comments from New York Fed President Williams, who said “I definitely don’t feel urgency to cut interest rates.” In response to a question, he commented that another rate hike wasn’t his baseline but that “if the data are telling us that we would need higher interest rates to achieve our goals, then we would obviously want to do that”. Meanwhile, Atlanta Fed President Bostic said that “I’m comfortable being patient”, reiterating his view that the Fed “won’t be in a position to reduce our rates until toward the end of the year”. In fact by the close, the amount of cuts priced in by the December meeting fell to 39bps, which is the fewest so far this year, although that’s since risen overnight to 43bps. And in turn, that led to a decent selloff for US Treasuries, with the 10yr yield (+4.6bps) back up to 4.63%, whilst the 2yr yield (+5.4bps) ended the day at 4.99%.

Over at the ECB however, several speakers continued to sound increasingly confident about a June cut. For instance, Finnish central bank governor Rehn said “Provided that we are confident that inflation will continue converging to our 2% target in a sustained way, the time will be ripe in June to start easing the monetary policy stance and to cut rates”. Austria’s Holzmann, one of the most hawkish ECB members, said that “If inflation develops as expected and, above all, the geopolitical problems don’t worsen, there will likely be a majority for an interest rate cut in June”. We also got some hints on what the ECB approach might look like beyond June. Lithuania’s Simkus considered about three rates cut this year as a baseline, while Latvia’s Kazaks saw “no rush in kind of further pace of rate cuts”. By contrast, France’s Villeroy suggested that consecutive rate cuts may be in play, noting that “When we say meeting by meeting, it can be at each following meeting — I don’t think, for example, that we should concentrate our rate cuts at quarterly meetings when we have a new forecast.” All this meant European sovereign bonds saw a smaller rise in yields than US Treasuries, with those on 10yr bunds (+3.1bps), OATs (+2.5bps) and BTPs (+1.4bps) all moving higher.

That backdrop meant that equities had another tough session. Initially they had looked to post a better performance, and the S&P 500 had been up by +0.69% intraday. But that began to reverse around the European close, leaving the index down -0.22%, in its 5th consecutive decline. Tech stocks led the underperformance again, and the Magnificent 7 (-0.49%) lost further ground, led by a -3.55% decline for Tesla . That said, banks (+0.99%) and communication services (+0.66%) outperformed, and over in Europe, which closed earlier in the day, the STOXX 600 advanced +0.24%.

In terms of yesterday’s other data, US existing home sales fell to an annualised rate of 4.19m in March (vs. 4.20m expected). Otherwise, the Conference Board’s Leading Index was down -0.3% in March (vs. -0.1% expected), which took the index down to its lowest level since May 2020. Overnight, we’ve also got the news that Japanese inflation fell to +2.7% in March (vs. +2.8% expected).

To the day ahead now, and central bank speakers include BoE Deputy Governor Ramsden, the BoE’s Mann, the Fed’s Goolsbee, and the ECB’s Nagel. Otherwise, data releases include UK retail sales and German PPI for March.

2024-04-19 08:20:00,Economic Warning From The NFIB,https://web.archive.org/web/20240419124149/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/economic-warning-nfib,"Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,

The latest National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) survey was an economic warning that departed widely from more robust governmental reports. Ina recent analysisof small businesses, we discussed the importance those business owners play in the economy.

“It is crucial to understand that small and mid-sized businesses comprise a substantial percentage of the U.S. economy.Roughly 60% of all companies in the U.S. have less than ten employees.

Small businesses drive the economy, employment, and wages. Therefore, the NFIB’s statements are highly relevant to the economy’s current statecompared to the headline economic data from Government sources.”

While recent government data on economic growth and employment remain robust, the NFIB small business confidence survey declined in its latest reading. Not only did it fall to the lowest level in 11 years, but, as far as an economic warning goes, it remained at levels historically associated with a recessionary economy.

The decline in confidence should be unsurprising given the largest deviation of interest rates from their 5-year average since 1975. Higher borrowing costs impede business growth for small businesses, as they don’t have access to the bond market like major companies.

Therefore, as the economy slows and interest rates rise, small business owners turn to their local banks for operating loans. However, higher rates and tighter lending standards make access to capital more difficult.

Of course, given that capital is the lifeblood of any business, decisions on hiring, capital expenditures, and expansion hang in the balance.

It should be unsurprising that if the economy were expanding as quickly as headline data suggests, business owners would be expending capital to increase capacity to meet rising demand. However, in the most recent NFIB report, the percentage of business owners planning capital expenditures over the 3-6 months dropped to the lowest level since the pandemic-driven shutdown.

Again, given that small businesses comprise about 50% of the economy, there is more than just a casual relationship between their capital expenditure plans (CapEx) and real gross private investment, which is part of the GDP equation.

In other words, if small businesses cut back on CapEx, this will eventually translate into slower rates of private investment and, ultimately, economic growth in coming quarters.

As shown, the correlation between small business CapEx plans and economic growth should not be dismissed. While mainstream economists are becoming increasingly optimistic about an“economic reflation,”the economic warning between real GDP and CapEx suggests caution.

Of course, if small businesses are unwilling to increase CapEx, it is because there is a lack of demand to justify those expenditures. Therefore, if CapEx is falling, we should expect economic warnings from employment and sales.

Many reasons feed into a small business owner’s decision NOT to invest in their business. As noted above, tighter bank lending standards and increased borrowing costs certainly weigh on that decision. However, if“business is booming,”business owners will find the capital needed to meet increased demand. However, looking deeper into the NFIB data, we find rising concerns about the“demand”side of the equation.

The NFIB publishes several data points from the survey concerning the“concerns”small business owners have. These cover many concerns, from government regulations to taxes, labor costs, sales, and other concerns confronting business owners. When it comes to the “demand” side of the equation, there are three crucial categories:

Cost of labor (the most significant expense to any business), and

Is it a “Good time to expand?”(Capex)

In the chart below, I have inverted“Good time to expand,”so it correlates with rising concerns about the cost of labor and poor sales. What should be obvious is that the average of these concerns escalates as economic growth weakens(recessionary periods)and falls during economic recoveries. Currently, these rising concerns should provide an economic warning to economists.

Examining sales and employment figures can help us understand why business owners remain pessimistic about the overall economy. The chart below shows the NFIB members’ sales expectations over the next quarter compared to the previous quarter. The black line is the average of both with a long-term median.

Unsurprisingly, business owners are always optimistic that sales will improve in the next quarter. However, actual sales tend to fall short of those expectations. The two have a very high correlation, which is why the average of both provides valuable information. Sales expectations and actual sales are well below levels typically witnessed during recessions. With sales(demand)weak, there is little need to increase production(supply)substantially.

Here is the economic warning to pay attention to. Real retail sales comprise about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), roughly 70% of the economic growth rate. The decline in the average of actual and expected sales of small businesses suggests weaker retail sales and, by extension, a slower economic growth rate.

The demand side of the economic equation is crucially important. If the demand for a business owner’s products or services declines, there is little need to increase employment. Therefore, if economic growth was as robust as headlines suggest, why are small businesses’ plans to increase employment declining sharply?

Furthermore, when demand falls, business owners look to cut operating costs to protect profitability. While cutting future employment is part of that equation, so are plans to raise worker compensation.

The last chart is crucial. The U.S. is a consumption-based economy. However, consumers can not consume without producing something first. Production must come first to generate the income needed for that consumption. The cycle is displayed below.

As employees receive fewer compensation increases(raises, bonuses, etc.)amid rising living costs, they cut consumption, which translates into slower economic growth rates. In turn, business owners cut employment and compensation further. It is a virtual spiral that historically ends in recession.

While this time could certainly be different,the economic warnings from the NFIB survey should not be dismissed.The data could explain why the Fed is becomingmore adamant about cutting rates.

2024-04-19 08:40:00,Police Surround Iran Consulate In Paris Where Man Threatens To Blow Himself Up,https://web.archive.org/web/20240419124149/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/police-surround-iran-consulate-paris-where-man-threatens-blow-himself,"A major police and emergency response is ongoing outside the Iranian consulate in Paris on Friday, wherea man is reportedly threatening to blow himself upin what's possibly some kind of hostage standoff.

Police are asking the public to avoid the area and say that security services intervention in the situation is imminent. ""Service was interrupted on a nearby metro line for security reasons,"" the RATP metro companyhas alertedthe public.

The consulate is at Rue Fresnel in the 16th district, and the standoff comes just hours after an overnight Israeli aerial attack on Iran, which involved drones infiltrating and also possibly Israeli jets firing from over Iraqi airspace.

However, Iran-Israel situation has since avoided tit-for-tat escalation since the overnight assault, with theIranians saying they do not plan to respond and escalate further.

Currently few details are known, with conflicting reports saying the man may have asuicide veston, or is carrying several grenades under his belt. French security services have at this point revealed little, and likely themselves possess few verified details of the situation.

Local media footage has shown heavily armed police units cordoning off the area where the consulate is located. It's unclear how many Iranian diplomats and consular workers might be inside.

Today marks bitcoin's 4th halving, after which bitcoin's 5th halving epoch will begin. We'll discuss that at the end. First, let's talk about last night's geopolitical flare-up in the Middle East.

World War III is trending and we get a bitcoin halving? And here I thought that April would be a quiet month of consolidation...

The conflict between Israel and Iran continues to escalate. Last week, Iran attacked Israel, and a retaliatory strike from Israel on Iranian military targets occurred yesterday night that was reportedly thwarted by Iranian forces.

Oil surged on the news. The threat of sanctions and embargos on oil to Western countries, targeting of oil infrastructure during war, geopolitical risks in the Middle East, and the fact that the United States' Strategic Petroleum Reserve is at a 40-year low of just 19 days of supply have and will continue to contribute to the massive spike in crude prices. God forbid a hot global conflict arises.

You think gas prices are bad now? Just wait until the United States gets dragged into a hot war with only 19 days' worth of petroleum in the tank. A $6/gallon nationwide average sounds impossible now, but it'll seem a lot less impossible when it's on the screen at your local station:

Gold once again challenged its all-time high on Thursday night just as markets opened in the east. It has corrected a little bit after news that Israel's strike was unsuccessful. Still, the transient spike in gold's price tells the story: gold is the best hedge against geopolitical risk in markets today.

Not to mention it is an accurate reflection of true price inflation. Gold is gaining on stock growth on a percentage basis year-to-date, up 17.8% compared to the 5.7% increase in the S&P 500. Stocks are starting to slide now. The Nasdaq 100 hit a fresh 10-week low today, while gold is still pressing forward. Risk-off? Not just yet.

A correction of this size is typical in the stock market. As the economy stays nominally hot and the Federal Reserve refuses to rule out further hikes, paired with geopolitical risk that would force the US Treasury to ramp up debt issuance to fund the conflict, the threat of direct Fed UST-buying and the money printing that will ensue to make it happen is looming, albeit far off, but gold smells it:

Safe haven flows also came for the US Treasury market. The world's preferred collateral and the bedrock of the global financial system is still traded like the apex risk-off asset in global financial markets. It always gets bid in crisis. Yields are still at their cycle highs, though. The 10-year yield has risen 80 basis points and the 2-year yield has risen 76 basis points, meaning that both bonds are selling off as investors still sniff out nominally hot economic activity and for the Fed to hold interest rates high for longer than anticipated to try and correct it.

Bitcoin is not a geopolitical hedge, at least at the outset of conflict. This was made abundantly clear on Thursday with the way it was traded following the news out of the Middle East, with it tanking $4,000 from $63,600 to a local low of $59,600. It has since recovered and is now back above the $64,000 mark, but the initial trade, like with gold, tells the story: on the threat of hot war, investors sold their bitcoin. This is another factor that has added to the multi-month consolidation trend that bitcoin has experienced between $60,000 and $70,000:

As I mentioned inMonday's post:this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it is simply a reflection of market inefficiency.

The US Treasury is already running a $2-trillion deficit and is 50% over budget for 2024. In the threat of hot war, where debt issuance will ramp up further, massive flight from risk will create an initial investment glut, and the Fed steps in with rate cuts and possible direct buying to support the US Treasury market,you want to hold what they can't make more of.Let's call itdebasement insurance.

Bitcoin isthe bestdebasement insurance. It performs gold's principle function of hedging against monetary inflation better than gold does because it has no supply response. Gold supply issuance will rise as it continues to shatter all-time highs; miners will increase capital investment to mine more gold, acting as a headwind to drive the price down with more supply coming online. Bitcoin's supply issuance will fall by 50% in a few hours, programmatically, even though it's at all-time highs. Its supply schedule, the rate at which new BTC is minted, can't be adjusted upward for miners to capture more revenue.

Only the Bitcoin network puts monetary policy above the profit incentive. Only bitcoin is perfectly supply inelastic. That's on top of BTC being more portable, divisible, and verifiable than gold. The icing on the cake is that as of ~9:00 PM EST today, April 19th, 2024, bitcoin will be scarcer than gold. After its 4th halving from 6.25 BTC per block (every ~10 minutes) to 3.125 BTC per block, bitcoin's stock-to-flow ratio will be higher than gold's mean stock-to-flow ratio of 70 over the last 100 years. Markets aren't perfectly efficient, and this is one of the most assymetric trades in history for those willing to set aside their pride, learn about bitcoin's properties and their immutability, and position themselves accordingly:

Final thought: the endgame for the US' fiscal and monetary situation is a certainty. Hold bitcoin and hold it tightly. Might I suggest amulti-sig vault?

This is Jp Cortez, the executive director of the Sound Money Defense League, and I’m here today speaking to an old friend of mine, Jeff Deist. Jeff is the general at Monetary Metals, the former President of the Mises Institute, and formerly the Chief of Staff for Congressman Ron Paul. Jeff, thank you so much for chatting with me today. I’m looking forward to this.

Absolutely, Jp Good to see you.

Let’s start, you, obviously, with your very deep background in Austrian economics and libertarianism, generally ideas of freedom, we are today experiencing inflation at a rate that we haven’t seen in decades. Americans are finding it harder to feed their families or warm their homes or even get an apartment, a car, a medicine, whatever it is. Right now, inflation is a dinnertime conversation, and it can no longer be hidden, the effects that all this deficit spending and printing of money, how the effects of that we’re now seeing them play out. What do you think? Are you expecting inflation to get worse? And how does sound money play into this inflation we’re seeing today?

I don’t know that I expect it to get worse. I expect it to be stubborn. In other words, I think we’re going to have at least a decade where people feel pain of pretty robust annual price inflation. We’re talking at the store. The official CPI seems to be holding right now at 3%, which is not the 2% target. We all know that actual price inflation is much higher than that. Larry Summers, the former Harvard President, just admitted a week or so ago, If we calculated it the same way we did back in the ’70s and ’80s, actually, And there’s a million small ways where people are paying more that isn’t just how much at the grocery cost, but things like insurance. And you’re paying insurance even as a renter. One way or another, we’re all paying insurance. Auto insurance, I know a lot of more providers have left California, for example. Flood insurance down in places like Florida, I think that’s going to get quite expensive. And so there’s a million other ways in which people are paying. And it’s very hard for politicians to say that this isn’t really happening with a straight faith anymore.

Here’s the thing is we haven’t experienced anything like this, really, since the early 1980s. So the late ’70s, early ’80s, the Paul Volcker era was when inflation, price inflation Inflation really peaked in the American psyche as a a thing in our lives, something that we have to live with, almost like when the Iraq war is going on, that’s a thing in our lives. Inflation feels like that. It feels like something on our back. And so you have a couple of generations of economists, media people, politicians, whatever, basically, really anybody under about 60 or 50 years of age who has simply never experienced an inflationary environment. So from 1982, until about COVID-2022, that 40-year period or thereabouts. Obviously, established interest rates were going down. We can argue about whether the Fed sets them or targets them. I’m increasingly skeptical as to the power of the Fed to do that, but certainly the Fed influences them. So interest rates went down and down and down for about 40 years, and prices didn’t really rise dramatically in a way that hurt people. And so we’re in this new normal. It’s going to take people a while to get used to I would argue that inflation is at least 8%, might be 10 %, really.

Shadow stats, I think, that number is closer to that.

But we have to view this, I think, very, very differently than the past in the sense that there are two forces at work here still. One is just that I think this is much more on the fiscal side than the monetary policy side, because if you look at the amount of just actual money created around this two huge stimulus bills, bills during COVID, one in the Trump administration, one under the Biden administration. I mean, those injected directly more than $6 trillion of cash-cash into people’s bank accounts, businesses, individuals. I mean, that’s not the Fed. The other thing is, of course, is that we are still experiencing a lot of supply issues from COVID shutdowns. The economy is not like your lawnmower. You don’t just pull the cord and turn it back on and resume mowing. That’s not how it works. There’s a temporary a moral element to this that Austrians understand, I think, a lot better than the Paul Krugman’s. And there’s also a malinvestment element to this. If you were invested in certain processes that got shut down during COVID, you might be gun-shy reinvesting in those. And so we still don’t have supply chains the way as robust as we had them before.

We don’t even have employment, really, back up to the levels of pre-COVID. So while obviously people in the Austrian camp tend to blame If they gain 10 pounds, it’s because of the Fed, right? But I think on this time, we have to look at it a lot differently and say that this is also a fiscal and regulatory phenomenon. And I don’t think it’s going away soon. And so all of us, we all have our personal finances to think of, all of us are just going to have to readjust to this new normal. And so I think people are going to be out there saying, what do I got to do to I just tread water with my money? I mean, it’s a lot like it distorts human activity in a different way. But when interest rates are really, really low and nobody could get even 4, 5% on, let’s say, their money market funds. People went out and tried to buy equities. They tried to chase yield because I’m not getting any interest at the bank. Now that interest rates are higher, people are getting more conservative with their money, and they’re just trying to figure out how to Gee, whiz, how can I maintain 5, 6, 7% a year?

Because if not, it really feels like you’re losing. You always have been, but now people feel it.

Of course. And like you were just saying there, in many cases, and I’m thinking maybe about specifically a state’s balance sheets. Most states are heavily invested in commercial paper debt or treasuries or third-world debt, many of which don’t own a single ounce of gold to their name. And if you’re telling me that these assets or these investments are gaining you 4 or 5%, but the real rate of inflation is closer to 8%, what you’re telling me is that you’re losing 3%, you’re making a negative real rate of return there. Yeah, I think it’s because it’s undeniable now and you look all over and people are having a harder time understanding how this can be. There have been a million different misdirections and pivots starting from, originally, there would be no inflation. I’m sure you remember press secretaries going before television cameras and saying things, saying every single economy… We’ve spoken to economists, and every single economist we spoke to assured us that there would be no inflation. And then it became, Oh, wait, there is inflation, but it’s transitory. And then it became, oh, wait, there is inflation. It’s not transitory. It’s Putin’s fault. And then it became, well, it’s the CEO of Kroger, the CEO of your local grocery store.

So all of these, it’s all sleight of hand, right? Because the Fed, because this monetary dysfunction stems comes from the federal policies and the Federal Reserve. But that doesn’t happen in a vacuum. And people down here in Alabama, if I’m in Des Moines, if I’m in Lincoln, I’m seeing there are people living on the streets. America, it’s degrading from the inside. So much of that, I think, has to do with the money, and people are starting to wake up to that. Wait, why? Because is no one uses the dollar because they want to. It wasn’t an explicit choice. No one woke up in the morning and opened their closet and looked through all of the types of potential monies and said, That one, the US dollar. The truth is, many of the alternatives that could potentially make good monies are saddled with regulations, with taxes, with all these disincentives that don’t allow them to be used as money. It’s not that the US dollar is the best monetary instrument that could exist, it’s that we’re trapped. To the extent that the dollar or money is a good, there are varying degrees of quality of that good.

That means money can be done very poorly. It can also be done very well. I would say, insofar as the US government or the Federal Reserve, a independent institution, has a fiduciary responsibility to protecting the value or the savings of Americans, they’ve been extremely poor stewards of that. In America, obviously, we’re seeing people wake up to just basic questions about money. Simply, why do we use money? What problem does money solve? Where does it derive its value? I personally can attest to going state to state and seeing state legislators make it easier for individuals to buy and invest and save in gold and silver. It’s also making it easier for the state itself if they want to protect their own coffers. They’re now in many cases, in some cases, allowing treasurers to protect their wealth, their taxpayer funds with gold and silver. People are waking up, states are waking up. Coal countries are waking up. We were talking before we started to hear about the It feels like a grassroots movement that’s popping up through sections of Latin America between El Salvador, between what we saw in the UFC octagon in Brazil, between Milei and Argentina.

There are fundamental questions because sound money doesn’t exist in a vacuum. There are other things. That sound money itself has great implications to what a government can do, what it can’t do, maybe more importantly. Those things are inherently intertwined with freedom, with liberty, with autonomy. We’re seeing these things light up all over the world. I’m your take on this as someone who was obviously in the thick at the Mises Institute. Do you see that Mises’s works and the Austrian school and the sound money ideas, do you see those being adopted around the world more maybe than in previous years?

Well, it’s hard to say. There’s certainly a reason for hope. And oftentimes, things happen very slowly over one’s lifetime, maybe even beyond one’s lifetime. You could say you might I trace the Trump phenomenon, for example, back to Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot in the early ’90s, right? Sometimes things have to percolate for a while, and then they find purchase in a particular individual. I would like to think that Ron Paul and his two campaigns had something to do with bringing awareness of the idea of what money is and how it would work. And I do think that this Austrian versus neoclassical or Keynesian thing It is coming to a head.

Is that where you think the battle is right now between Austrians and Neokeynesian? Where do the MMT’ers fit?

It’s beyond that. I’d like to think that what it is, but I think it’s more about objective reality. In other words, there’s an entire academic movement that’s dedicated to making intellectual arguments for unreality. We can just have all these things. We can just have green energy at somehow no cost to us. In fact, we’ll create jobs, and we can just paper over deficits because we owe it to ourselves. And we can fund anything we want to because as MMT tells us, the United States is a sovereigncurrencyissuer and can never run out of it. So we’re only resource constrained. Resource constrained sounds an awful to me like the entire fundamentalbasisof economics, which is scarcity. And scarcity requires choice, and choice This requires subjective valuation and all kinds of things. But when government comes along in mucks with money, that really has a profound effect on a society far beyond just what we think of as economics. And it puts all of us almost in quicksand because if you’re an American, you probably get paid in dollars, and you probably have your bank account in dollars. Not a lot you can do about that.

If you’re very wealthy, you can diversify across jurisdictions, maybe have other passports, have savings in other countries. Frankly, the US dollar is outperforming all. So why would you want to? But for average people, it’s tough. And I hope that there’s an awareness growing, and maybe the reality of human nature is it just takes some pain to get people to change their thinking.

Sure. And so with the money, I think, I would say being broken. So you’ve got a more abundant currency, and that in and of itself enables a lot of things, right? When you can spend endlessly, you’re less likely to be considerate about how you spend You’re maybe more likely to go through expenditures that you wouldn’t otherwise. In many cases, unfortunately, when we’re talking about governments, that can play itself out in the form of wars. And in many cases, in the American case here, America has been fighting wars of choice, not wars of need for many decades. I would say, and I’ve made the argument, that endless printing of money enables this endless war. It’s not an accident that America keeps fighting wars. It’s not an accident that you have homeless people living on the street outside of state capitals and outside of state legislators all around the country. But scraping together another 60 billion for Ukraine or Israel or whatever the war de jour is, there’s no problem ever in doing that. I think that’s something that has been happening insidiously or sneakily for decades. But now, I think with us being more interconnected with social media and with people, governments no longer being able to hide what is so plain in the face of so many people, we’re seeing that there’s a, and I’m willing to concede that I might be a little too close to it, but I see a sound money movement here, and I’m very bullish, personally, on states’ individuals re-adopting their own gold standards.

This is probably something you’ve seen, the work you’ve been doing at Monetary Metals, very different, I would think, from the academic work done at the Mises Institute. Tell me about what you all have been doing. The idea, I think, and you would better explain it than me, but to to have it be a yield-bearing asset. Gold is the bottom of the pyramid, it’s base layer money. To be able to monetize that would be incredibly useful for the purposes of sound money and for people trying to save and invest for the future. So tell me a little bit about that.

Well, it just seems that it’s a terrible tragedy, really, that there’s, at today’s price, it’s almost $16 trillion worth of gold above the ground in the world. Now, a lot of that is in Central of banks. But nonetheless, that’s a financial asset. We can say it’s not money because governments have decreed that it is not, but it’s nonetheless a financial asset. And as I mentioned in a show last week with Ben Nadelstein, I think the proof of that is that gold trades at a higher per ounce price than its mere jewelry or industrial usage. I don’t think it would be $2,300.

$2,400 as of this, yeah.

If it were simply a commodity for its gold, excuse me, its jewelry and industrial uses. So I do think that there is a monetary moneyness to gold that is reflected in its price. That the market tells us. We don’t have to decree that. So that’s important. And why is a 16 $15 trillion asset not being used as collateral to pledge to backstop insurance, to fund all kinds of production and all kinds of businesses and industries around the world. Well, basically because people have locked up gold and don’t view it in those terms. And so we’re trying to make a tiny chink in that armor and start pulling some of this moneyness out of gold by using it to finance production or use it to finance inventory. And this has been a really interesting experiment because most investments, most things people do, whether they put money in a bank to earn interest or whether they invest it in a stock or a bond to earn whatever return, they’re thinking in terms of dollars. What Monetary Metals does is an ounces business. In other words, we take ounces, we report in ounces, and we return ounces if you want them back.

So we’re trying to grow ounces, not dollars. And so that’s a very different mindset. It’s a very unique offering. And I hope we can grow it into something that really works. And I hope we can do so without the government coming along and doing something terrible to us. I hope we can be Uber. And so by the time they catch on, it’s too popular, something like that. But I’m agnostic on the gold versus Bitcoin fight. I’ve been knee deep in that, waist deep in that. And so I’m not anti-Bitcoin, and I own Bitcoin. I wish it well. I’m pro any system system that rests control of money away from government and central banks. I think that’s key. And when you talk about some of these states you visit, it would be very, very, very helpful to get rid of that 28 % collectibles rate on gold at the federal level, which means every time you use gold, You can’t go to the pawn shop and buy something that would be considered a taxable event, which is a real tragedy. People want to accept it for money. They should be allowed to. But nonetheless, I do agree.

I do think there’s a feeling out there about sound money, and I’m very interested in knowing what states can do to protect themselves in terms of legislation or a gold depository, some favorable Bitcoin treatment. I know Caitlyn Long, Wyoming, tried to do a lot in that arena. We have to do something. I think that’s clear.

Yeah. And I think one of my favorite things about monetary metals and what you all are doing and how the Sound Money Defense League, how our work dovetails in what you all and others are doing, I think, is to remove the briers and the thicket and all of the things that surround gold and silver or Bitcoin even. And so to clear all this out so that really smart people can innovate within this space. The US dollar has been the US dollar for a long time. Unless you’re calling quantitative easing and financial alchemy, that being innovation outside of those things, there hasn’t really been a ton of innovation in the money space. I guess when things went digital, 25 years ago, there was some of that. But we’re seeing today, I think, innovation like more fractional gold, smaller gold pieces than we’ve ever seen so that they could be used as money. We’re seeing innovation in the space of Bitcoin and some of those second-layer solutions to make it workable as money. And I think that goes back to what I mentioned earlier about how it’s not that anyone chose the dollar. It’s simply that everything else that could potentially be workable as money is saddled with taxes and such.

So like you said, the 28 %, that’s a federal capital gains long term rate on commodities, which gold and silver were deemed by the IRS not by statute. The IRS unilaterally, by rule, decided gold and silver are the same assets or similar assets as baseball cards and beanie babies and works of art. To that front, good news on that front, I actually just confirmed, I believe it was yesterday, congressman Alex Mooney will be reintroducing legislation to eliminate that incorrect treatment of gold and silver as a collectible on the federal level. We’re seeing, hopefully, movement on that front, because like you said, if I’m buying $100 worth of groceries and I’m trying to do that with a couple of Silver Eagles, when I go to pay my groceries, I think to myself, Oh, man, did I buy these Silver Eagles on the same day? What was the price when I bought them? What’s my cost basis? And now I have to report a gain, and now the feds are going to tax me, and then the state is going to tax me as well. As a question of the burden is too high, it’s not workable as money.

And so that, I think, allowing people the choice, allowing for competition and money to go back to the Hayekian idea of denationalizing currency and letting the market decide what makes the best money. And so I think Because money is such a societal tool, it’s something that when I spend it, it’s because I value the thing that I’m wanting more than I value the dollars. When I spend it, it’s because I want to voice support for a certain good or a cause. The flip side of that is when I choose not to spend it, I’m choosing to withhold my support. So this is a communicative tool. And I think what we’re seeing by that, that’s idea that that is what money is used for, you can see how easily, for example, something like a CBDC could potentially or quickly endanger one’s rights to withhold support in one case or to support certain things in another. The Canadians being an obvious example of a government squishing a movement that it didn’t like. There are stories out of Africa, out of Hong Kong, where liberty groups, fight groups, fighting their government for freedom, are having to use blockchain technologies or having to use Bitcoin because the power that comes with a centralized money is the power to completely quell any resistance, completely squash anyone that the government deems worthy of squishing.

The anti-CVDC thing, I think, is becoming a very popular idea. Over the last couple of years, Kristi Noem in South Dakota has signed a couple of these bills into law. Tennessee did recently. As of an hour ago, Nebraska senators voted unanimously to end capital gains on gold and silver and to declare that CVDCs are not money in the state of Nebraska. So you can’t force us to pay taxes in it. You can’t force us to adopt it. And so this is something that’s becoming more popular. I think Ron DeSantis might have been the first one to sign one of these bills into law and likening it to the Chinese social credit score or something like that, where your lifeline can so easily be snipped by a government should you choose to step out, should you choose to say the wrong thing, you’re cut off. And that, I think, is one of the dangers outside of entirely consolidating the entire banking system, outside of the ability to tax or to tax savings, negative interest rates. Outside of those things, there is a massive privacy issue that sound money protects."
2024-04-19 18:00:00,The World's Economic Myths Are Hitting Their Limits,https://web.archive.org/web/20240420092653/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/worlds-economic-myths-are-hitting-their-limits#comment-stream,"Authored by Gail Tverberg via Our Finite World blog,

There are many myths about energy and the economy.In this post I explore the situation surrounding some of these myths.

My analysis strongly suggests that the transition to a new Green Economy is not progressing as well as hoped.

Green energy planners have missed the point that our physics-based economy favors low-cost producers.

In fact, the US and EU may not be far from an economic downturn because subsidized green approaches are not truly low-cost.

The focus on ownership of condominium homes is beginning to unwind, with huge repercussions for the Chinese economy. In March, new home pricesin China declined by 2.2%, compared to a year earlier. Property salesfell by 20.5%in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period a year ago, and new construction starts measured by floor area fell by 27.8%. Overall property investment in China fell by 9.5% in the first quarter of 2024. No one is expecting a fast rebound. The Chinese seem to be shifting their workforce from construction to manufacturing, but this creates different issues for the world economy, which I describe in Section [6].

In the US, the rate of growth was only 3.3% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to 47% one year ago. Tesla has made headlines, saying that it islaying off 10%of its staff. It also recently reported that it isdelaying deliveriesof its cybertruck. A big issue is the high prices of EVs; another is the lack of charging infrastructure. If EV sales are to truly expand, they will need both lower prices and much better charging infrastructure.

A forecast made by the trade group Solar Energy Industries Association and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie indicates that US solar panel installations by homeowners are expected tofall by 13%in 2024. There are many issues involved: higher interest rates, less generous subsidies to homeowners, not enough grid capacity for new generation, and too much overproduction of electricity by solar panels in the spring and fall, when heating and air conditioning demand is low. The overproduction issue is particularly acute in California.

For each individual 24-hour day, the timing of solar energy production does not match up well with when it is needed. With sufficient batteries, solar electricity produced in the morning can help run air conditioners in the evening. But storage from summer to winter is still not feasible, and batteries for short-term storage are expensive.

Strangely enough, in the US and the EU, when wind and solar are added to the electric grid, electricity supplies seem to get tighter. For example, onearticle says,Most of US electric grid faces risk of resource shortfall through 2027, NERC [regulatory group] says.

Charts of electricity supply per capita show an unusual trend when wind and solar are added. Figure 1 shows that, in the US, once wind and solar are added, total electricity generation per capita falls, rather than rises!

Figure 1. US per capita electricity generation based on data of the US Energy Information Administration. (Data is through 2023, even though this is not easy to see from the labels.)

The EU, using a somewhat shorter history period, shows a similar pattern of declining total electricity generation per capita, even when wind and solar are added (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Electricity generation per capita for the European Union based on data of the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy, prepared by the Energy Institute. Amounts are through 2022.

I believe that the strange pricing systems used for wind and solar in the US and EU are driving out other electricity suppliers, especially nuclear. With this system, intermittent electricity enjoys the subsidy of going first at the regular wholesale market rate. Other providers find themselves with very low or negative wholesale rates in the spring and fall of the year and on weekends and holidays. As a result, their overall return falls too low. Nuclear is particularly affected because it requires a huge, fixed investment, and it cannot be ramped up and down easily.

Besides the foregoing issues affecting thesupplyof electricity generated, there are also factors affecting thedemandfor electricity. Electricity generation using wind and solar tends to be high priced when all costs are included. The US and EU are already high-cost areas for businesses to operate. High electricity rates further add to the impetus to move manufacturing and other industry to lower-cost countries if businesses desire to be competitive in the world market.

On a world basis, in 2022, wind and solar added about 13% to total world electricity generation (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Electricity generation per capita for the World based on data of the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy, prepared by the Energy Institute. Amounts are through 2022.

Based on Figure 3, with the addition of wind and solar, the upward slope of the world per capita electricity generation has been able to remain pretty much constant from 1985 to 2022, at about 1.6% per year. But the US and the EU, as high-cost producers of goods and services, haven’t been able to participate in this per capita growth of electricity.

Instead, China has been a major beneficiary of the shift of manufacturing overseas from the US and EU. It has been able to rapidly increase its electricity supply per capita, even with wind and solar. It has also been adding both nuclear and coal-fired electricity generation capacity.

Figure 4. Electricity generation per capita for China based on data of the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy, prepared by the Energy Institute. Amounts are through 2022.

Thus, this analysis produces the result a person would expect if the physics of the world economy favors efficient (low-cost) producers.

Both EV production and AI are heavy users of electricity supply. We have seen that the US and the EU no longer have growing per-capita electricity supplies. Ramping up electricity generation would require a long lead time (10 years or more), a major increase in fossil fuel consumption, and an increase in electricity transmission lines.

The State of Georgia, in the United States, is already running into this issue, with planned data centers (related to AI) and EV manufacturing plants. The state plans to add newgas-fired electricity generation. It will also import more electricity from Mississippi Power, where the retirement of a coal-fired plant is being delayed to provide the necessary additional electricity. Eventually, more solar panels are planned, as well.

The world economy depends upon a growing bubble of debt. It also depends on an ever-increasing supply of goods and services. In fact, the two are closely interrelated. As long as a growing supply of low-priced energy of the types used by built infrastructure is available, the economy tends to sail along.

China, with problems in its property business, is an example of what can go wrong when energy supplies (coal in China) become expensive, as supply becomes increasingly constrained. Figure 5 shows that China’s per-capita coal supply became constrained in about 2013. China’s per capita coal extraction had been rising, but then it dipped. This made it more difficult for builders to construct the homes planned for would-be homeowners. This is part of what got home builders in China into financial difficulty.

Figure 5. Per capita coal supply in China based on data of the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy, prepared by the Energy Institute. Amounts are through 2022.

Finally, in 2022, China was able to get coal production up. But the way this was done was through very high coal prices (Figure 6). (The prices shown are for Australian coal, but Chinese coal prices seem to be similar.)

Figure 6. Newcastle Coal (Australia) prices in chart prepared byTrading Economics.

Building concrete homes at such high coal prices would have resulted in new homes that were far too expensive for most Chinese citizens to afford. If builders were not already in difficulty from low supply, adding high coal prices, as well, would be a second blow. Furthermore, all the workers formerly engaged in home building needed new places to earn a living; the current approach seems to be to move many of these workers to manufacturing, so that the popping of the home building bubble will have less of an impact on the overall economy of China.

There is now concern that China isramping up its manufacturing, particularly for exports, at a time when China’s jobs in the property sector are disappearing. The problem, however, is that ramping up exports of manufactured goodscreates a new bubble. This huge added supply of manufactured goods can only be sold at low prices. This new low-priced competition seems likely to lead to manufacturers, around the world, obtaining too-low prices for their manufactured products.

If other economies around the world are forced to compete with even lower-cost goods from China, it could have an adverse impact on manufacturing around the world. With low prices, manufacturers are likely to lay off workers, or give them excessively low wages. If wages and prices are inadequate, debt bubbles in other parts of the world are likely to collapse. This will happen because many borrowers will become unable to repay their debt. This is the reason that we have been hearing a great deal recently about raising tariffs on Chinese exports.

I have pointed out previously that based on physics considerations, economies cannot be expected to be permanent structures. Economies and humans are both self-organizing systems that grow. Humans get their energy from food. Economies are powered by the types of energy products that our built infrastructure uses. Neither can grow forever. Neither can get along without energy products of the right types, in the right quantities.

We become so accustomed to the narratives we hear that we tend to assume that what we are told must be right. These narratives could be based on wishful thinking, or on inadequate models, or on asour grapesview that says, “We don’t want fossil fuels anyhow.” We know that humans need food, and that economies will continue to require fossil fuels. We can’t make wind turbines or solar panels without fossil fuels. What do we plan to do for energy without fossil fuels?

In a finite world, economies cannot continue forever. We don’t know precisely what will go wrong or when it will go wrong, but we can get a hint from the recent failures of myths that our economy may change dramatically in the not-too-distant future.

""A huge blastrocked a military base used by Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF)to the south of Baghdad late on Friday,"" army sources said toReuters.

Fires are still going at the Kalso base in Babel, Iraq after what appears to be an airstrike.pic.twitter.com/ipyZ1CgUxg

Few other details have been given, but images are widely circulating online showing what indeed appears to be a very large-scale strike.

A number of regional correspondents have been quick to identify it as anAmerican military airstrike; however,given the events of the night prior(the 'limited' attack on Iran), others are speculating it was the Israelis behind it.

On April 17,#Iraq's national security advisor Qasim Al Araji, a member of#IRGCterrorists-backed Badr Organization, said#Iran's regime's attack on#Israelon April 13 created ""a new deterrent policy"" in the region. And this is Israel's response to him tonight in Iraq:pic.twitter.com/u3T2bBMAL0

Both the Israelis and Americans have struck Iran-linked PMF bases before, mostly in Eastern Syria - but a strike on such a scale inside Iraq by Israel remains very rare or even unprecedented.

Of course, since this again takes place when he market is closed the only way to trade it is via bitcoin, where the algos have decided to price in the end of the world for the third time in 5 days.

We are aware of reports claiming that the United States conducted airstrikes in Iraq today. Those reports are not true. The United States has not conducted air strikes in Iraq today.

Russia was India’s single largest oil supplier for a second consecutive fiscal year,as surging imports of Russian crude dragged down the share of OPEC and Middle East supply to India to a record low, Reutersreportedon Friday, citing data from tanker-tracking data obtained from industry sources.

In the 2023/2024 fiscal year ended March 31, the share of Middle East oil supply of India’s oil imports slumped to as low as 46% -- the lowest on record dating back to 2001-2002, according to the Reuters analysis. This compares with a 55% share of the Middle Eastern crude supply of Indian imports in the previous fiscal year 2022/2023.

The key driver of historically low Indian imports from the Middle East was the surge in Russian crude supply to the world’s third-largest oil importer.

Russia alone accounted for around 35% of all Indian crude oil imports in 2023/2024, per the data compiled by Reuters.

For the first time ever, India – which depends on imports for around 87% of its oil consumption – imported roughly equal volumes of OPEC and non-OPEC crude,thanks to the 57% annual surge in imports from non-OPEC producer Russia.

Higher prices of Saudi crude and lower Kuwaiti supply as Kuwait limited exports of some grades to direct them to a new refinery also contributed to the low share of the OPEC and Middle Eastern crude of India’s imports.

India’s crude imports remained flat in the 2023/2024 fiscal year, but the import bill of the world’s third-largest oil importerfell by almost 16%due to lower oil prices and record-high imports of cheaper Russian crude.

While volumes were essentially unchanged, India’s spending on crude oil imports dropped by 16%, to $132.4 billion in 2023/2024, down from the $157.5 billion import bill for the 2022/2023 fiscal year, provisional data from the Indian Oil Ministry showed earlier this week.

For any Zero Hedge readers who are aviators, you already know that as a pilot in command in airspace controlled by a tower, you're putting complete trust in air traffic controllers to guide you on the most effective path possible without hitting other planes.

But that was almost not the case on Thursday morning when air traffic control instructed Southwest Airlines Flight 2937 to cross runway four at the airport while JetBlue Flight 1554 took off.

The audio is absolutely shocking. For any pilot, it sends shivers down your spine...

Joe Biden’s Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, threatened during a congressional hearing to weaponize the Department of Education totarget and shut down the largest Christian university in the United States.

AsFox Newsreports, Cardona made his threats during a hearing before the House Appropriations Committee, in response to a question by far-left Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.).DeLauro attacked Grand Canyon University (CGU), falsely declaring it ""a predatory for-profit school,"" to which Cardona said that “we are cracking down not only to shut them down, but to send a message to not prey on students.”

“You have a shiny brochure and a great commercial,” Cardona said.

“But the product is not worth the paper it’s written on. We have students graduating 60K to 70K dollars in debt, only eligible for jobs making under 30K. That to me is unacceptable.”

GCU has been accused of misleading students about the true cost of some of its doctoral programs, for which Cardona’s Education Department fined the university $37.7 million; the school is currently appealing that fine, which was implemented in November.

Past fines imposed by the Education Department on other schools were significantly smaller, with Penn State being fined just $2.4 million for its failure to deal with Jerry Sandusky’s sexual crimes; Michigan State was fined only $4.5 million for its similar failure to respond to the crimes of Larry Nassar.

In October, the department claimed that an investigation by the office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) determined that GCU had “lied” about the true costs of its doctoral programs to over 7,500 students, while presenting no evidence.

The department then gave GCU just 20 days to request a hearing with the department’s Office of Hearings and Appeals to object to the fine.

“Our next recourse after that decision would be another appeal within the Department, this time directly to the Secretary of Education,” said a GCU spokesman.

“Officials continue to make derogatory and inflammatory public statements that are legally and factually incorrect and not shared by any of the other 26 regulatory and accrediting bodies that oversee GCU,”the GCU spokesman continued.

“The Secretary’s comments to the House Appropriations Committee were so reckless that GCU is demanding an immediate retraction, as they do not reflect the factual record in this case. He is either confused, misinformed or does not understand the actions taken by his own agency.”

In response to Cardona’s threats, the American Principles Project (APP) haslaunched a petition to “protect Christian colleges.”

The petition says, in part, that in “light of the Biden administration’s unprecedented attacks on our nation’s largest Christian colleges,” the AFP andall signatories to the petition demand that “the administration halt their crusade and let students choose the schools that fit their values.”

Kennedy Jr on Thursday officially secured a place on the ballot in tightly-contested Michigan.However, some polls point to Kennedy being a bigger threat to Trump in the state that has 15 electoral votes.

Michigan is considered one of seven battleground states that will decide the 2024 presidential election -- along with Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Polls generally show that the presence of independent and third-party candidatesKennedy, Cornel West and Jill Stein provide a small benefit to Donald Trump.

Withmany Democratic electoral cornerstones wobbling-- including blacks, Hispanics and young people -- Blue Team is worried that Kennedy will peel off enough discontented Democrats to deliver victory to Trump. That's whyDemocrats are launching a multi-pronged attack on Kennedy, from legal challenges to his state ballot applications to hosting more than15 Biden-endorsing Kennedy family membersat a Philadelphia event on Thursday.

Democratic worries about Michigan are compounded by what happened in the state's February primary. In a protest of Biden's handling of the Israel-Gaza war,more than 13% of Democrats voted ""uncommitted.""The 100,000 who chose that option represented a block more than 9 times Donald Trump's 2016 victory margin.

However,two recent polls suggest theTrump campaignshould be uneasy about Kennedy's Michigan ballot accomplishment.

With the uncertain Kennedy impact in mind,Trump's Make America Great Again PAC on Monday launched a ""Radical F***ing Kennedy"" website, whichspotlightsvarious Kennedy stances that are anathema to conservatives.

With less than seven months to election day, Michigan is only thesecond statewhere Kennedy is officially on the ballot -- along with Utah. However,Kennedy's campaign and PAC say they've hit the signature requirements in many other states -- including Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina-- and are awaiting the states' validation.

Earlier this week, Kennedy announced that, after having considered the option, hewouldn't pursue the Libertarian Party's nominationas a way of instantly achieving 50-state ballot access.""We're not gonna have any problems getting on the ballot ourselvesso we won't be running Libertarian,"" Kennedy toldABC News. ""We're going to add probably two to three states a week.""

Kennedy won't officially be an independent in the Wolverine State:His name will appear on the ballot line of the obscureNatural Law Party, which was founded to solve political problems ""through alignment with the 'Unified Field' of all the laws of naturethrough the use of the Transcendental Meditation."" Once a fledgling national organization, its last remnants are in Michigan; Ralph Nader ran on the state party's line in 2008. “[Kennedy is] the most qualified candidate in the modern-day history of America,”saidparty chairman Doug Dern.

The director of the FBI has warned that the Chinese state has its sights set on U.S. critical infrastructure to compromise U.S. economic and national security.

Speaking at the Vanderbilt Summit on Modern Conflict and Emerging Threats, Christopher Wraysaid:

“The PRC [People’s Republic of China] has made it clear that it considers every sector that makes our society run as fair game in its bid to dominate on the world stage, and that its plan is to land low blows against civilian infrastructure to try to induce panic and break America’s will to resist.”

The head of the FBI also explained that the Chinese state has taken a hybrid approach to its efforts to weaken the United States, involving cybersecurity, counterintelligence, and crime.

The motivation for these efforts, according to Wray, was“driven by the CCP’s aspirations to wealth and power,” and the desire to “seize economic development in the areas most critical to tomorrow’s economy,” including through illegal means, such as theft.

With regard to critical infrastructure specifically, Wren said “The fact is, the PRC’s targeting of our critical infrastructure is both broad and unrelenting.”

“It’s using that mass, those numbers, to give itself the ability to physically wreak havoc on our critical infrastructure at a time of its choosing,”the head of the FBI also said.

Wray referred to an ongoing hack attack dubbed Volt Typhoon which had opened up access for the hackers to a number of U.S. companies including pipeline operators. China, however, has denied any connection to Volt Typhoon, which Beijing said was a ransomware group, per a Reuters report.

""Some in the US have been using origin-tracing of cyberattacks as a tool to hit and frame China, claiming the US to be the victim while it's the other way round, and politicizing cybersecurity issues,""the Chinese embassy in Washington said, asquotedby Reuters.

2024-04-19 21:00:00,"North Carolina High School Student Suspended Over Use Of ""Illegal Alien""",https://web.archive.org/web/20240420092653/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/north-carolina-high-school-student-suspended-over-use-illegal-alien,"A 16-year-old High School student in North Carolinawas suspended for three days after using the term ""illegal alien""- a legalterm of art, during a vocabulary assignment in his English class.

Leah McGhee, the boy's mother, says her son was assigned vocabulary words during class last Tuesday, which included the word 'alien,' theCarolina Journalreports. When her son asked; ""Like space aliens or illegal aliens without green cards?"" - another student in the class took offense and threatened to kick his ass, prompting the teacher to call in the assistant principal.

School administrators at Central Davidson High School in Lexington deemed his words 'offensive and disrespectful to classmates who are hispanic,' according to the report.

""I didn’t make a statement directed towards anyone; I asked a question,"" the suspended boy said in response to his suspension. ""I wasn’t speaking of hispanics because everyone from other countries needs green cards, and the term “illegal alien” is an actual term that I hear on the news and can find in the dictionary.""

According to the report, the boy's record could now be damaged as he aims to secure an academic scholarship for collage. He currently participates in school clubs, track, and cross country.

""Because of his question, our son was disciplined and given THREE days OUT of school suspension for ‘racism,’"" his mother wrote in an email shared with theJournal. ""He is devastated and concerned that the racism label on his school record will harm his future goal of receiving a track scholarship. We are concerned that he will fall behind in his classes due to being absent for three consecutive days.""

Leah said the assistant principal has so far refused to remove the infraction from her son’s record. The family is working with an attorney to remedy the situation so it doesn’t harm his future, and they expect more developments in the days ahead.

Meanwhile, State Senator Steve Jarvis, R-Davidson, said he contacted the school district’s superintendent to make him aware of the situation. Jarvis told the Carolina Journal that while he informed top officials of the issue and urged officials to look for the best outcome, he did not take a stance on what they should do because he wasn’t there to understand all sides of the story. -Carolina Journal

""I do not see that that would be an offensive statement, just in getting clarification,"" said Sen. Jarvis. ""But there again, I don’t know. I don’t know the situation of this particular incident.""

Seems fairly clear, no?

In a statement toNewsweek, the high school said: ""Please know that Davidson County Schools administrators take all discipline incidents seriously and investigate each one thoroughly,"" adding ""Any violation of the code of conduct is handled appropriately by administrators.""

2024-04-19 21:10:00,"Man Who Self-Immolated Near Trump Trial Was Anti-Fascist, Warned Of ""World Coup"" And Wanted To Start ""F*cking Revolution""",https://web.archive.org/web/20240420092653/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/shocking-video-shows-man-engulfed-flames-outside-trump-trial-nyc,"Update (1710ET):37-year-old Max Azzarello has been identified as the man who set himself on fire near the NYC courthouse where Donald Trump's 'hush money' trial is taking place. He is in critical condition in a burn unit, police said Friday.

Before setting himself on fire, Azzarello dropped a stack of pamphlets that led people to the ""Ponzi Papers"" substack - in which he writes: ""My name is Max Azzarello, and I am an investigative researcher who has set himself on fire outside of the Trump trial in Manhattan.""

Azzarello claims that a totalitarian conspiracy is in play, orchestrated by the U.S. government and its allies,aiming to impose a fascist world order.

This extreme act of protest is to draw attention to an urgent and important discovery:

We are victims of a totalitarian con, and our own government (along with many of their allies) is about to hit us with an apocalyptic fascist world coup.

These claims sound like fantastical conspiracy theory, but they are not. They are proof of conspiracy. If you investigate this mountain of research, you will prove them too. If you learn a great deal about Ponzi schemes, you will discover that our life is a lie. If you follow this story and the links below, you will discover the rotten truth of ‘post-truth America’. You will learn the scariest and stupidest story in world history. And you will realize that we are all in adesperate state of emergency that requires your action.

To my friends and family, witnesses and first responders, I deeply apologize for inflicting this pain upon you. ButI assure you it is a drop in the bucket compared to what our government intends to inflict.

Because these words are true, this is an act of revolution. -The Ponzi Papers

Azzarello's manifesto focuses on the financial sector - particularly around recent banking crises and the role of cryptocurrencies.He suggests that the Silicon Valley Bank run,which was linked to Peter Thiel's actions and the subsequent collapse of Silvergate Bank,was no accident but part of a broader scheme involving cryptocurrencies as a global Ponzi scheme.He claims thatcryptocurrencies were designed to destabilize the economy, implicating major corporations and elites in facilitating this financial upheaval.This scheme, he argues, has contributed to global inflation and is poised to cause even greater economic disruption.

He then expands to politics,alleging that that U.S. government has devolved into a 'secret kleptocracy,' pointing to bipartisan manipulation. According to Azzarello,the government perpetuates division and crisis to maintain controland distract from its exploitative operations. This, he asserts, leads inevitably towards a fascist state unless urgently addressed.

Lastly,he suggests that pop culture such as The Simpsons was designed to normalize dysfunction and distract from critical issues- and that the media is used by the elites in order to manipulate public perception and maintain the status quo that suppresses collective action against systemic injustices.

His solution? A revolution (and, of course, setting himself on fire):

Azzarello was reportedly active in the Anarcho-Communist forum on Reddit,

I've scraped Max Azzarello's Reddit history.Max stated on Reddit he was an Anarcho-Communist.https://t.co/lGYppf7IOPpic.twitter.com/Qe3P9hoZuO

He also took a photograph with former President Bill Clinton.

Latest: A man lit himself on fire outside courthouse where Trump trial underway, NYPD officials brief within hour. CNN team on the ground observed one of the flyers - it said ""NYU is a mob front"" and had various allegations of wrongdoings against the school.

A disturbing video has surfaced on X showing a man setting himself on fire outside the courthouse in Midtown Manhattan where former President Trump's trial is taking place.

The man walked into the park across the street from the courthouse, throwing flyers into the air, a senior law enforcement official told CNN. He then pulled something out of a backpack — it was not immediately clear what the item was — and lit himself on fire, the official said.

The media outlet continued:

Investigators are now fanning out to collect the flyers the unknown man threw into the air, another senior law enforcement official. A CNN team on the ground observed one of the flyers. It said""NYU is a mob front""and had various allegations of wrongdoings against the school.

The video is shocking.

Was he protesting against the trial or for it?

""It seems like Trump Derangement Syndrome is getting out of control,"" X account Planet Of Memes said.

It seems like Trump Derangement Syndrome is getting out of control.

There is the possibility the man could be protesting the Israel-Hamas war as protests have flared up nationwide—still no official report on why the man decided to light himself on fire.

2024-04-19 21:20:00,Speaker Johnson's Ignominious Betrayal,https://web.archive.org/web/20240420092653/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/speaker-johnsons-ignominious-betrayal,"Authored by David Stockman via David Stockman's Contra Corner,

Speaker Johnson’s ignominious betrayal of fiscal sanity might well be the death knell for the GOP. He is apparently risking his speakership on behalf of $95 billion of foreign aid boondoggles that Uncle Sam cannot remotely afford, and which actually provide zero benefit to the homeland security of America. And we do mean zero, as in nothing, nichts, nada, nyet and nugatory, as we amplify below.

What Johnson’s impending Waterloo means, therefore, is not merely the prospect of another wild and wooly succession battle, but actually thatthere is no point at all in the preservation of a Republican majority and GOP House Speaker.After all,the Washington GOP has become so infected with neocon warmongers and careerist polswho spend a lifetime basking in the imperial projects and pretensions of the world’s War Capital that apparently the best the House GOP caucus could do when it ejected the previous careerist deep stater from the Speaker’s chair was to tap the dim-witted nincompoop who currently occupies it.

The Republican party is thus truly beyond redemption.As JFK once said about the CIA, its needs to be splintered into a thousand pieces and swept into the dustbin of history.

Indeed, when you look at the calamitous fiscal trajectory embedded in the CBO’s latest 30-year fiscal outlook,you truly have to wonder about what miniature minds like Congressman Johnson’s are actually thinking.That is to say, the latest CBO report published in March presumes that there will never be another recession and no inflation flare-up, interest rate spike, global energy dislocation, prolonged Forever War or any other imaginable crisis ever again—just smooth economic sailing for the next 30 years.

And yet, and then. Even by the math of this Rosy Scenario on steroids the public debt will reach$140 trillionat minimum by 2054. In turn, that would cause interest payments on the public debt with rates no higher than those which prevailed between 1986 and 1997 to reach$10 trillion per year.

You simply don’t need paragraphs, pages and whole monographs worth of analysis and amplification to understand where that is going. The nation’s fisc is now on the cusp of descending into the maws of a doomsday machine. So how in the world do these elements of Johnson’s offering make even the remotest sense?

Speaker Johnson's Foreign Aid Boondoggle:

Apparently, it’s because Johnson and a good share of the Washington GOP have succumbed wholesale to neocon paranoia, stupidity, lies and hollow excuses for warmongering.For crying out loud,Putin has no interest in molesting the Poles, to say nothing of storming the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. He is certainly no Ghandi, but well more than smart enough to recognize that with Russia’s GDP of $2.2 trillion and war budget of $80 billion there would be no point in going to war with NATO’s $45 trillion of GDP and combined war budgets in excess of $1.2 trillion.

Likewise, China’s $50 trillion debt-ridden Ponzi would collapse in months if its $3.5 trillion flow of export earnings were disrupted after attempting to land its single modern aircraft carrier on the California coast. And Iran has no nukes, no intercontinental range missiles and a GDP equal to 130 hours of US annual output.

So, some Axis of evil!

Yet that’s exactly what the Speaker said this morning after going to too many Deep State briefings and apparently having his own johnson yanked once too often. The Swamp creatures surely see the lad’s naivete and blithering ignorance as a gift that doesn’t stop giving. That is to say, a “mark” who knows nothing at all about the world from sources not stamped, “Top Secret (lies)”.

Speaker Mike Johnson:“We’re going to stand for freedom and make sure that Putin doesn’t march through Europe… we’re the greatest Nation on the planet, and we have to act like it”,

This is a critical time right now, a critical time on the world stage. I can make a selfish decision and do something that’s different but I’m doing here what I believe to be the right thing. “I think providing lethal aid to Ukraine right now is critically important. I really do.I really do believe the intel and the briefings that we've gotten.

I believe Xi, Vladimir Putin and Iran really are an axis of evil.I think they’re in coordination on it. “So I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed. I think he might go to theBalkansnext. I think he might have a showdown with Poland or one of our NATO allies.

To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys. My son is going to begin in the Naval Academy this fall. This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game, this is not a joke.

Needless to say,our dufus Speaker doesn’t know the “Baltics” from the “Balkans”where Serbia and other Russian friendlies are definitely not quaking in their boots about Putin.

In point of fact, however, it is not hard to see that the civil war and territorial dispute between Kiev and Moscow over the Donbas and rim of the Black Sea from Mariupol to Odessa is a one-off of Russian and regional history and Washington’s mindless push of NATO eastward to Russia’s very doorstep.

The light-yellow area of this 1897 map gave an unmistakable message: To wit, in the late Russian Empire there was no doubt as to the paternity of the Donbas and the lands adjacent to the Azov Sea and the Black Sea. Already then, they were part of the 125 years-old New Russia, which had been assembled by purchase and conquest during the reign of Catherine the Great.

Indeed, it was only in 1922 that the yellow area—essentially demarcating the four provinces of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, which recently voted to rejoin Russia—was appended to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic by the great humanitarian and map-maker, V. Lenin.

And yet Speaker Johnson now wants to crash the Republican Party on enforcing a map drawn by one of history’s bloodiest monsters.It’s come down to that.

That is to say, the war in Ukraine would stop tomorrow without another dime of aid from the US taxpayers if Washington agreed to partition the wholly artificial polity assembled by Lenin, Stalin (parts of Poland) and Khruschev (Crimea). In every presidential election in “Ukraine” since 1991 the electorate has essentially voted for separation via 80/20 pluralities in Novorossiya and Crimea for the pro-Russian candidate and 80/20 pluralities in the center and west for the Ukrainian nationalist.

That is,America’s national security would be undermined not one bit by a new map showing two countries and no war: That is, Novorossiya (New Russia) in the east and south, on the one hand, and the parts and pieces of Poland, Galicia-Austria and the Cossack Hetmanates in the center and west, on the other. Agree to keep NATO out of this rump state of Ukraine and it’s all over except the shouting.

Nevertheless,the insanity of the Russophobia which keeps knuckleheads like Johnson from having an even rudimentary grasp of the matter reveals an even larger issue.

Namely, it explains why Washington’s hegemonic foreign policy is a dysfunctional disaster, which unceasingly spawns madness like today’s $95 billion foreign aid boondoggle.

To wit, it encourages the Empire’s client and allied states to take bellicose positions vis a vis Washington designated rivals and enemies because it brings aid to their treasuries, weapons to their militaries and prestige and self-importance to their politicians and diplomats.

Thus,would Poland’s rightwing politicians always be barking at Russia, Russia, Russia in the absence of its NATO membership and US military and diplomatic shield?We sincerely doubt they would be poking the bear, but instead would be seeking friendly accommodation with a natural trading partner.

Likewise with Germany. The latter was apparently so petrified by a rescendant Russia that as recently as 2019 it spent the grand sum of just $50 billion and 1.3% of GDP on defense, while quite logically fueling its booming industrial and export economy with cheap Russian gas.

What has changed since then is not remotely Germany’s assessment of the Russian threat.What changed is client state politics. The Green Party entered the government coalition with the Social Democrats by beating the war-drums because they saw attacking Russia and Russian gas as a way to promote their hideous crusade against fossil fuel. And they did so with impunity, knowing that Washington’s military shield had their backs.

As to Tiawan’s client state politics, it’s not even a close call.Announce that Washington’s archaic “strategic ambiguity” policy– left over from the time of two departed demons, Mao Zedong and Chaing Kai Chek—has now also departed into the “inoperative” realm of Nixon-speak and you wouldn’t need any “Indo-Pacific” aid boondoggles, either.

To the contrary, Taiwan’s leaders would be scampering to Beijing for discussions of a “Hong Kong” transition in short order. America’s homeland security, of course, would be no worse for the wear—except for saving the cost of 100,000 servicemen in the Far East and the multi-trillion cost over time of patrolling the Pacific for the benefit of exactly what?

Then, of course,we get to the $26.4 billion for Israel. That’s about 4.5% of its GDP and should come out of its own war taxes, not Uncle Sam’s credit card. Moreover, it’s proof positive of the baleful impact of the Empire’s military shield and checkbook on client state politics. As we recently showed, Israel’s defense spending has been steadily plunging to less than 5% of GDP, even as its voters have repeatedly elected bellicose governments consisting of rightwing warmongers and fanatical religious factions.

These Netanyahu governments have consistently undermined a two-state solution to the Palestine problem, even going so far as to bless the transfer of billions of cash in suitcases to Hamas in order to undermine the Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority.

Likewise,Netanyahu has wantonly demonized Iran mainly for the purpose of domestic politics and as a means to assemble 60+ vote coalitions in the Knesset.

Absent the US Navy and Air Force shield in the region, however, no Israeli government would have ever conducted unending assassination raids on that country or sabotaged on Capitol Hill Washington’s attempts at constructive arrangements with Iran like Obama’s nuke deal.

Indeed, absent Uncle Sam’s $4 billion annual gift and even more valuable regional military shield, Netanyahu and his extremist coalitions would have needed to raise taxes massively in Israel in order to fund their Garrison State war policies. We doubt the Israeli electorate would have tolerated the true cost of Netanyahu’s madness for very long.

At the end of the day, what Washington now needs is a break-up of the GOP and the formation of a Peace and Freedom party from the remnants of the conservative GOP and the dovish left. Both have been ejected from the UniParty by today’s Republican and Democrat denizens of the world’s War Capital.

So perhaps Johnson’s hari-kari act will bear some fruit,after all. Not as he intended, but in the good way that American democracy desperately needs at this fraught juncture.

Demand for humanoids in factories will likely erupt by the mid-2030s. After that, the commercialization of these robots should drive down prices. This could unlock the potential for these robots infused with AI to work in the service industry or be adopted by households. This is all terrible news for low-skilled, low-wage workers (read:""AI Will Lead To 300 Million Layoffs In The US And Europe""). Before all of this, these robots will be adopted by militaries.

2024-04-19 22:00:00,Breakfast Cereals Scrutinized For Pesticide That May Harm Reproduction,https://web.archive.org/web/20240420092653/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/breakfast-cereals-scrutinized-pesticide-may-harm-reproduction,"Authored by Sina McCullough via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Imagine starting your day with a bowl of cereal that could be silently affecting your family’s health.Recent studies show thatchlormequat, a pesticide linked to reproductive issues, has been found in popular breakfast cereals likeQuaker Oats and Cheerios.As this substance infiltrates the American food supply, the potential risks to our health and future generations loom larger, raising urgent questions about the safety of our everyday food choices.

In astudypublished in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology on Feb. 15, 2024, researchers revealed alarming findings regarding the prevalence of chlormequat.

Chlormequat was detected in the urine of 4 out of 5 people or 80 percent of Americans tested. Additionally, 92 percent of oat-based foods tested contained chlormequat, including Quaker Oats and Cheerios.

This study—the first to report urinary chlormequat measurements in adults living in the United States—highlights the possible widespread presence of chlormequat and the necessity for transparency and further investigation into potential health implications for consumers.

Chlormequat, widely known in the salt form as chlormequat chloride, is an agricultural chemical first registered in the United States in 1962 as a plant growth regulator. Plant growth regulators are chemical substances employed to control and regulate plant growth, flowering, and fruit yield, according to a2006 studyin the International Journal of Andrology.

Chlormequat application in grain crops results in reduced stem height, thereby minimizing the occurrence of lodging (bending over), which can reduce the efficiency of the harvesting process.

Chlormequat is the world’s most common plant growth regulator according to a2020 studypublished in Toxicology. “Chlormequat is often the most detected pesticide residue in grains and cereals, as documented by monitoring surveys spanning several years,” according to the 2024 study. It is approved for use in Europe and parts of North America.

In the United States, chlormequat is permitted exclusively for use on ornamental plants and is prohibited for application on food crops grown within the country. Therefore, the presence of chlormequat in Cheerios and other oat-based foods sold in the United States raises questions regarding its introduction into the food supply chain.

In April 2018 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allowed chlormequat into the food supply by establishing acceptable food tolerance levels for chlormequat chloride in imported oats, wheat, barley, and select animal products. This action allowed for the importation and sale of those agricultural products even if treated with chlormequat.

Consequently,U.S. consumers may unknowingly be ingesting tainted imported foods—potentially exposing themselves to chlormequat or its residues.

In 2020, the allowable chlormequat levels wereincreased for oats. In April of 2023, the EPAproposed allowingthe first-ever use of chlormequat on barley, oat, wheat, and triticale grown in the United States. If passed, exposure levels may increase, raising concerns about its implications on health and food safety.

Chlormequat, while not as notorious as other pesticides, has long been linked to reproductive and developmental concerns in animal research.

In the 1980s, Danish pig farmers observed reproductive declines in pigs consuming chlormequat-treated grains, according to a2006 articlein the International Journal of Andrology.

The observation led to a controlled laboratory study, which confirmed impaired reproduction. Specifically,sows fed chlormequat-treated grain experienced impaired reproduction, primarily disruptions in oestrus cycling, and difficulty mating, as cited in the 2006 article.

These findings prompted the Danish pig industry to recommend restricting the use of crops treated with chlormequat and other growth regulators (up to a maximum of 30 percent of diet energy) due to potential reproductive issues.

Similar findings were observed in 1999 when male mice exposed to chlormequat through food or drinking water demonstrated “significantly diminished fertilization and cleavage rate” of sperm, indicating a decrease in sperm function, according toa studyin Reproductive Toxicology.

Of significance, the estimated intake of chlormequat in the abovementioned pig (0.0023 milligrams (mg)/kilograms (kg) body weight (bw) per day) and mouse (0.024 mg/kg bw/day) experiments fell below the reference dose published by the EPA (0.05 mg/kg bw per day) and the acceptable daily intake published by the European Food Safety Authority (0.04 mg/kg bw/day), according to the 2024 study. These findings raise concerns regarding the current established limits set by regulatory authorities.

Recent studies further demonstrate chlormequat’s reproductive and developmental toxicity, including:

Moreover, developmental toxicity studies suggest that chlormequat exposure during pregnancy can disrupt fetal growth and metabolism postnatally, indicating a lasting impact on offspring development in rats. For instance, a2020 studypublished in Toxicology reported maternal exposure to chlormequat in rats led to adverse effects on postnatal health, including hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperproteinemia seven days after birth compared with controls.

A2007 studyin Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry reported detectable levels of chlormequat in blood, as well as its transfer into milk, in pigs exposed to chlormequat. While these markers have not been thoroughly investigated in humans, they raise concerns regarding potential implications for fetal exposure during pregnancy and infants’ exposure through breastfeeding.

Some studies have failed to detect significant impacts of chlormequat on reproduction infemale miceormale pigs, or the fertilization capacity inmale miceexposed to chlormequat during development and postnatally. The equivocal findings in the toxicological literature concerning chlormequat could stem from variations in tested doses, outcome measures, and/or funding sources. According to a2006 studyin the International Journal of Andrology, “Reports from the industry do not show any effects at these low levels.”

Considering the health concerns underscored in the scientific literature, the goal of the 2024 study was to assess the impact of the EPA’s decision to permit chlormequat in the United States food supply.

The 2024 study assessed chlormequat levels in the urine of individuals from three distinct geographic regions in the United States spanning from 2017 to 2023. Specifically, 21 urine samples were gathered in South Carolina in 2017, 25 samples were collected in Missouri from 2017 to 2022, and 50 samples were obtained in Florida in 2023.

The study also examined chlormequat levels in oat and wheat-based products acquired in the United States during 2022 and 2023. Specifically, 25 conventional oat-based food items were analyzed during this period, along with eight organic oat-based products and nine conventional wheat-based food products.

Chlormequat was detected in 80 percent (77 out of 96) of urine samples.

The authors noted a rising trend in chlormequat exposure over time, with detection frequencies notably elevated in 2023 samples compared to those from 2017 and the years 2018 to 2022. Specifically, in 2017, 69 percent of samples tested positive, while from 2018 to 2022, 74 percent were positive. In stark contrast, 90 percent of samples in 2023 were positive, representing a significant increase compared to all previous years examined.

According to the researchers, “These data indicate likely continuous exposure given the short half-life of chlormequat [2–3 hours].”

To assess whether the rising concentrations detected in the urine samples reflected potential dietary exposure to chlormequat, the researchers analyzed chlormequat levels in oat and wheat-based food products purchased in the United States.

The results of the food analysis were equally concerning: a high percentage of conventional oat-based products tested positive for chlormequat, with popular brands like Quaker Oats and Cheerios among those affected.

Specifically, 92 percent (23 out of 25) of conventional oat-based products tested positive for the presence of chlormequat, “indicating a high prevalence of chlormequat in oats,” according to the study. This highlights the potential risk posed to consumers, particularly children, who may consume these products regularly.

Chlormequat was detected in 12.5 percent (one out of eight) of organic oat-based products tested. Additionally, 22 percent (two out of nine) of conventional wheat-based products tested positive for chlormequat.

Collectively, the urinary and food exposure data “may reflect the likely recent introduction of chlormequat into the U.S. food supply due to EPA regulatory action changes involving chlormequat, including establishing a limit on chlormequat in food in 2018 and raising those limits for oats in 2020,” according to the study.

This groundbreaking study sheds light on the possible widespread prevalence of chlormequat in the United States food supply, as documented in both urinary and food exposure analyses. The findings reveal a concerning trend of increasing chlormequat exposure over time, with detection frequencies spiking notably in recent years.

Chlormequat’s documented toxicological properties, particularly its association with reproductive and developmental issues, raise significant concerns about its long-term effects on human health. Moreover, there is currentlyno monitoringof chlormequat in food products in the United States, leaving consumers vulnerable to potential risks.

With the EPA’s proposed expansion of chlormequat usage on domestically grown crops, the study’s findings serve as a crucial call to action for greater transparency in pesticide usage and monitoring, as well as consumer awareness so we can work toward a food supply that safeguards the well-being of the individual.

2024-04-19 22:20:00,"Housing Costs Are Crushing The American Middle Class, But How Can We Fix The Problem?",https://web.archive.org/web/20240420092653/https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/housing-costs-are-crushing-american-middle-class-how-can-we-fix-problem,"In a new poll conductedby the Financial Timesand Michigan's Ross School of Business, data shows there is a rare bipartisan agreement among Republicans and Democrats – Both sides believe that there are no housing advantages for the their political opponents and 70% of leftists, independents and conservatives alike rate affordability as one of their top three concerns.  In other words, Americans disagree on almost everything else, but they all recognize that most of them are in deep trouble when it comes to keeping a roof over their heads.

It's not just the math, it's the daily drain on people's pocketbooks that makes the problem so undeniable.

While the Biden Administration has spent the better part of the past year claiming that “inflation is going down” the reality has been far more bleak.  Surveys also show that 62% of homeowners has struggled at least periodically in the past year to make their mortgage payments and half of all renters also reported difficulty keeping up with monthly payments.  Over 22% skipped meals, 20% worked extra hours and 20% sold belongings to pay their housing costs on time.

Disturbingly,60% of poll respondentswho make $100,000 or more per year also ranked housing costs at the top of their list of worries going into 2024.  Meaning, the crisis is spreading well beyond low income families and is dragging down the middle class.

Low income, fixed income and middle-income renters are all facing challenges.  The market has become so disjointed that middle-income earners are finding it nearly impossible in most states to find homes in their price range, either to buy or to rent.

The average middle class income is $58,000 to $98,000 annually.  The average yearly cost of a family home rental is $25,000 ($2100 a month and nearly half of a single earner's income on the low end of the middle class average).  This greatly supersedes the common 30% rent rule which suggests that housing should not eat more than 30% of a renter's salary.  In 2019 the average monthly rent for a home was $1400; that's a 50% increase in the span of only four years.

In order to safely afford the monthly median home rental price of $2100, a tenant must make over $6000 after taxes per month.  This cuts more than 50% of the population out of the market.  It's not just the cost of housing, though, there's also a major crisis in availability.

Across the US  there isa shortage of at least 7.2 million homesaffordable and available to renters with extremely low incomes. Extremely low-income renters face a shortage in every state and major metropolitan area.  Middle-income housing is vanishing; known as the “missing middle”, this portion of the market has been bought out and inflated to the point that elasticity in prices has been crushed right along with home buyers and renters.  That is to say, if you make less than six figures then you are quietly and quickly being strangled out of housing access.

But how do we solve this ongoing problem?  Government rent controls won't do anything other than create a larger shortage by scaring property owners out of the rental market.  The Federal Reserve's (supposed) attempts to use higher interest rates to deflate the bubble without triggering consequences to the greater economy have utterly failed.  The conundrum is that the biggest property buyers in the country are supported by the central bank and thus they remain unaffected by higher rates.

These are massive corporate buyers like Blackstone and Black Rock which invest in companies that buy US houses.  Black Rock by extension owns a stake in nearly 7% of the nation's total rental properties.  In 2023 corporate investors accounted for27% of all family home purchases.  Even in the case of house flipping, corporate purchases on a large scale tend to drive up prices for everyone else.

Then there's the issue of illegal immigration which is adding millions of “asylum seekers” every year to the population; all of those people are looking for housing.  With government programs and subsidies helping them they eventually find that housing, allowing them to eat up another piece of the pie.  This leaves legal citizens in the lurch and struggling with low availability.

Finally, there's general inflation.  Building costs for materials and labor have skyrocketed, meaning building new houses might help over many years to stabilize the market but it does not solve the immediate supply crisis and the inflation associated with it.  Americans don't need more expensive houses, they need more affordable houses.

To alleviate the crippled market conditions today would most likely require state imposed moratoriums on corporate home purchases, a moratorium on foreign purchases, not to mention the direct removal of illegal migrants.  Taking action on all three would free up supply and at least give US citizens room to breath by cutting back on their top most expensive necessity.  At bottom things cannot continue the way they have been otherwise the system can and will break under the pressure, leading to even worse economic outcomes.

2024-04-19 22:40:00,NIH Refuses To Release Details Of COVID-19 Vaccine Royalty Agreement,https://web.archive.org/web/20240420092653/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/nih-refuses-release-details-covid-19-vaccine-royalty-agreement,"Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) is refusing to release additional information about an agreement it reached over a COVID-19 vaccine that has earned it at least $400 million.

The NIH declined to provide any materials in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from The Epoch Times.

“The NIH withholds the entirety of the records as they are protected from release,” Gorka Garcia-Malene, an NIH officer, told The Epoch Times in a letter.

She cited an exemption outlined in the act that allows government agencies to partially or fully withhold information.

“In this case, exemption 3 incorporates 35 U.S.C. 209 (f), which reads in relevant part, ‘No Federal agency shall grant any license under a patent or patent application on a federally owned invention unless the person requesting the license has supplied the agency with a plan for development or marketing of the invention, except that any such plan shall be treated by the Federal agency as commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged and confidential and not subject to disclosure under section 552 of title 5,’” Ms. Garcia-Malene wrote.

“Exemption 4 protects from disclosure trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is privileged and confidential,” she added.

In February 2023, Modernaannouncedthat it had paid $400 million to the NIH and would make additional payments in the future as part of a licensing agreement for spike proteins used in the company’s COVID-19 vaccine. The Epoch Timesobtaineda copy of the contract, which confirmed the payment but redacted details of the future payments.

The Epoch Times then lodged a new request, seeking more details about the future payments, which are said to be based on how many COVID-19 vaccines are sold.

Ms. Garcia-Malene was responding to the new request.

James Love, director of the nonprofit Knowledge Ecology International, said the information should be made public.

“The NIH put out several press statements about the royalty dispute with Moderna, and they should not now claim it is some secret confidential information. And when hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake, the public interest in transparency is large too,” Mr. Love told The Epoch Times in an email.

“There are a lot of NIH officials who resent transparency,” he added.

Inquiries to NIH spokespersons received away messages. Another request for comment, sent to one of the addresses provided in the away messages, was not returned.

The Epoch Times plans to appeal the NIH’s decision.

The NIH is one of several government agencies that receive royalty payments. Officials there have fought against attempts to acquire information on these payments, but in 2023, theydisclosedsome $325 million in royalties received between 2009 and 2020 after being sued.

Some experts say the payments, made to the agency and many of its top scientists, should be stopped.

“Neither the government nor any government employee should have any financial interest in a product for which the government has any involvement in licensing or promoting,“ Aaron Siri, managing partner of Siri & Glimstad LLP, told The Epoch Times in an email. ”It creates a dangerous conflict of interest.”

The NIH is trying to obtain more money from COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers, according to recent filings.

BioNTech, Pfizer’s partner, said in the forms that the NIH served it with a notice of default because the NIH’s position is that BioNTech owes it money from COVID-19 vaccine sales.

BioNTech said it does not think it owes the NIH money but that “the ultimate outcome of these matters is uncertain and we cannot guarantee that our interpretation of these license agreements will prevail, or that we will not ultimately need to pay some or all of the royalty and other related amounts in dispute.”

The NIH did not return inquiries on the BioNTech filings.

The NIH has said previously it licensed its spike protein technology to BioNTech for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

The Epoch Times has submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for the notice of default and related documents. Another request seeks information on whether the NIH has threatened or served Pfizer with a similar notice.

However much money the U.S. government receives in royalties will be much less than it has paid for the vaccines. The government has purchased hundreds of millions of shots, spending north of $30 billion.

2024-04-19 23:00:00,Major War Just Narrowly Averted & Biden Already Mulls $1BN+ In New Arms For Israel,https://web.archive.org/web/20240420092653/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/major-war-just-narrowly-averted-biden-already-mulls-1bn-new-arms-israel#comment-stream,"President Biden is mulling his first new major arms sales to Israel since the unprecedented Iranian missile and drone attack which targeted the country last Saturday.

Though the world just narrowly avoided witnessing a major regional war explode with Thursday night's Israeli 'limited' retaliation on the Islamic Republic, the White House apparently thinks the 'answer' is to pump Israel with yet more and more weapons and ammo, to the tune of$1+ billion.

""The Biden administration is considering more than $1 billion in new weapons deals for Israel including tank ammunition, military vehicles and mortar rounds, U.S. officials said, at a time of heightened scrutiny of the use of American-made weapons in the war in Gaza,""Wall Street Journalreports Friday.

""The proposed weapons transfers—which would be in addition to those in a military aid deal currently before the Congress—would be among the largest to Israel since it invaded Gaza in response to Hamas’s attack that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on Oct. 7,"" the report continues.

This also comes while the administration has been talking out of both sides of its mouth - on the one hand condemning the immense civilian death toll in Gaza, and on the other vowing to remain firm in its""ironclad commitment"" to Israel's defense.

The US administration has time and again said it has been urging Israel against escalating with Iran. The White House has also said it did not ""greenlight"" Israel's Thursday overnight attack, which reportedly targeted radar sites in Isfahan, which is home to a key Iranian nuclear facility.

As for the Gaza operation, Biden has still sought to press Israel to hold off on a Rafah ground offensive. And yet, the IDF is more ensconced in the Gaza Strip than ever. There are new reports of anIsraeli military base being established in the heart of Gaza.

""Satellite images and photographs shared on social media show extensive development and construction at two outposts the Israel Defense Forces is building on the strategic road that divides the Gaza Strip into two,"" reportsHaaretz.

""The army calls the construction of these outposts in what it calls the 'Netzarim Corridor' as a long-term achievement. The whole corridor is referred to as something that is here to stay,"" the report indicates.

2024-04-19 23:20:00,"US Fentanyl Crisis Is A 'CCP-Run Operation', Says Peter Schweizer",https://web.archive.org/web/20240420092653/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/us-fentanyl-crisis-ccp-run-operation-says-peter-schweizer#comment-stream,"Authored by Terri Wu and Jan Jekielek via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Three months after the U.S. Department of the Treasurysanctioneda Chinese mafia leader for fentanyl trafficking, he received an award in Beijing.

In March 2021, the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) Overseas United Working Committee recognized Wan Kuok Koi, also known as “Broken Tooth,” as a “patriotic businessman” and the “chief representative” of all international Hongmen associations. Hongmen is synonymous with triads, or Chinese transnational organized crime syndicates, to many Chinese.

The awarding entity is a CCP United Front organization and a platform under the China Association for Science and Technology. It also pushes China’s flagship infrastructure program, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), worldwide.According to the Treasury Department notice, Mr. Wan has established a security company protecting BRI investments in Southeast Asia.

In a recent interview with EpochTV’s American Thought Leaders (ATL), investigative writer Peter Schweizer cited Mr. Wan’s case as an example of the CCP’s take on the United States’ fentanyl crisis.

“The notion that ‘oh, China’s trying very hard, but they can’t fix this’ is an absolute joke in my mind,” he said.

In addition, the author of a new book titled “Blood Money: Why the Powerful Turn a Blind Eye While China Kills Americans” told ATL that the U.S. fentanyl crisis is a “CCP-run operation.”

“The drug cartels are certainly involved, but they’re the junior partner,” Mr. Schweizer said, adding that the CCP is present at “every link of the chain.”

The Chinese production of fentanyl precursors is widely known. However, Mr. Schweizer’s research also shows that China provides pill-pressing machines at cost for fentanyl-laced fake pill production, distributes the synthetic opioid in the United States, facilitates the Mexican drug cartels’ financial transactions, and provides secure communication systems to cartels so they can bypass detection by U.S. law enforcement.

Currently, fentanyl overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 45.The deadly drug was responsible for about 75,000 deaths, or 200 per day, in 2022. Compared with 3,105 deaths in 2013, the death toll increased 23-fold.

Facing this crisis, which has been growing exponentially, the U.S. government has yet to come up with an effective solution. In Mr. Schweizer’s view, U.S. leaders’ inaction is a significant factor.

He documented in his book how senior U.S. leaders, albeit initially voicing concerns about China’s involvement in fentanyl trafficking, have remained largely silent on the issue.

One of those leaders is President Joe Biden.

At a Senate hearing in 1992, the then-chair of the Judiciary Committeewarnedthat “China is poised to become the lynchpin of the heroin trade.”

Then-Sen. Biden also criticized the then-Bush administration’s lack of action on confronting China, saying that “the truth is that the cooperation between the United States and China in fighting drugs is limited, at best, and as is its course, the administration is turning a blind eye to China’s renegade behavior.”

Yet, the Biden administration has been taking a similar approach:toutingits counternarcotics cooperation with China, which relies on voluntary domestic control measures. CCP leader Xi Jinping didn’t keep similar past promises that he made to former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump.

Different than heroin or cocaine, fentanyl takes the lives of people who mostly take the drug unknowingly. A New York University study in 2023showedthat a majority of the people who took fentanyl didn’t intend to do so.

Therefore, Mr. Schweizer thinks calling the fentanyl crisis a drug problem is missing the mark.

To him, it’s “extremely convenient” for the Biden administration to treat fentanyl as a “drug addiction problem, rather than what it is—poisoning,” he said.

“It absolves you of trying to confront the CCP on this because you’re essentially saying this is a human nature problem in the United States.”

In Mr. Schweizer’s view, the first family’s financial ties to China prohibited them from confronting the communists to reign in the Chinese fentanyl actors—a move that could be effective “overnight” if CCP leader Xi Jinping wanted it to be, Mr. Schweizer said.

The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment by press time.

Mr. Schweizer’s findings don’t stop at the fentanyl crisis, which he sees as a part of the CCP’s broader approach of “disintegration warfare,” aimed at bringing down the United States by attacking its “soft underbelly” regarding Americans’ politics, economics, and psychology.

In the ATL interview, he also talked about the CCP’s links to activities that sow social discord by inflaming racial and gender divisions in U.S. society and “dumbing down the West” with TikTok.

The interview premieres on April 18.

..but some saw it coming.

In a week characterized bydata supporting 'no landing' from a growth perspective and disappointment from a disinflation perspective...

FedSpeak that was without exception - hawkish!

As they suddenly realized that all that 'pivot' optimism did nothing but dramatically ease financial conditions and fuck their 'best laid plans' for a rate-cut and soft landing...

Even the dove-est of the doves - Austan Goolsbee - bent the knee today:

“So far in 2024, that progress on inflation has stalled,”Goolsbee said Friday in remarks prepared for an event in Chicago.

“You never want to make too much of any one month’s data, especially inflation, which is a noisy series, but after three months of this, it can’t be dismissed.”

“Right now, it makes sense to wait and get more clarity before moving,”Goolsbee said.

And sure enough, rate-cut expectations for 2024 and 2025 have both plunged this week...

...and that has finally started to weigh on investors' risk appetites (that's a long way to catch down to reality)...

Most traders thought the worst was over last night as the panic-puke in futures was BTFD'd back to unchanged ahead of the cash open, but then the selling started (on Nasdaq) and never really stopped. On the day, Nasdaq was down over 2% while The Dow managed to gain 0.5%. Small Caps were almost unchanged by the end of the day with the S&P lagging...

But, all the majors ended the week red (with The Dow desperately trying to get back to even). Nasdaq was down over 5.5% on the week! S&P and Small Caps down around 3%...

Nasdaq is down for six straight days for its biggest weekly drop since Nov 2022, breaking below its 100DMA as CTA 'sell threshold's were crosed. Goldman's trading desk noted:

""The NDX now pacing for its worst week in over a year (down 6 of 7 weeks) as a complicated technical backdrop(CTAs, lower retail participation, NDX now testing 100-dma, seasonality), sideways earnings revisions thus far (ASML, TSM and even Sheridan’s NFLX EPS revisions were only 1-2% last night),a tense geopolitical backdrop (overnight headlines) and elevated positioning are testing conviction into a busy week of earnings… some debate if this all ‘helps’ the set-up into FAAMG prints or if the market is just read to ‘take a breather’ and sell any good news...""

The MAG7 basket broke below its 50DMA this week- the first time since October, when The Fed 'pivoted' and save the world.The market cap of the MAG7 is now down over $1 Trillion from its highs a week ago...

AI Leaders crashedrelative to firms 'at risk from AI', plunging to their lowest in two months...

Of note is that the AI Leaders are perfectly back to their prior peak in 2021 (which was driven by chip demand for crypto mining and COVID disruptions), breaking down to the 100DMA and through the medium-term uptrend...

Semis were slaughtered this week...

NVDA plunged 10% today back to two month lows, closing below its 50DMA for the first time since Nov 2023...

... now in bear market (down over 22% from its highs) and the CSCO analog doesn't look so crazy anymore...

Interestingly, amid all this carnage, banks had a decent week with WFC and MS outperforming (JPM still lagging from its drop on last Friday's earnings)...

The Russell 2000, Nasdaq, and Dow are all back below their 100DMA, and the S&P 500 is pushing down towards its 100DMA (having blow thru the CTA 'sell' thresholds)...

Goldman's trading desk warns, it could get worse:""CTA supply is building – our team’s work shows this group sold $25B globally this week ($9B in SPX) with next week expected to bring another $27B globally(and $10B SPX) in a flat tape scenario.  Reminder the medium term threshold (aka most important) level is 4886 – less than 100 handles away from spot.""

Next week brings43% of SPX set to report earningshighlighted byMETA/MSFT/GOOGL (aka $6.1T of mkt cap) reporting on Thurs night...on the macro front, key reports include1Q GDP on Thurs & March PCE on Fri.

VIX soared this week to six-month highs, and credit markets also - finally - started to crack...

Treasury yields ended the week higher, but not before plunging overnight on  a flight-to-quality bid as Israeli missiles hit Iran, taking yields lower on the week. By the close of the week, the belly slightly underperformed but yields were all up by around 8-10bps....

The dollar rallied for the second straight week, hitting its highest since early Nov 2023 last night on the mid-east attacks before sliding back...

Heading into today's 'halving' - likely to occur within the next few hours - Bitcoin was down, puking once again overnight on geopolitical chaos like it did last weekend, only to see buying come right back (after testing below $60,000 for the first time since early March)...

5.00% remains a key level for the 2Y Yield...

Despite two major attacks in the Middle East,oil prices ended lower for the second week in a row(well WW3 hasn't started yet). Some knock-on effects from an evaporation of hope for demand-sponsoring rate-cuts also weighed on sentiment as WTI

Spot Gold prices spiked overnight on the Israel attack, pulled back, then rallied up to $2400 once again to close at the highs...

Gold closed the week at a new record high...

Silver soared 3% on the week to new cycle highs (its highest since Feb 2021)...

Silver has been broadly speaking outperforming gold in recent weeksafter peaking at a gold-to-silver ratio of around 92x in January, it is ow down to 83 (still well above the 65x average since 1980... implying silver remains 'cheap' to gold)...

...and then there's Cocoa...

And finally, are bank reserves at The Fed still the driving force for reality?

We saw the reality check from Aug-Oct last year; are we about to get another?

2024-04-20 12:15:00,Bill Maher Calls Out Hollywood Pedophilia And The Gay Agenda In Schools,https://web.archive.org/web/20240421105615/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/bill-maher-calls-out-hollywood-pedophilia-and-gay-agenda-schools,"It's not the easiest thing for a person to step away from their peer group and question the dogmatic political path the mob has chosen to follow.  When it comes to the woke left, stepping out of line is doubly difficult because any deviation from the approved ideology usually means immediate cancellation and excommunication (one's career is in danger).  Only a few years ago it would have been unheard of for a mainstream celebrity to break from the progressive pack and speak publicly about inconvenient truths.  Those few that did were quickly blacklisted.

Consider the bizarre leftist war on Star Wars actress Gina Carano, who expressed conservative views on the trans issue and was told she had to participate in a company sponsored Zoom struggle session.  The message was clear:  She was expected to sublimate herself in front of a crowd of45 finger-wagging LGBT peoplein order to make amends.  When she refused and continued defending her personal conservative ideals online, she was made an example of and cast out of Hollywood.

Bill Maher is, if anything, clever about his timing like most comedians.  His rebellion against the woke mob has been carefully crafted in a way that has allowed him to avoid outright cancellation.  It's not as impressive a revolt as Gina Carano's because the risk today is far less, but at least he's willing to address the obvious hypocrisy within the social justice crowd and admit that maybe, just maybe, conservatives had it right all along.

His latest surprising monologue covers an issue everyone has known about for years but almost no one in the media has been willing to address seriously because it involves many of their friends in the entertainment industry.  Hollywood was quick to jump on the feminist bandwagon at the helm of the ""Me Too Movement"", but this only exposed a small part of Hollywood's degeneracy.  Actresses trading sex for favors from producers and executives is hardly that shocking a revelation.  The thing they really don't want to talk about is the industry's penchant for pedophilia...

It turns out for pedophiles in Hollywood, ""It's A Small World After All.""pic.twitter.com/4qUtOhXZYL

One of the deepest darkest secrets of film, television and music media is that the business has long been used as a vehicle for child abusers to target kids in an environment where parental supervision is limited (and lots of money can be gained).  This reminds us of yet another environment where parental supervision is limited:  Public schools.  The political left has also targeted these institutions as ample ground for grooming.  Why?  As Bill Maher notes, the groomers are naturally gravitating to where the children are.

""Leave the kids alone"" is a mantra that the woke movement simply refuses to understand or accept.  The reason is relatively transparent - Leftists are less inclined to have children of their own, and so, in order to increase their numbers and power they are required to indoctrinate your kids instead.  This is all done under the guise of ""inclusion"" and the ""greater good"" but the results of this kind of activism are becoming deeply disturbing.  Even moderate liberals are noticing that woke behavior is destroying what remains of their image.

It may be that people like Bill Maher are finally realizing that progressive extremism is opening the door to a Trump win in November and they are in a panic to pull their compatriots back from the brink.  Most of the world hates woke activists with a passion and they just want to go back to the days when race and sexuality were not at the center of every single discussion, whether it be in movies or in the classroom.  Progressives have become so drunk with power after receiving the backing of governments and corporations that they flew too close to the sun; now they are getting roasted in the flames of public distrust.

Bitcoin had its fourth halving yesterday, and the first one to take place on a Friday night! Perfect timing for parties. This was its fourth successful monetary policy adjustment, this time halving issuance from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block. If only monetary policy were this elegant at the Federal Reserve. Nik and I would be out of a job, there’d be nothing to talk about.

The biggest news of the night has got to be the unbelievably large block reward associated with block 840,000 and beyond. For reference, here’s a typical clock roughly 3.5 hours before the halving took place, with about a 7 BTC block reward, currently worth around $450,000:

Block 840,000, the block that ushered in bitcoin’s fourth supply schedule reduction, had an eyewatering40.7 BTC block reward, worth some $2.6 million.Total rewards for the halving block quintupled their norm thanks to insane transaction fees:

Why did this happen? And why have blocks since 840,000 had similarly huge transaction fees and a massive total reward? A new token protocol went live on block 840,000 that uses OP_RETURN called Runes, used for inscriptions that have no explicit monetary association with BTC itself—reminiscent of other crypto pump and dumps.

The good news is that plenty of people who tried to mint their tokens in block 840,000lost thousands of dollarsdue to their transaction being accepted by one mining pool but not making it into others, or minting a Rune and having it sell out before their transaction was confirmed. Said more simply, non-BTC activity clogged up the blockchain. Hundreds of bitcoin were paid to mint and buy Runes within just the first 10 post-halving blocks. Though it’s a game of greater fools in which essentially everybody loses, it does detract from block space and accentuate the need for hastening the development of and further expansion of liquidity on layer 2 scaling solutions like the Lightning Network.

Transaction fees a percentage of the total block reward jumped to their highest level ever of 75%, a preview of what’s to come in bitcoin mining economics decades from now as bitcoin monetizes into a $10-trillion+ asset, demand for the network is orders of magnitude larger than today, and we’ve had a few more halvings:

2024-04-20 13:25:00,"Israeli Security Chief Slams 'Lame' Attack On Iran, Deepening Division Among War Leaders",https://web.archive.org/web/20240421105615/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/israeli-security-chief-slams-lame-attack-iran-deepening-division-among-war-leaders,"Days ago,The Wall Street Journalfeatured a headline that underscoredIsrael's war leaders don't trust one another. This comes as they are dealing simultaneously with the operation in Gaza, repelling Hezbollah daily drone and missile attacks in the north, and of course the new tit-for-tat crisis with Iran.

""Long-simmering grudges and arguments over how best to fight Hamas have soured relations between Israel’s wartime decision makers—Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and the former head of the Israeli military, Benny Gantz,"" thepublication wrote. ""The three men are at odds over the biggest decisions they need to make: how to launch a decisive military push, free Israel’s hostages and govern the postwar strip.""

Israel's former national security adviser Giora Eiland said ""The lack of trust between these three people is so clear and so significant."" But the deep mistrust goes beyond the three wartime leaders and deeper into the governing coalition and national security cabinet as well.

The infighting is now on display even more in the wake of Israel's retaliatory attack on Iran which took place in the early morning Friday hours. While there's consensus that Israel aimed for a 'limited' attack,CNNand others have analyzed satellite images near Isfahan which ultimately show ""no extensive damageon an Iranian airbase believed to be the main target.""

Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir has thrown fresh fuel to the fire, mocking Netanyahu's decision-making by calling it""lame"". Ben Gvir had previously wanted Israel to ""go berserk"" in retaliation.

His words have once again resulted in intense controversy andinfighting:

Ben Gvir, who leads the ultranationalist Jewish Power party, made aone-word poston X following the Israeli attack. Written in Hebrew, the Telegraphexplainedthat the post useda “slang word that literally translates as ‘scarecrow’ but also means ‘lame.’”Reuterstranslated the word to “feeble.”

The post highlighted a public rift within the government in Tel Aviv. Ben Gvir is considered on the extreme end of Israel’s political spectrum and is popular among the right-wing settler movement. He lives in a West Bank settlement and has called for the resettlement of Gaza by Israelis.

Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid subsequently blasted Ben Gvir over the comment, saying: ""Never before has a minister in the security cabinet done such heavy damage to the country’s security, its image and its international status.""

""In anunforgivable one-word tweet, Ben Gvir managed to mock and shame Israel from Tehran to Washington. Any other prime minister would have thrown him out of the cabinet this morning,"" he added.

Meanwhile, PM Netanyahu continues to face mounting calls for his removal, especially from hostage victims' families who have been leading large protests. They are outraged that he has not prioritized getting the hostages back.

WSJ wrote further that ""Gantz, the general who led Israel’s last major war against Hamas a decade ago, has previouslyexpressed a desire to oust Netanyahu as prime minister."" The defense chief had ""called earlier this month for early elections in September after tens of thousands of people demonstrated against the prime minister’s handling of the war—a sign that Gantz’s base has grown frustrated with his role in a Netanyahu-led government.""

2024-04-20 14:00:00,NPR Scandal Should Kill Taxpayer-Funded Broadcasting,https://web.archive.org/web/20240421105615/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/npr-scandal-should-kill-taxpayer-funded-broadcasting#comment-stream,"Authored by Charles Lipson via RealClearPolitics,

“I don't want any yes-men around me,” said Sam Goldwyn, the Hollywood producer famed for his movies and malapropisms. “I want everybody to tell me the truth even if it costs them their job.” The brass at National Public Radio must have heard Sam, but they add a slight amendment. We want only “yes-men” (they/them) and will boot anyone who dares to dissent.

Lest there be any doubt, NPR just proved it by suspending, without pay, the staffer who exposed the pervasive problems there.He dared to write publicly that that NationalPublicRadio was uniformly ideological, deeply committed to its strident left-wing views, and determined to exclude any alternatives. For saying that out loud,they cut off Uri Berliner’s paycheck for five days. It’s their way of saying, “Thank you for your feedback.” Q.E.D.

Berliner, disgusted by NPR’s response, resigned Wednesday with a fiery statement:“I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged.”Who could?

There are really two problems here, not one, and they go well beyond one journalist’s resignation. The first is political bias, which is a problem at all “elite” networks and newspapers, where “hard news” is heavily slanted. The second is that some of these outlets, notably NPR, PBS (the Public Broadcasting System) and their local affiliates, receive taxpayer funding.

Let’s take political bias first. It was once a cardinal rule of journalism that partisan or ideological viewpoints should be confined to editorials and opinion columns. The goal was to keep editorial views out of hard-news reporting, as much as possible. To do it, the editorial staff constantly fought with the business team, who wanted coverage to favor their advertisers.

Those days are long gone and so is even the ideal of unbiased coverage.We have returned to an earlier era when American newspapers were closely affiliated with political parties and local political machines and covered the news to favor them. Today’s newsrooms have revived that stance. They are as ideologically driven as a gender-studies class at Smith College. If you depart from that ideology, you are out, like Bari Weiss at the New York Times.

Because newsrooms now have so few dissenting voices, reporters and editors live inside the bubble and hardly notice their surroundings.If they do, they are determined to preserve that insularity.

The fragmentation of today’s media landscape encourages these strong, partisan stances. Newspapers, magazines, cable networks, and podcasts know the market is finely sliced. They have strong incentives to choose a narrow slice for themselves and appeal to it by confirming their audience’s bias, not challenging it. That’s as true for right-wing talk radio as it is for left-wing public radio.

Just as elite attitudes have moved further left, so have elite publications and broadcasts. Since the Democratic Party has trod that same path, even as Republicans have become more nationalist and populist, the bias in elite newsrooms has naturally moved further left. That includes outlets like NPR and PBS. Their audience drives EVs, not Ford F-150s.

What makes this bias a policy issue is that NPR, PBS, and their local outlets receive taxpayer money. They shouldn’t. It was justifiable for educational programming. It cannot be justified for news or entertainment.

Public funding for news programming is fundamentally wrong in a democracy when there are so many other ways to receive news and information.The problem is compounded when taxpayer money pays for coverage is partisan and biased. That’s not an issue for MSNBC or the New York Times. They are private businesses. They can do whatever they damn well please. Not so for NPR, PBS, and their local affiliates. Theydoreceive taxpayer money.

When NPR faced criticism this week, it shot back with deceptive statistics, claiming less than 1% of its money is from the government. That’s three-card-monte accounting.

To understand why, we need to look at how Washington disburses taxpayer money for public TV and radio, some $500 million in the next fiscal year. That money doesn’t go directly to NPR. (Hence, the 1% claim.) They get it indirectly. First, the federal outlay goes to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private entity, as mandated in a 1967 law.The CPB sends nearly all that money to local public radio and TV stations as “community grants.”The stations then use part of that money to buy syndicated programs like NPR’s “Morning Edition” and “All Things Considered.”

NPR last financial statementshowed that about one-third of its revenue came from local stations’ purchasing NPR programs. A significant chunk of the money to make those purchases came from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. To hide that source of taxpayer funding for NPR was its three-card-monte trick.

The larger problem here is not the deception or partisan bias, bad as they are. It’s not the scale of public funding, either. The fundamental problem is that taxpayers should not be underwriting any domestic news organizations, for any amount. Reporting should be completely independent of city, state, and federal government so journalists can report political issues without fear or favor.

Government-funded broadcasting to foreign audiences is different. American taxpayers have legitimate reasons to fund the Voice of America and other channels, primarily to get honest news past the dictators’ censors. Butthe VOA is prohibited, by law, from broadcasting within the United States or creating programs for U.S. audiences. That’s entirely proper. The same logic should apply to news and news-interview programs from NPR and PBS and their local affiliates.

What about “educational TV”?There were good reasons for a publicly funded network devoted to that mission in the 1950s and 1960s. There were only three major networks and, of course, a genuine need for educational content. That non-political service lasted from 1954 until 1970. It was succeeded by the Public Broadcasting Service, which quickly dropped any mention of “educational.” Member stations of the old National Educational Television were folded into PBS.Their schedules now include a mix of entertainment, educational programs, news, and news interviews.

National Public Radio, by contrast, has never included much educational content. For years, it has been simply a left-wing alternative to right-wing talk radio. That would be fine only if all the funding were private. It’s not.

The evidence shows that the best educational TV, such as “Sesame Street,” does help children learn.So there are good reasons to continue underwriting such programs. Ideally, they should be provided free to anyone who wishes to broadcast them, post them on the web, or use them in class.

But there is no reason for federal, state, or city governments to own any broadcast channel, other than to broadcast public meetings and hearings. For everything else, including educational programs, there are countless channels on cable TV and YouTube.

A good example of what the government can properly fund are the wonderfulvideos about scientific discoveries, presented in accessible language by Fermilab’s Dr. Don Lincoln. The lab is funded by the government, and Dr. Lincoln conveys its work to the public by posting brief lectures on the web. He is doing what “educational TV” did in the 1950s. In the 2020s, programs like Dr. Lincoln’s can be posted online for the public to use, free. We don’t need public TV or radio to do it, and we don’t need their publicly funded podcasts.

If private institutions want to publish their own educational videos, either free or for sale, the world is open to them.Let “the Great Courses” do that by selling them online. Let “Prager University” do it. Let MIT broadcast its science courses. Let a million podcasts bloom. Privately.

If the federal government wishes to fund genuinely educational content, fine. It’s also fine to provide public services like weather information, which taxpayers already fund. But if the federal government, cities, or states wish to fund news and news interview programs, that’s not fine. Let private entities do it. Exclusively.

What should be done with existing public broadcasting frequencies on radio and television?Put them up for auction and put the money into the public treasury. If civic groups or philanthropies buy them, fine. If commercial enterprises buy them, that’s fine, too. The Department of Education can still fund education programs and make the content available to anyone who wishes to use it or broadcast on their channels.$500 million should buy a lot of new content each year.

What the government should not fund, produce, or broadcast are news or news-interview programs. The issue is not just political bias. The issue is that the heavy hand of government should not control any broadcast news within the U.S. Let the president, Cabinet secretaries, senators, and representatives hold press conferences. Let the White House, Pentagon, or State Department hold briefings. That’s more than enough to get their message out.

They don’t need to fund broadcast networks. That would be true even if their journalists and presentations were fair-minded. They aren’t, and that’s one more reason to end this public funding. But it is not the main reason. The main reason is that it is simply wrong for the government, with its deep pockets and coercive power, to control any broadcast network. Not in a free country.

In total, the foreign assistance package totals $95 billion - which only passedafter Speaker Mike Johnson cut a deal with Democratsin order to force it through by a vote of 311 to 112.

The Senate is expected to pass the package, which was negotiated in conjunction with the White House, marking a victory against conservative lawmakers who insisted on protecting the US border before sending money abroad to protect those of other countries.

“We cannot be afraid of our shadows. We must be strong. We have to do what’s right,” House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said.

Democrats and some Republicans waved Ukrainian flags during the vote, a rare moment of bipartisanship in a bitterly and narrowly divided House.

“Traditional House Republicans led by Speaker Mike Johnson have risen to the occasion,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said. “We have a responsibility to push back against authoritarianism.” -Bloomberg

Earlier in the day, the House passed an $8 billion aid package aimed at countering Chinese aggression towards Taiwan, as well as a bill that would force Chinese-controlled ByteDance Ltd to divest from TikTok or face a US ban.The bill also allows for the confiscation of Russian dollar assetsin order to help fund more assistance to Ukraine.

Speaker Johnson made it essentially impossible to vote for any of the bills before the House today without assisting in the effort to send $60 billion to Ukraine and up to $9 billion to Hamas.He also made it impossible to condition any of those things on U.S. border security.

Breaking down the Ukraine aid - of the $61 billion, $13 billion will replenish US stockpiles of weapons, and $14 billion will go towards US defense systems for Ukraine. $7 billion will go toward US military operations in the region. We assume the remainder will go directly to Ukrainian oligarchs.

The Israel bill, which passed by a vote of 366 to 58, includes$4 billion for missile defense.

Notably absent wasso much as adimefor the US border...

""Nothing is done to secure our border or reduce our debt,"" said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), whose outrage was shared with Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who say they're ready to boot Johnson from his Speakership.

""Ukraine is not even a member of NATO,"" Greene continued.

2024-04-20 14:55:00,Not 'The Onion': New Guinea Academics Say Cannibals Would Be Offended By Biden's Tale Of Uncle Being Eaten,https://web.archive.org/web/20240421105615/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/not-onion-new-guinea-academics-say-cannibals-would-be-offended-bidens-tale-uncle-being#comment-stream,"Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news,

Academics from Papua New Guinea say that the actual cannibals who live there would be extremely offended by Joe Biden’s made up story of his uncle being eaten by them during World War Two because they “wouldn’t just eat any white men that fell from the sky.”

As we highlighted earlier this week, Biden twice told the completely made up story as a way of attacking Donald Trump.

In reality his uncle wasn’t a reconnaissance pilot, wasn’t shot down over Papua New Guinea and definitely wasn’t eaten by cannibals.

It didn’t prevent the White House Press Secretary from calling doing her best to avoid admitting it was all lies, andcalling it a “very proud” moment for Biden, before repeating the lie about Trump calling dead US veterans ‘losers’.

Press Secretary does her best to avoid admitting that Biden’s story about his uncle being shot down and eaten by cannibals was total made up horse shit. Then repeats the lie that Trump called fallen veterans ‘losers’pic.twitter.com/Kl9sv4sDMf

The story gets more ridiculous, however.

The Guardian nowreportsthatoutraged Papua New Guinea academics have blasted Biden’s tale as “unacceptable” and “very offensive.”

‘Lost for words’: Joe Biden’s tale about cannibals bemuses Papua New Guinea residentshttps://t.co/bYFg7KAgg5

Michael Kabuni, a political science lecturer at the University of Papua New Guinea, explained that cannibalism was historically practiced by some communities only in very specific contexts, such as after the death of a revered community member.

Kabuni noted that the native people only ever engaged in cannibalism as a sign of respect and thatlocals “wouldn’t just eat any white men that fell from the sky.”

“Taking it out of context, and implying that your [uncle] jumps out of the plane and somehow we think it’s a good meal is unacceptable,”Kabuni urged.

Allan Bird, governor of Papua New Guinea’s province of East Sepik, said hefound Biden’s story “hilarious” and was “lost for words.”

Tesla announced on Monday that it is cutting over 10% of its 140,000-strong global workforce to prepare for a new phase of growth,according to CNBC.

Details on the layoffs were sparse, but in a company memo, Elon Musk said the move was part of a strategic shift towards robotaxi development, stepping away from plans for a more affordable electric vehicle.

Musk wrote in an email last week:“As we reorganize Tesla it has come to my attention that some severance packages are incorrectly low. My apologies for this mistake. It is being corrected immediately.”

Nico Murillo, a former production supervisor, toldBloomberg:“Tried to badge in, and the security guard took my badge and told me I was laid off. Sat in my car in disbelief.”

Aswe've noted, Tesla missed its Q1 delivery guidance and, so far in 2024, its stock has been decimated. For Q1 2024, Tesla produced over 433,000 vehicles and delivered 387,000. It marks the first annual Q1 delivery decline for the automaker since 2020.

Tesla's exact delivery number for the quarter was 386,810 vehicles, far below Bloomberg estimates of 449.080.

Tesla submitted a proxy statement for its June 13 shareholder meeting this week, requesting shareholders to approve relocating the company's state of incorporation to Texas and to ratify CEO Elon Musk's 2018 pay package, which was recently rescinded by a Delaware judge.

In the statement, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm supports the move to Texas, noting that the company has been headquartered there since December 2021., perYahoo.

“2024 is the year that Tesla should move home to Texas. We are asking for your vote to approve Tesla’s move from Delaware, our current state of incorporation, to a new legal home in Texas. Texas is already our business home, and we are committed to it,”  Denholm said.

“In 2018, we asked for unbelievable growth and accomplishments. Elon delivered: Tesla’s stockholders have benefited from unprecedented growth under Elon’s leadership and Tesla has met every single one of the 2018 CEO pay package’s targets,” she continued.

Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush added: “On the comp package which was already approved by shareholders at the time in 2018, this has been an area of contention among some investors but we would expect the 2018 package will be reapproved and the Delaware court ruling would be moot in essence as Tesla will now be moving to Texas.”

2024-04-20 16:05:00,What Are Mises' Six Lessons?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240421105615/https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/what-are-mises-six-lessons#comment-stream,"Authored by Jonathan Newman via The Mises Institute,

Ludwig von Mises’sEconomic Policy: Thoughts for Today and Tomorrowhas become quitepopularrecently. The Mises Book Store has sold out of its physical copies, and the PDF, which isavailable online for free, has seen over 50,000 downloads in the past few days.

This surge in interest in Mises’s ideas was started by UFC fighter Renato Moicano, whodeclaredin a short post-fight victory speech,“I love America, I love the Constitution...I want to carry...guns. I love private property. Let me tell you something. If you care about your...country, read Ludwig von Mises and the six lessons of the Austrian economic school.”

The “six lessons” he is referring to is Mises’s book,Economic Policy: Thoughts for Today and Tomorrow, which was republished by our friends in Brazil under the title “As Seis Lições” (“The Six Lessons”).

If you are interested in what Mises has to say in this book, which is a transcription of lectures he gave in Argentina in 1959, here’s a brief preview, which I hope inspires you to read the short book in full. As a side note, if you are an undergraduate student who is interested in these ideas, the Mises Institute’s nextMises Book Clubis on this text (pure coincidence!).

Mises begins his first lecture with an overview of the development of capitalism out of feudalism. Businesses began “mass production to satisfy the needs of the masses” instead of focusing on producing luxury goods for the elite. These big businesses succeeded because they served the needs of a larger group of people, and their success wholly depended on their ability to give this mass of consumers what they wanted.

Despite the amazing and undeniable increases in standards of living, even for a growing population, capitalism had its detractors, including Karl Marx, who gave capitalism its name. Mises says that while Marx hated capitalism and that Marx dubbed it thusly as an attack on the system, the name is a good one

because it describes clearly the source of the great social improvements brought about by capitalism. Those improvements are the result of capital accumulation; they are based on the fact that people as a rule, do not consume everything they have produced, that they save—and invest—a part of it.

Prosperity is the result of providing for the future—more precisely it is the result of setting aside consumption today by saving and investing resources in production. Mises says that this principle explains why some countries are more prosperous than others. When it comes to economic growth, “there are no miracles.” There is only “the application of the principles of the free market economy, of the methods of capitalism.”

In the second lecture, Mises takes a closer look at Marx’s proposed system: socialism. Economic freedom means that people can choose their own careers and use their resources to accomplish their own ends. Economic freedom is the basis for all other freedoms. For example, when the government seizes whole industries, like that of the printing press, it determines what will be published and what won’t and the “freedom of the press disappears.”

Mises acknowledges that there is no such thing as “perfect freedom” in a metaphysical sense. We must obey the laws of nature, especially if we intend to use and transform nature according to our ends. And even economic freedom means that there is a fundamental interdependence among individuals: “Freedom in society means that a man depends as much on other people as other people depend upon him.” This is also true for big businesses and the entrepreneurs who lead them. The true “bosses” in the market economy are not those who shout orders to the workers, but the consumers.

Socialists despise the idea of consumer sovereignty because it means allowing mistakes. In their mind, the state should play the paternalistic role of deciding what is good for everyone. Thus Mises sees no difference between socialism and a system of slavery: “The slave must do what his superior orders him to do, but the free citizen—and this is what freedom means—is in a position to choose his own way of life.” In capitalism, this freedom makes it possible for people to be born into poverty but then achieve great success as they provide for their fellow man. This kind of social mobility is impossible under systems like feudalism and socialism.

Mises ends this lecture with a short explanation of the economic calculation critique of socialism. When the private ownership of the means of production is prohibited, then economic calculation is made impossible. Without market prices for factors, we cannot economize production and provide for the needs of the masses, no matter who oversees the socialist planning board. The result is mass deprivation and chaos.

Interventionism describes a situation in which the government “wants to interfere with market phenomena.” Each intervention involves an abrogation of the consumer sovereignty Mises had explained in the two previous lectures.

The government wants to interfere in order to force businessmen to conduct their affairs in a different way than they would have chosen if they had obeyed only the consumers. Thus, all the measures of interventionism by the government are directed toward restricting the supremacy of consumers.

Mises gives an example of a price ceiling on milk. While those who enact such an intervention may intend to make milk more affordable for poorer families, there are many unintended consequences: increased demand, decreased supply, non-price rationing in the form of long queues at shops that sell milk, and, importantly, grounds for the government to intervene in new ways now that their initial intervention has not achieved its intended purpose. So, in Mises’s example, he traces through the new interventions, like government rationing, price controls for cattle food, price controls for luxury goods, and so on until the government has intervened in virtually every part of the economy, i.e., socialism.

After providing some historical examples of this process, Mises gives the big picture. Interventionism, as a “middle-of-the-road policy,” is actually a road toward totalitarianism.

There can be no secret way to the solution of the financial problems of a government; if it needs money, it has to obtain the money by taxing its citizens (or, under special conditions, by borrowing it from people who have the money). But many governments, we can even say most governments, think there is another method for getting the needed money; simply to print it.

If the government taxes citizens to build a new hospital, then the citizens are forced to reduce their spending and the government “replaces” their spending with its own. If, however, the government uses newly printed money to finance the construction of the hospital, then there is no replacement of spending, but an addition, and “prices will tend to go up.”

Mises, per usual, explodes the idea of a “price level” that rises and falls, as if all prices change simultaneously and proportionally. Instead, prices rise “step by step.” The first receivers of new money increase their demands for goods, which provides new income to those who sell those goods. Those sellers may now increase their demands for goods. This explains the process by which some prices and some people’s incomes increase before others. The result is a “price revolution,” in which prices and incomes rise in a stepwise fashion, starting with the origin of the new money. In this way, new money alters the distribution of incomes and the arrangement of real resources throughout the economy, creating “winners” and “losers.”

The gold standard offers a strict check against the inflationist tendencies of governments. In such a system, the government cannot create new units of money to finance its spending, so it must resort to taxation, which is notably unpopular. Fiat inflation, however, is subtle and its effects are complex and delayed, which makes it especially attractive to governments that can wield it.

In this lecture Mises also executes a thorough smackdown of Keynes and Keynesianism, but I’ll leave that for readers to enjoy.

Mises returns to a principle he introduced in the first lecture, that economic growth stems from capital accumulation. The differences in standards of living between countries is not attributable to technology, the qualities of the workers, or the skills of the entrepreneurs, but to the availability of capital.

One way that capital may be accumulated within a country is through foreign investment. The British, for example, provided much of the capital that was required to develop the rail system in the United States and in Europe. This provided mutual benefit for both the British and the countries on the receiving end of this investment. The British earned profits through their ownership of the rail systems and the receiving countries, even with a temporary “unfavorable” balance of trade, obtained the benefits of the rail system including expanded productivity which, over time, allowed them to purchase stock in the rail companies from the British.

Foreign investment allows the capital accumulation in one country to speed up the development of other countries, all without a one-sided sacrifice on the part of the country providing the investment. Wars (especially world wars), protectionism, and domestic taxation destroy this mutually beneficial process. When countries impose tariffs or expropriate the capital that belongs to foreign investors, they “prevent or to slow down the accumulation of domestic capital and to put obstacles in the way of foreign capital.”

The classical liberal ideas of the philosophers of the eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries helped create the constrained governments and economic freedom that led to the explosion of economic growth Mises discussed in the first lecture. But the emergence of minority “pressure groups,” what we would call “special interest groups” today, directed politicians away from classical liberal ideals and toward interventionism. The groups that would benefit from various interventions lobby the government to grant them favors like monopoly privileges, taxes on competition (including tariffs), and subsidies. And, as we have seen, this interventionist spiral tends toward socialism and totalitarianism. The “resurgence of the warlike spirit” in the twentieth century brought about world wars and exacerbated the totalitarian trends even in the once exemplary nations.

The concomitant rise in government expenditures made fiat money and inflation too tempting. The wars and special projects advocated by the pressure groups were expensive, and so budget constraints were discarded in favor of debasement.

This, Mises says, explains the downfall of civilization. He points to the Roman Empire as an example:

What had taken place? What was the problem? What was it that caused the disintegration of an empire which, in every regard, had attained the highest civilization ever achieved before the eighteenth century? The truth is that what destroyed this ancient civilization was something similar, almost identical to the dangers that threaten our civilization today: on the one hand it wasinterventionism, and on the other hand,inflation.

Mises finds hope in the fact that the detractors of economic freedom, like Marx and Keynes, do not represent the masses or even a majority. Marx, for example, “wasnota man from the proletariat. He was the son of a lawyer. … He was supported by his friend Friedrich Engels, who—being a manufacturer—was the worst type of ‘bourgeois,’ according to socialist ideas. In the language of Marxism, he was an exploiter.”

This implies that the fate of civilization depends on a battle of ideas, and Mises thought that good ideas would win:

I consider it as a very good sign that, while fifty years ago, practically nobody in the world had the courage to say anything in favor of a free economy, we have now, at least in some of the advanced countries of the world, institutions that are centers for the propagation of a free economy.

May we continue Mises’s project and fulfill his hope. What the world needs is “Menos Marx, Mais Mises.”

Appearing on a podcast with Marc Elias, the Democrat super-lawyerwho laid the legal groundworkfor vote-by-mail in 2020 & was involved in the ""Steele Dossier"" purchase, Clinton suggested that""Putin does what [Trump] would like to do. Kill his opposition.""

[Maybe they just committed suicide like Vince Foster and all those other associates?]

According to Hillary, who helped France murder Gaddafi (after he wanted a mere5 billion euros / yearto stop illegals from flooding into Europe), Trump ""really"" wants to ""imprison his opposition, drive journalists into exile, rule without any check or balance.""

""We have to be very conscious of how he sees the world because in that world, he only sees strong men leaders.He sees Putin. He sees Xi. He sees Kim Jong Un in North Korea,"" the failed presidential candidate continued. ""Those are the people he is modelling himself after and we’ve been down this road in our, you know, world history. We sure don’t want to go down that again.""

According to Hillary, if Trump ""ever gets back near the White House again, it will be like having a dictator.I don’t say that lightly. Go back and read Project 2025. They’re going to fire everybody. The person in the government who knows about the next pandemic? Get rid of him.""

2024-04-20 16:58:09,House Passes Ukraine Funding Bill On Hitler's Birthday,https://web.archive.org/web/20240421105615/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-20/house-passes-ukraine-funding-bill-hitlers-birthday,"As Zero Hedgereported today, Congress passed a package of bills to fund the Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan while not providing any additional money for U.S. border security. That Congress passed Ukraine funding on Hitler's birthday probably won't go unnoticed byUkrainian Neo-Nazis, who have been among the most enthusiastic opponents of Russia since the Donbass conflict that preceded the current war started in 2014.

One of the funding packages also allows for the confiscation of Russian assets in the U.S. That got me wondering when the last time the U.S. confiscated a foreign countries assets was (as opposed to freezing them), so I asked ChatGPT:

When is the last time the U.S. confiscating another country's assets (as opposed to freezing them)? The U.S. froze Iranian assets after Iran invaded the U.S. embassy and took embassy staff hostage, but if I recall correctly, those assets were eventually return to Iran.

The distinction between freezing and outright confiscation of assets is significant in international law and diplomacy. When it comes to the United States, cases of asset freezing are more common than outright confiscation, particularly concerning diplomatic or geopolitical disputes.

In the case you mentioned, the U.S. did indeed freeze Iranian assets following the 1979 hostage crisis, where Iranian militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 American hostages.The assets were frozen to apply pressure on Iran to resolve the crisis.These assets, however, were not confiscated permanently; they were indeed returned as part of the Algiers Accords in 1981, which was a settlement that facilitated the release of the hostages and resolved various claims between the U.S. and Iran.

Regarding actual confiscation of another country's assets,historical instances where the U.S. might have taken such a step are less frequent and typically tied to periods of open warfare or similar extreme circumstances.One notable example is during World War II, when the U.S. confiscated German and Japanese assets.This was done under the context of the Trading with the Enemy Act, where assets owned by countries at war with the U.S. were seized. These assets were used to fund war efforts and were not returned post-war, representing a rare instance of outright asset confiscation rather than mere freezing.

One of the reasons the U.S. dollar is the world's reserve currency is because, historically, foreign assets have been pretty safe here (unless your country is actually at war with us, as Germany and Japan were in World War II). We've already raised the inflation risk of foreign nations holding assets here with our out-of-control deficit spending; if we add the risk of outright confiscation, presumably China and other countries with significant U.S. dollar assets will want higher interest rates to compensate them for that risk. At a time when we have unprecedented levels of debt, this seems inauspicious.

Confiscating Russia's assets also eliminates obvious leverage we could have used to end the Ukraine War: offering to unfreeze their assets as part of a broader settlement (which might have included paying the Ukraine for land annexed by Russia, as we did with Mexico after the Mexican-American War). Now U.S. dollar supremacy may eventually end up being another casualty of the Ukraine War, which has led to so much unnecessary human suffering since Western leaderssabotaged a Russia-Ukraine peacedeal early on.

St. Louis Universityplans to host transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney to speak on campus next week and denied College Republicans’ request to host an event with a former NCAA swimmer a day later.

The event will be hosted by the St. Louis University Great Issues Committee on Monday, which is part of the school’s Student Activities Board, according to theSt. Louis Post.

Mulvaney gained attention in April 2023 after a paid partnership with Bud Light, sparking heavy criticism from conservatives.

According to the report, St. Louis University College Republicans President Alexandra Leung said thatadministrators at the institution denied their request to host Paula Scanlan, a women’s sports activist.

Despite the event occurring a day after Mulvaney’s speech, the university said that itssecurity couldn’t accommodate the event.

“Mulvaney’s comments have been deemed disrespectful and derogatory towards women and to SLU’s central mission,”said Leung.

While Leung says that Mulvaney’s message is at odds with the university’s catholic teachings, her College Republicans chapter has no plans to protest the event.

While St. Louis University didn’t disclose how much the speech costs, in Summer 2023, there was an honorarium of $40,000 for organizations interested in hosting Mulvaney for an event, according toYAF.

Just a few months prior, the University of Pittsburgh’s Rainbow Alliancesecured $26,250 from its student government to host Mulvaney.

On this 4/20, the birthday of the world’s most infamous Adolf, let’s note that Germany’s trajectory — from the world’s most notorious ethnonationalist state a mere 80 years ago to its current form, a multicultural cesspool of anarcho-tyranny — has to break some kind of historical record for irony.

Related:Germany: Afghan Migrant Does a Diversity™, Rapes Drunk Teenager on Subway Platform 'For Hours'

“The number of foreign suspects soaredto around 923,000 last year,representing a massive 18 percent increase in just one yearnationwide, according to crime statistics from the German Interior Ministry released on Tuesday. However, the even more shocking number may have to do with violent crimes, which soared to record levels in 2023.

The data from the interior ministry shows that41 percent of all crime suspects are foreigners, with 2.246 million people in the country suspected of a crime in 2023, which is7.3 percent more than in 2022. Overall, foreigners only represent 15 percent of the population.

This corresponds to an increase of almost 18 percent, reports Die Welt, citing the as yet unpublished crime statistics for 2023 from the Federal Ministry of the Interior. They now account for almost 41 percent of all suspects. A total of 2.246 million people in Germany were suspected of a crime – 7.3 percent more than in 2022.”

It’s frankly downright perplexing and remarkable, in equal measure, that the German government still publishes these statistics and lets the media report upon them to the people.

Alas, that may not last long, as a Final Solution, as it were, to the mass-migration-as-loving-diversity-boon narrative problem is apparently in the works: reclassify all the migrants as Germans!

“The shocking numbers have hit Germany like a thunderclap and could have a number of political implications.

The head of the German Police Union, Rainer Wendt, slammed Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) after the drastic rise in foreign crime was revealed.

‘The Federal Minister of the Interior is becoming more and more like ‘Nancy in Wonderland’ when she is astonished to discover that Germany has become more violent,’ Wendt told Bild. He argued that one would only be surprised with this outcome ‘if one has completely lost contact with the population.’…

The government is now racing to naturalize millions of foreigners in order to ensure that they are not counted under “foreign” crime but are instead counted as ‘Germans,’as German crime statistics list anyone who commits a crime as ‘German’ regardless of their migration background as long as they have a German passport.”

That’s one way to solve the migrant crimewave problem — the Diverse™, and Equitable™, and Inclusive™ way.

This action sparked new fears of another maritime chokepoint becoming disrupted as the crisis in the Middle East escalated. It also prompted a plea by the international shipping industry to the United Nations, urging an increase in military patrols along key shipping routes.

First reported by the maritime news websitegGaptain, an open letter co-signed by 16 maritime industry associations and social partners, calls for urgent assistance and reminds countries about their responsibilities under international law.

""However, the incident this weekend, when the vessel MSC Aries was seized by Iranian forces at 06.37 UTC – 50 nautical miles north-east of Fujairah, United Arab Emirates on Saturday 13 April, has once again highlighted the intolerable situation where shipping has become a target.This is unacceptable,"" the signatories of the letter stated.

""Given the continually evolving andsevere threat profile within the area, we call on you for enhanced coordinated military presence, missions and patrols in the region, to protect our seafarers against any further possible aggression,"" they said, adding, ""The industry associations ask thatall member states be formally reminded of their responsibilities under international law. And we ask that all efforts possible are brought to bear to release the seafarers and protect the safe transit of ships.""

After the MSC Aries seizure in the Strait of Hormuz, we published a note titled""Heading For Supply Shock? Four Maritime Chokepoints Flash Red As Escalating Conflict Looms,""outlining the maritime chokepoints, including theSuez Canal, Bab-El Mandeb Strait, and Strait of Hormuz, through which a quarter of all global trade flows, that are experiencing increased conflict.

In a recent note, MUFG provided aglobal snapshotof the world's maritime chokepoints.

The team at ING Global Markets Research warned last week, ""Global shipping routes are already heavily impacted from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden because of ongoing geopolitical strife.If the Strait of Hormuz is in any way disrupted, the impact on oil and global trade could be huge.""

Disruptions along critical maritime chokepoints in the Middle East are a direct result of thefailed foreign policy decisions pushed by the Biden administration and former President Obama. Furthermore, the inability of Western militaries to secure the southern Red Sea through Operation Prosperity Guardian is a sign of weakness as theworld fracturesinto a multipolar state of chaos.

Facing mounting budget woes this election year, as spending far outpaces revenues, the City of San Francisco is scrambling to reform its infamously large and complex tax burden on business.

San Francisco’s five largest employers now account for nearly a quarter of the city’s total business tax revenue, according to an April 14 report in the San Francisco Examiner. If any were to relocate outside of the city, such would leave San Francisco—currently facing an $800 million budget deficit—vulnerable.

As such,Mayor London Breed and city officials are currently negotiating with business and labor leadersto devise tax reform measures for the November ballot that could simplify its tax code and even out the load on top businesses, the San Francisco Examiner reported.

In particular, city officials saythey would like to see changes that would not incentivize businesses to move jobs out of San Francisco, since the city’s largest employers are required to pay a disproportionate amount of business taxes.

Butshifting the tax burden elsewhere, such as increasing the city’s already large sales tax,could hurt a retail sector that has been decimated by a flurry of closures in recent years, analysts say.

City Controller Greg Wagner has said the complexity and number of new taxes passed by voters in recent years combined with a poor economy have increased tax disputes between the city and large businesses, according to Alyssa Sewlal, a spokesperson for his office.

Such disputes include a legal demand from General Motors for more than $121 million in tax refunds, as well as tens of millions of dollars in refund claims, and settlements and lawsuits on behalf of companies who say they were overtaxed such as Deloitte, Gap, WeWork, AppLovin, Chime Financial, and Block—formerly Square—since 2020, according to the San Francisco Examiner.

At the same time,the mayor’s office has been trying to direct more attention toward helping tourist-reliant businesses including hotels, restaurants, and arts and entertainment groups, including launching new small business grants and laying out plans to revitalize its downtown. Several such businesses have denounced the city’s street conditions, crime, costly permitting, and escalated taxes.

Factors such as a struggling office market aided by the rise of remote work, retail and commercial vacancies, poor recovery from the pandemic, and lagging tourism have played a role in revenues not keeping up with city spending that has increased significantly over the past decade.

Currently at $14.6 billion, San Francisco’s budget rivals most major U.S. cities. Because it is forecast to escalate by more than $1 billion over the next five years, the city will be on track to post a deficit surpassing $1 billion by 2027 barring major changes, the San Francisco Examiner reported.

City employee salaries, pension benefits, and health care costs are projected to increase by about $500 million within the upcoming four fiscal years, according to Ms. Breed’s office.

The mayor, who is up for re-election in November, told city departments in December they will be required to cut their budgets by about 10 percent in the upcoming fiscal year, and that they must also consider an additional 5 percent in cuts as a “contingency reduction.”

The city’s next budget, which goes into effect July 1, is scheduled to go before the San Francisco Board of Supervisors for a vote June 1.

2024-04-20 20:10:00,"Securities Analyst Jobs In China Are ""Permanently"" Disappearing",https://web.archive.org/web/20240421105615/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/securities-analyst-jobs-china-are-permanently-disappearing#comment-stream,"The days of million dollar analyst jobs in the securities industry in China look to be all but gone.

That was the topic of a newBloomberg article last weekwhich detailed exactly how the industry is ""retrenching after years of expansion"". Bloomberg's description of the industry's cutbacks is based on discussions with about 20 analysts and former analysts, who chose to remain anonymous or only use their first names.

These reductions are occurring amidst a prolonged market downturn that has lowered trading commissions and increased regulatory restrictions on research publications. It marks a significant shift from previous years when brokerages were actively recruiting and offering substantial salaries to top analysts.

Several senior analysts at Shanghai's state-owned Guotai Junan Securities resigned following pay cuts and stricter performance requirements, the article points out.

Another Shenzhen-based brokerage cut 40% of its analyst staff and reduced their 2023 bonuses by over 50%. Additional cost-cutting measures at other firms include decreased meal and travel budgets.

Sun Jianbo, a former chief strategist at China Galaxy Securities Co. who now runs China Vision Capital, told Bloomberg: “Now with the trading fees cut, the bubble in the research circle will also burst.”

“There’s no other way around. The only thing that matters now is to stay employed. So my approach is to grab a job first and see what comes next,"" said one 28 year old energy analyst named Anna.

She said her team was cut down from 7 analysts to 2.

Chinese brokerages have traditionally assessed their research analysts based on the trading commissions—referred to as ""soft dollars"" or paidian—they generate from clients, rather than the accuracy of their forecasts, Bloombergwrites.

This approach spurred the aggressive expansion of research teams and high salaries for analysts.According to China Vision Capital, the number of sell-side analysts in China has surged by almost 70% over the last decade, now exceeding 4,800.

Major firms like China International Capital and Citic Securities employ over 300 and nearly 200 analysts, respectively. Top-performing analysts, particularly winners of popular research contests like New Fortune, could earn up to 10 million yuan annually.

According to Brook Zhang of Bo Le Associates, analysts with ten years of experience might earn a basic salary of about 800,000 yuan, while those with five years can earn around 500,000 yuan, with bonuses ranging from three to 24 months of pay depending on market conditions.

However, the landscape is shifting due to recent regulatory changes reducing trading fees and discouraging the use of commissions for research payments. Additionally, investor interest in China's stock market has waned after three years of losses, diminishing demand for equity research.

This, along with a downturn in sectors like proprietary trading and investment banking and new restrictions on stock market practices, is driving brokerages to significantly cut costs.

“I think these cuts reflect a structural change in the securities business and are hence permanent,”concluded Chen Zhiwu, a professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong. You can read Bloomberg's full reporthere.

Report comes amid concerns about CCP’s influence, human rights violations...

American universities have entered more than $2.3 billion in contracts with China in the past decade amid on-going concerns about the influence of its communist government on U.S. higher education, a new investigation found.

These contracts included agricultural research regarding orange crops, trainings for airline pilots, and medical trials for a tumor treatment drug developed by a Chinese pharmaceutical company, theWall Street Journalreported.

The investigation uncovered approximately 2,900 contracts from 2012 and 2024 between Chinese businesses and about 200 U.S. public colleges and universities in all 50 states.

Some involved specialized training, such as $37 million in contracts between Chinese airlines and the University of North Dakota to train and license pilots.

Another $1.8 million in contracts with China’s Institute of Navel Orange at Gannan Normal University and the University of Florida involved researching tree genetics and diseases affecting citrus fruit, according to the investigation.

But others were less specific.

For example, “all three of China’s major government-owned oil companies have funded contracts for $100,000 or more at the University of Texas at Austin, which the school describes only as ‘research activity,’” the investigation found.

The report continued:

Some of the biggest-value China contracts feature franchise-type arrangements for overseas satellite campuses. New York University, which the Education Department database shows has been the largest single recipient of Chinese funding, reported two contracts totaling over $46.5 million for 2021 alone for its Shanghai branch.

The Juilliard School has disclosed over $133 million in such funding over more than a decade for its Tianjin Juilliard School near Beijing, appointed with some 120 Steinway pianos.

These partnerships have U.S. politicians, academics, and students concerned. The Chinese Communist Party has been accused of numerous human rights abuses, from free speech censorship to forced labor and torture to genocide of the Uyghurs, an ethnic minority population.

According to the report:

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies warn that China’s state has encouraged theft of technological secrets at universities, spread pro-Beijing propaganda, stifled campus debate and harassed students.

Beijing dismisses such characterizations. Its officials say ethnic Chinese students and professors have been unfairly targeted in the U.S., including on American campuses, and urged the U.S. to be mindful of its reputation for academic freedom. The Chinese Embassy in Washington didn’t respond to detailed questions about the university contracts.

American defense officials raised similar concerns about China and artificial intelligence technology in a 2021reportby the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.

“China’s domestic use of AI is a chilling precedent for anyone around the world who cherishes individual liberty,”the report stated.

Meanwhile, the Athenai Institute, a bipartisan student-led organization, is urging U.S. universities to divest from Chinese government-controlled entities,The College Fixreportedthis month.

Lawmakers also have been taking action.In 2023, for example, Floridaenacteda law restricting public universities and colleges “from accepting grants from or participating in partnerships or agreements” with China and other foreign countries “of concern.”

In a fresh interview with NBC, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian dismissed much of the initial reporting in the West concerning the strike, which appeared to center on the city of Isfahan - which hosts a nuclear energy site - as ""not accurate"".

""What happened last night was not a strike,"" the Iranian top diplomatasserted. He claimed that the the attack involved merely two or three small UAVs, which""were more like toys that our children play with, not drones.""

He said that the UAV's were all taken out by Iran's anti-air defenses, and even claimed they took off from inside Iran, suggesting that the attack took place by proxy.

Iranian state TV had reported shortly after midnight as the attack was unfolding that ""three drones were observed in the sky over Isfahan. The air defense system became active and destroyed these drones in the sky.""

However, Israeli media along with the New York Times are saying the whole thing was meant as a strong symbolic message to Iran that Israel can inflict severe damage at will if itchooses to:

The alleged Israeli strike overnight Thursday-Friday on Iranian air defenses near the Natanz nuclear siteused a high-tech missile that was able to evade Iran’s radar systems, in a move“calibrated to make Iran think twice”before launching another direct attack on Israel,The New York Timesreported on Saturday.

Two unnamed Western officials cited by the newspaper said the missile aimed to show Tehran that Israel isable to dodge and neutralize its defenses.

Two Iranian officials said thestrike hit a Russian-made S-300 air defense system. They told the newspaper that Iran had not detected intrusions into its airspace from drones, missiles or aircraft.

Israeli sources say that IAF jets were able to launch missiles from outside Iranian airspace, and further did not use Jordanian airspace, given concerns that Amman could be dragged into the conflict.

""Satellite imagery seen by the Times of Israelshowed damage to the radar of an S-300 system at the Eighth Shekari Air Base in Isfahan, said to be part of an array defending the nearby top-secret Natanz nuclear site,"" Israeli media reports further. ""The imagery was not immediately permitted for publication, per the policy of the agency that took the photo.""

But there are contrary reports among Western press accounts. For example, there's this satellite imaging analysis in CNN which points to an attack which did almost nothing in terms ofserious damage:

There does not appear to be any extensive damage at anair base purportedly targetedby an Israeli military strike, according to exclusive satellite images obtained by CNN from Umbra Space.

The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images were taken around 10:18 a.m. local time.

There does not appear to be any large craters in the ground and there are no apparent destroyed buildings. Additional visual satellite imagery will be needed to check for burn scars – which cannot be seen by SAR images -- around the complex.

The Iranians have not confirmed or admitted to any fighter jet-launched missiles being used in the attack, as they continue tointentionally downplay it...

The IRGC has been trolling Israel really hard about the alleged use of quadcopters.They posted this video comparing Iran's retaliation to Israel's and used an actual drone toy ad from the early 2000s.This is where things are at, folks. 🙈pic.twitter.com/i3AEOHcHE0

Some Israeli officials actually agree that it was too small of a retaliatory strike. Most notably, Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir had quicklytweeted outin the wake of the overnight attack that the attack on Iranwas in the end""lame"".

Iranian leaders have meanwhile declared the utter 'failure' of efforts to attack the Islamic Republic, and have further warned that Tehran won't hesitate to strike back 'harder' if attacked by Israel. But the strategy of Iranian officials for now seems to be to simply deny that any level of major operation by Israel took place.

2024-04-20 21:55:00,Calif. Dems Tout Ties To Criminal Leniency Group,https://web.archive.org/web/20240421105615/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/calif-dems-tout-ties-criminal-leniency-group,"Authored by Susan Crabtree via RealClearPolitics,

The mayors of California's three biggest cities have rankled some progressive activists in recent months by joining a wave of fellow Democrats renouncing once popular initiatives to defund the police, reduce sentencing, and undertake other criminal justice reforms amid deep concerns over public safety.

Facing a public backlash over rampant thefts and an epidemic of fentanyl deaths related to drug trafficking, San Francisco Mayor London Breed and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria in recent months have joined the GOP fight to dismantle Proposition 47. That law, approved by voters in 2014, recategorized thefts below $950 from felonies to misdemeanors, and many critics blame it for the spate of smash-and-grab robberies at department and convenience stores across California.

“We should be locking up criminals, not laundry detergent,” Gloria, who refers to himself as a progressive Democrat, declared in his state-of-the-city address in January.

Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Basshas called foradding hundreds of police officers to the city’s rolls and boosting their pay.

But Democratic incumbentsand candidates in several of the most competitive U.S. House of Representatives races across California – the outcome of which will play a critical role in determining control of the chamber in the next Congress –are either swimming against the tough-on-crime tide or trying to avoid alienating a key ally.

These Democrats have been touting their close ties to a progressive lobbying powerhouse that helped usher in some of the most controversial changes to criminal justice laws across the state in recent years.

Equality California began as a Sacramento-based LGBTQ+ advocacy group 20 years ago but has since become a major player on several issues, including its self-proclaimed priority of transforming the Golden State’s criminal justice system. The influential organization, which rakes in millions from Hollywood celebrities and business interests andreceived a state grant windfall last year, has been instrumental in promoting a reform agenda that many prominent California Democrats are now trying to reverse.

The group campaigned aggressively to eliminate cash bail for many types of crimes, legalize prostitution, shorten probation periods for misdemeanors and some felonies, and end qualified immunity for police,making it easier for victims of alleged excessive force and other police misconduct to sue officers. The push to lift legal protections for police failed on the federal level but largely succeeded in California when Gov. Gavin Newsomsigned a Senate billinto law in the fall of 2021.

In 2022, the group’s PAC alsocontributed $5,000to embattled Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon, the original author of Proposition 47. Gascon survived a close recall effort in 2022, just two months after San Francisco voters ousted District Attorney Chesa Boudin in a blow to the national movement toward more lenient prosecution given the city’s status as one of the nation’s most liberal enclaves.

In the middle of the riots after the police-custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis,Equality California was one of several organizations thatcalled fordonations to groups on the “frontlines” of the protests, including the Minnesota Freedom Fund.That fund eventually received $35 million in donations during the tumultuous summer of 2020 and used the money tobail out dozens of defendants, including those accused of murder, violent felonies, and sex crimes.

Like Equality California, the Minnesota Freedom Fund aggressivelypushed for defunding the police and ending cash bailfor all individuals accused of crimes.

Under the “issues” section on its website, Equality California lists “criminal justice reform” first among all the issues it works on, including education, faith and religion, gun safety, hate crimes and safety, health care and HIV issues.

“LGBTQ+ people face disproportionate rates of arrest, conviction, incarceration, and recidivism compared to their non-LGBTQ+ peers,” the website asserts in explaining why the group prioritizes reducing criminal penalties and is pushing for more leniency in other aspects of criminal justice law.

Seven Democrats in the most competitive House races have touted their Equality California endorsements on social media. They include Adam Gray, Josh Harder, Joe Kerr, David Min, Will Rollins, Rudy Salas, and George Whitesides.

Whitesides (pictured at top), a former aerospace executive challenging GOP Rep. Mike Garcia in a key House battleground north of Los Angeles, has the closest ties to Equality California. He and his wife donated an undisclosed amount to the group in both 2020 and 2021.

Those donations qualified the Whitesides as Equality California’s “regional influencers” for 2020 and 2021.It’s a title the couple shared with the hedge-fund billionaire Tom Steyer, record executive David Geffen’s foundation, California Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and her husband, as well as Rep. Sara Jacobs (the granddaughter of Qualcomm founder Irwin Jacobs), and Tom Sandoval, a cast member of the TV reality series “Vanderpump Rules.” (The 2020 and 2021 annual reports do not list an amount associated with the “regional influencers” tier, butthe group’s 2019 annual reports notes that a such a designation is earned for contributions of $10,000 to $19,999.)

Whitesides’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment about whether he backs Equality California’s criminal justice priorities.

In February, Will Rollins, a former federal prosecutor challenging veteran GOP Rep. Ken Calvert in a district stretching from Riverside to Palm Springs, touted his Equality California endorsement onX.com, along with a photo of himself dining with the group’s board of directors.

“It was great joining @eqca board members of their board of directors lunch,” Rollins tweeted. “I am proud to be endorsed by Equality California in my race for Congress. When I get to D.C., I am going to fight to advance LGBTQ+ rights for all Americans. Together, we will win.”

The Calvert-Rollins race is a closely fought rematch, with crime taking center stage. Rollins has touted his role as a prosecutor and has criticized Calvert for voting in favor of the First Step Act, President Trump’s signature justice reform package, which released more than 2,200 federal inmates in 2019. The bill was passed with broad bipartisan support in Congress before the pandemic-era crime spikes while the criminal justice reform agenda was gaining Republican and Democratic support. Media outlets have since reported that it released more than 100 violent criminals and sex offenders.

In a local newspaper op-ed,Calvert tried to lump Rollins into the same camp as Gascon and Boudin, calling him “the worst kind of liberal prosecutor” who “routinely cuts soft plea deals with perps and wants to reduce sentences for criminals wreaking havoc on our streets.” Last month, Calvert’s campaign also cuta television adcalling Rollins “extreme” and noting that he “even supports reducing sentences for violent criminals including drug traffickers while California fentanyl deaths skyrocket.”

Rollins has denied the accusations about supporting cash bail and lighter sentences for violent criminals and drug traffickers, asserting that he had a 99% conviction rate and helped put “murders, terrorists, MS-13 and Sinaloa cartel members in prison.” He was less forthright about cash bail, noting that defendants that pose a danger to society or are a flight risk should be detained before trial, but Rollins didn’t indicate whether he supports ending cash bail in other circumstances.

The results of the Calvert-Rollins face-off in 2022 were so close that the Democratic hopeful was attending a new member orientation in Washington when new alerts came across his phone that he had lost to Calvert, the dean of the California delegation.

David Min, a Democratic state senator running against GOP attorney and former state legislator Scott Baugh in a tight race for the Orange County seat vacated by Rep. Katie Porter, was the only Democrat to respond to RCP’s inquiry about the Equality California’s endorsement, and whether he backs the group’s criminal justice agenda.

Concerns about public safety have been making headlines in the country in recent weeks as the traditionally more conservative area strives to discourage criminal elements from nearby Los Angeles from becoming active there. Last month, the Orange County District Attorney’s Officeannounced a novel public safetycampaign aimed at deterring thieves with a message plastered on billboards and bus ads: “Crime doesn’t pay in Orange County.”

“If you steal, we prosecute,” the signs sternly warn.

Min, who was arrested last year for drunk driving in a taxpayer-funded car, still managed to outmaneuver fellow Democrat Joanna Weiss in the primary and secure the endorsement of Porter and the California Democratic Party.

Min campaign spokesman Orrin Evans forwarded the lawmaker’s endorsements from the state’s largest police union, the Peace Officers Research Association of California, or PORAC, and the California Fraternal Order of Police. Evans also touted Min’s record of supporting police budget priorities, including successful requests he made for $2 million for a “real-time crime center” to help police track crime quickly and $1 million for new electric police cruisers.

“Sen. Min has always ensured that law enforcement and first responders have the tools they need to keep Southern California’s families safe and secure,”Roger Hilton, president of the state Fraternal Order of Police, said in a statement along with the endorsement.

In contrast, Baugh has the backing of Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes and several House Republican leaders. In an interview with RCP, the former GOP leader of the state assembly cited a strong tough-on-crime record dating back to the 1990s. Barnes and local District Attorney Todd Spitzer also voted for Baugh to become the chairman of a local gang reduction and intervention program.

Baugh, who previously served as county GOP chairman, countered that Min has supported some of the same sweeping criminal justice reforms as Equality California during his time in Sacramento. Min voted in favor of a2021 billeliminating cash bail andanother measure in 2022to automatically seal many felons’ criminal records, including domestic violence convictions.

“Min’s hiding behind the PORAC labor endorsement to run from his progressive policies, including support for no-cash bail,” Baugh said in the interview. “This is the type of cowardly behavior we don’t need in Congress.”

Equality California also keeps track of state and federal lawmakers’ legislative records on key priorities and issues an annual scorecard. In 2022, the score included votes on several bills, including the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which, if passed, would have eliminated qualified immunity for police. According to the Congressional Budget Office, it also would have cost local departments hundreds of millions of dollars in training and equipment just when several major cities across the country had slashed funding for police.

While Congress was considering the measure, the Fraternal Order of Police argued that ending qualified immunity was “anti-police” andwould drastically reducethe number of candidates choosing to become police officers.

Over the past several years, police departments across the country, including in San Francisco and Los Angeles, have faced severe staffing shortages as they struggle to recruit and retain officers. At the height of the defund the police movement, Californialost 2,100 policeofficers (with full arrest powers) and roughly 1,100 civilian staff, diminishing the number of patrol officers to 1991 levels.

In 2021 Equality California scored votes on a handful of bills, including the George Floyd Justice in Policing Actand a measure that would have allowed adults who entered the U.S. as undocumented children to become lawful permanent residents and citizens. That year (and in 2022), Reps. Mike Levin, who is facing a rematch from GOP challenger Matt Gunderson, and Harder, who is in a tight contest against Stockton Mayor Kevin Lincoln, earned 100% ratings from Equality California.

As state legislators, Gray, Min, and Salas received a 100% rating on the group’s 2022 scorecard, with Min maintaining his perfect rating from 2021.

With so many leading California Democrats backtracking on criminal justice reforms, Republicans plan to hammer their opponents who remain undecided about repealing Proposition 47 and other more lenient laws as soft on crime and weak on the border. Despite polls showing voters deeply concerned about illegal immigration and President Biden’s open border policies, California Democrats have continued to support broad amnesty for illegal immigrants and the state’s controversial sanctuary state law, both of which Equality California strongly backs.

In the state, border issues may divide some heavily Latino districts, but Republicans have a greater chance for traction when it comes to crime. Americans’ worries about what they describe as the nation’s crime problems are at a recent high, with 63% characterizing public safety concerns as either extremely or very serious in aNovember Gallup survey. That’s up from 54% when Gallup last polled voters on the issue and the highest level the polling company has recorded in recent years. The prior high of 60% was recorded in the initial 2000 polling, as well as in 2010 and 2016.

It's hard to predict whether support for specific criminal justice reforms, such as eliminating cash bail, will hold sway with voters. But with Breed, who is in a tough reelection fight for mayor, and other Democrats pivoting away from the reform movement, it will be easier to focus voters on the issue.

While there is little comprehensive research about the impact of eliminating cash bail on crime,a study by the Yolo County District Attorney’s Office in Northern Californiaearly last year found thatindividuals released on cash-free or low-cost bail were much more likely to re-offend than those who pasted bail. They were also far more likely to commit new violent offenses.

The study used a random sample of 100 people arrested during the county’s zero-bail policy, which was in effect from April 2020 through May 2021. It compared those results to 100 people who were arrested and posted bail in 2018 and 2019. The study found that people released were arrested for new crimes at an average rate 70% higher than those who posted bail, committed felonies 90% more often, and committed misdemeanors 123% more often.

Nearly 1 billion people are eligible to vote and to determine whether 73-year-old Narendra Modi, leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), will rule the nation for a third consecutive term.

The elections kicked off yesterday (Friday) and will be carried out in seven phases due to the sheer size of the country, ending June 4.

As Statista's Anna Fleck shows in the following chart,the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance alliance won 303 out of 550 parliamentary seats in India’s Lok Sabha general elections in 2019 and 282 out of 543 parliamentary seats five years before. In this year’s elections, the NDC is projected to win as many as 399 seats.

Opposition parties have banded together, led by the Indian National Congress party (INC), to form a 26-member alliance, named the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) in an attempt to stop this from happening.

Critics decry the BJP as Hindu nationalists and fear that India will become further divided, accusing the incumbent government of having enabled the persecution of minorities, particularly Muslims, under their rule. Supporters meanwhile praise Modi for securing India’s place as a major global economic power.

The rise of the BJP as India’s majority party was an unlikely one.

Its predecessor, the right-wing Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS) party,gained only marginal supportand joined the Janata Party (People’s Party), which won the 1977 elections as a catch-all union opposing the declaration of a state of emergency in the country.

After the Janata Party dissolved in 1980, the party was recreated as the BJP and started from the bottom again, gaining followers emphasizing Hindu national pride and hardline politics.

2024-04-20 23:05:00,Charter School Founders Accused Of Massive Fraud,https://web.archive.org/web/20240421105615/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/charter-school-founders-accused-massive-fraud,"Authored by Michael Clements via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Prosecutors are accusing three men of bilking Oklahoma out of millions of dollars in public school funds through a charter school plan that one of the defendants told a state district court prioritized income.

Lawyers from the Oklahoma Attorney General’s office began outlining their case during preliminary hearings March 25–March 29 in the District Court of Oklahoma County, in Oklahoma City.

Their case is based on an investigation by the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) and an investigative audit report released by the State Auditor and Inspector’s office on Oct. 1, 2020.

However, a lawyer for one of the defendants says his client is a legitimate businessman who has become the victim of incompetent state officials running a politically motivated investigation.

David Lee Chaney and Benjamin Scott Harris each face prison timeand possibly millions in restitution if convicted of15 criminal charges for their alleged scheme to defraud the state through Epic Charter Schools.

Joshua Brock, former chief financial officer, has agreed to plead guilty and testify for the state in exchange for 15 years of probation with restitution to be determined.

Slouched in the witness stand of Special Judge Jason Glidewell’s courtroom in the Oklahoma County District Court in Oklahoma City, Mr. Brock testified in a low monotone. He wore the tired, disinterested expression of a man who wants his case to end.

The Cushing native was friends with Mr. Harris and had a background in accounting and business finance. He said that around 2009, Mr. Harris began talking with him about charter schools. Mr. Brock also liked the idea of a public school run like a private school.

“I believe in the concept,” Mr. Brock testified.

In Oklahoma, charter schools are publicly funded and open to any student. A board oversees them and may not charge tuition. Charter schools must comply with open records and open meeting laws.

However, they are exempt from such requirements as collective bargaining and credentialing. Students can be taught online, in brick-and-mortar locations, or a combination of both. Parents and teachers have broad latitude in curriculum, hours, and other aspects of a child’s education.

The Oklahoma Department of Education website states that charter schools receive, “Flexibility in exchange for accountability.”

During a 2011 meeting in an Oklahoma City restaurant,Mr. Brock agreed to be the CFO for EYS and Indoor Air Quality Services (IAQS), a business Messrs. Harris and Chaney operated.

In those early days, IAQS paid Mr. Brock. Later, EYS would contract with Mr. Brock’s company,JAB Consulting.

According to aspecial investigative audit reportreleased by Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd in October 2020,the trio raked in at least $125 million of the $458 million in government funds disbursed to the school from 2015 to 2020.

Of that, $45.9 million was paid to Epic Youth Services, a for-profit management company the men set up to handle school affairs.

According to the report, EYS had no employees and was controlled entirely by Messrs. Harris, Chaney, and Brock.

EYS, and therefore the three men, controlled a “Student Learning Fund,” through which $79.3 million in public funds flowed, the report stated.

Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) Special Agent Mark Drummond testified that there may be even more. He said his investigation had found more than 100 accounts that might contain Epic Charter School money.

During preliminary hearings the week of March 25–March 29, 2024, Mr. Brock said EYS had few if any employees and one main objective.

“To minimize costs and maximize profit.”

Ms. Byrd confirmed that some law enforcement agencies are still investigating Epic Charter Schools, though she wouldn’t specify which ones.

She said she is holding on to a second audit report so as not to interfere.

“The second report is pending in the event that it may be needed,” she told The Epoch Times.

According to court records, Mr. Harris founded the non-profit Community Strategies Inc. (CSI) in 2005.

He and Mr. Chaney reportedly set up the for-profit Epic Youth Services (EYS) as the management company for the non-profit Epic Charter Schools. CSI, doing business as Epic Charter Schools, began operating in December 2010.

According to the audit report,funding from the State Department of Education and the federal government went to Epic’s sponsors, who kept 3 percent of sponsorship fees. The remaining 97 percent went to the charter schools through CSI.

The report states that the schools sent 10 percent of the total revenue, including the fees kept by the sponsors, to EYS and money to the Student Learning Fund, which EYS controlled.

Epic Charter’s first sponsor was Graham Public School in Ofuskee County, Oklahoma. Mr. Brock said the small K–12 school was struggling financially and was glad for the cash infusion.

In 2018, Epic split into Epic One-on-One, the online school, and Epic Blended.

Epic Blended is a virtual school that also provides work centers where students can use computers with internet access and receive other types of classroom support.

Rose State College now sponsors Epic Blended, and the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board sponsors Epic One-on-One, an online charter school.

On paper, EYS’s purpose was to handle Epic Charter School’s administrative work and manage its finances. Mr. Brock said that, in reality, EYS had a single purpose.

“The object was to minimize costs, maximize profit,”Mr. Brock testified on March 28.

Mr. Brock said it was the practice to ensure that all invoices added up to the total 10 percent management fee outlined in EYS’s contract. Early on, that was not difficult, as the invoices listed the fee amount.

However, in 2019, HB1395 became the law in Oklahoma. The new law mandated the Oklahoma Cost Accounting System (OCAS), which requires invoices to be itemized using OCAS codes.

Mr. Brock said thatrather than lose money by accurately itemizing, he wrote computer code that automatically divided the fee among the same 14 OCAS codes each month.

So, regardless of how much funding Epic received or what EYS’s actual expenses were, the system would produce invoices totaling 10 percent of the revenue received every month.

Jeanice Wynn said she noticed the questionable invoices soon after she started work at Epic.

She was hired as Deputy Superintendent of Finance in 2021, shortly after the audit report was released. She testified that she took the job with some trepidation.

Epic had already been in the news due to a conflict with the Oklahoma Department of Education.

Disputes over enrollment, attendance requirements, and other issues had prompted then-Gov. Mary Fallin requested OSBI to look into the fledgling charter school in 2013.

While Epic prevailed in most of those disputes, rumors continued to fly.

Ms. Wynn testified that she believed her job had been created in response to the audit report. She said some things, like those oddly uniform invoices, caught her attention almost immediately.

She said the same 14 OCAS codes were used each month, and they always added up to 10 percent of Epic’s total revenue from the state.

According to Ms. Wynn, that is unusual at best.

“That doesn’t happen,” she said.

In addition, some of the codes seemed questionable.For example, invoices for the online school included food service.

When asked how much EYS paid to provide food for Epic’s online students, Mr. Brock answered succinctly."

2024-04-20 23:23:55,The King $ Is Back!,https://web.archive.org/web/20240422124458/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-21/king-back,"While all eyes were blurred by the unfolding regional conflict in the Middle East, Jerome Powell used the opportunity of a speech at the Wilson Economic Forum topivot, but not in the way that Wall Street YOLO investors had hoped for over the past 18 months. In his most direct comment about the FED’s expected path for rates after the inflation boomeranged, Powell admitted that‘recent data show a lack of further progress on inflation.’The bond market didn’t really like that pivot, as it pushed the bear steepening further out of its ‘Halloween hibernation’.

While anyone who understands English would have concluded thatthe FED will NOT cut rates this year, despite the additional comment from FED’s Williams who highlighted that‘while rate-HIKES are not the baseline, they are possible if the data warrants’, the ‘Forward Confusion’ driven myopic Wall Street consensus still discounts more than one interest rate cut for the year, with 88% probability of the first cut to happen now in September.

As mentioned previously, on March 18th, theUSD index triggered a golden crosswith the 50-day moving average crossing once again above the 200-day moving average. Examining the performance of the USD since the beginning of the year reveals a trend which has taken the widespread pessimism about the dollar at the outset of 2024 by surprise. Indeed, theUSD has appreciated against ALL G10 fiat currencies and all except the Peruvian Sol among the EM currenciesof the Bloomberg EM currency index.

At the start of the year, Wall Street was bearish on the Greenback due to theexpectation that the FED would lead other central banks into an interest rate easing cycle.There was a belief that the world would short the USD and flock to other fiat currencies because the FED will pivot first. However, more than a quarter into the year, this narrative has beendisrupted by the return of the inflation boomerang, which has thrown the concept of 'Forward Confusion' regarding easing US monetary policy into disarray.

USD Index (DXY Index); US CPI YoY Change & correlation.

Over the past 40 years, the USD's strengthening has typically coincided with higher 10-year yields and tighter financial conditions. With the FED likely feeling trapped by its 'Forward Confusion' narrative amid the resurgence of inflation and with the US election just seven months away, rather than having to abruptly change course on its narrative and lose faith,the FED could leverage the strengthening USD and rising 10-year yields to tighten financial conditions. This strategy could ultimately weaken the economy, therebyreducing the impact of inflation, which remains largely supply-driven.

Chicago FED US Financial Conditions Index (blue line); US 10-Year Yield (red line); USD Index (DXY index) (green line).

Outside the US, on March 22nd, the ‘venerable’ Swiss National Bank took the lead among G10 central banks and surprised financial markets by unexpectedly cutting interest rates by 25 basis points. The SNB's decision is significant not only because it marks Switzerland as the first major economy to lower rates since the Covid-19 pandemic, but also because itintensifies pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BOE) to take action sooner rather than later.

Not too long ago, the consensus pointed towards'June' as ‘THE month’ for the FED and the ECB to ease monetary policy.However, in the last few weeks, the FED encountered obstacles as stronger-than-expected labour market data and persistent (services) CPI figures which tempered its intentions. It's now becoming evident that 'June' is no longer the pivotal month for the FED unless it is ready to let go inflation higher.

On the other side of the pond, in Europe, the European Central Bank provided stronghints at its April meeting that a cut in June is imminent. While persistent price pressures in services remain somewhat of a concern, this doesn't seem to hinder the likelihood of a first cut at the next policy meeting for Lagarde and her team. Indeed, the Council appears to have firmly decided that:

thedata, reflecting a weak economy and disinflationary forces, have continued to move in the right direction, and

implementing a few cuts(starting with one) would still maintain policy restrictive enough to avoid derailing the disinflation process.

Spread between FED & ECB rate cuts as of December 2024 (blue line); EUR/USD Fx rate (axis inverted; red line).

Despite its mantra of 'data dependence' and inflation not yet reaching its target, the ECB Council seems convinced that a cut would be appropriate. The idea that ‘We will not wait for everything to be 2% before we cut’ encapsulates the ECB's current stance, suggesting agreater concern about making a policy error by easing too slowlydespite sticky services inflation and labor market tightness. By emphasizing its data dependence and avoiding pre-commitment to any specific easing trajectory, the ECB likely believes it can manage the risk of  an energy driven return of the inflation boomerang at an acceptable level as wage growth in the Euro area has been slowing and well below levels reached in the US.

A weakening of the Euro resulting from this divergence in monetary policy stances could however potentially lead toa slower easing cycle by the ECB at some point. However, it's worth noting that according to models, a significant drop in the euro would be needed before it has a material impact on inflation. As a rough estimate, a1% drop in EUR/USD, associated with a 0.5% drop in the effective exchange rate, would lead to a modest increase in domestic inflation of around 0.05% in the first year and 0.15% after three years. Conversely, one could argue that higher US rates might spill over to Europe, dampening the effectiveness of ECB easing measures and potentially justifying a slightly faster cutting cycle by the ECB.

Overall, the ECB, which is even more politically driven than the FED, would likely aim toprevent the economy from weakening excessively leading up to the European Parliament election. Indeed, there is a high chance that Euro-sceptic parties may gain significant traction in the new parliament and potentially take the lead in some key countries later this year. Therefore, the ECB may be‘politically motivated’to take measures to support economic stability and confidence in the eurozone amidst these political shifts.

Spread between US & EUR Zone Economic Surprise (blue line); EUR/USD FX rate (axis inverted; red line).

Another headwind for the EUR is therebound in energy prices, particularly natural gas prices. This increase has been influenced by therecent escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.Over the past weeks, there have been reports of the destruction of key gas storage facilities in Ukraine and refineries in Russia, exacerbating concerns about energy supply disruptions and contributing to upward pressure on natural gas prices.

Historically, there has been anegative correlation between the Dutch TTF Natural Gas forward price and the EUR/USD FX rate, as higher natural gas prices have been a leading indicator of rising economic challenges in Europe, which remains dependent on imports for its energy consumption.

While the prevailing outsider view now is that the ECB will not be cutting rates in June,it has been rare for Europe(i.e., the ECB and the Bundesbank pre-1999)to take the lead in pivoting into easing ahead of the FED. In fact, there have been only three occasions when the ECB has cut rates ahead of the FED in the modern era, and these wereall during periods when Europe was in a negative-rate regime. The other three times when the then Bundesbank cut ratesfirst were in the 1970s, after the 1987 crash, and during the recession caused by German reunification in the 1990s.

In the UK,March CPI slowed less than expected, with headline CPI at 3.2% YoY, driven partly by rising fuel prices. Despite having the worst inflation among the G7 post-Covid,the BOE is expected to pivot ahead of the FED, as the BOE will likely face a weaker economic environment and even more political pressures ahead of the incoming election. However,like the ECB, the BOE has been reluctant to jump the gun ahead of the FED on rate cuts, with only 3 instances over the past 50 years.

Outside the G10,weak domestic data in China, highlighted by this week's weak retail sales and industrial production, adds to therecent weak trade data in March. Chinese exports declined by 7.5% from a year earlier in March to $279.7 billion, falling far short of the median estimate of a 1.9% drop and sharply contrasting with the 7.1% growth in combined figures for January and February. This decline was attributed to a higher base in the same period last year, when China reported robust growth of 14.8% at $315.6 billion.Imports also slumped, sliding by 1.9% year-on-year in March, well below the Bloomberg consensus of a 1.0% increase. With exports collapsing, China'strade balance also slumped, dropping to just $58.6 billion in March, significantly worse than the Bloomberg consensus of $69.1 billion, and down from the January-February average balance of US$62.6 billion. Today's release of trade data only covers major trading partners and products.

In 2023, China saw its first decline in export growth in 7 years, dropping by 4.6% due to weak external demand. This posedadditional challenges for Beijing's efforts to revive the post-pandemic economy, alongside an exodus of foreign investment, waning market confidence, and potential trade barriers.The disappointing trade numbers exacerbated concerns for the world's second-largest economy, impacting the yuan's retreat, which aligns with China's desire for a weaker currency to boost exports. However, achieving this goal is proving difficult, with the yen falling to record lows against the yuan and breaching key support levels.

On the other hand, the dollar-yuan movement reflects diverging central bank policies. Without official yen support or a shift in FED rate cut expectations, Chinese authorities have limited options against a strengthening USD, especially with the PBOC expected to ease monetary policy. Despite attempts to defend the yuan and avoid capital outflows, China may ultimately resort todevaluing the currency. While Beijing has signalled commitment to yuan stability, a sudden 10% devaluation could occur anytime as it will probably help the economy by boosting exports. However, China faces a dilemma:maintain currency stability and lose out to a weakening yen, ordevalue the yuan to boost exports, risking significant capital outflows.

Spread between China & US 2-Year Yield (blue line); CNH/USD FX Rate (axis inverted; red line)

On a side note, while the Chinese economy has been apparently weak since the start of the Covid pandemic, not only didChina's crude oil imports hit a record high in 2023, breaking the previous record from 2020, butChina is also building up copper reserves. The most obvious reason could not be that China is stockpiling ahead of a possible extension of geopolitical tension in Asia, but most likely thatChina is looking to floodthe world, particularly Europe,with subsidized ‘magical mirrors’(i.e., solar panels),‘windmills’(i.e., wind turbines),and EVs.

The only currency, apart from the Peruvian sol which may have benefited from the rise in copper prices, that has appreciated against the USD this year is Gold. Gold's appreciation is attributed to its status asa hedge against government risks, primarily due toits ‘non-confiscatability’, which constitutes a significant portion of its value.

Throughout history, governments have confiscated investors' wealth through three main methods:

Monetary inflation, which stealthily erodes the real value of wealth over time.

Allowing the failure of banks and other financial institutionsthat hold investors' wealth.

The outright expropriation of wealth, as seen in historical events like the confiscation of properties in Europe in the 1930s.

Gold is ‘non-confiscatable’ in two of these scenarios:

Gold cannot be confiscated through inflation due to its controlled supply.

Gold cannot be confiscated through bank failure.

In a fiat monetary system, it is this ‘non-confiscatability’ of gold and because it isa hedge against government riskthat largely contributes to its value.

Much of Gold's value cannot be confiscated because it derives fromits physical properties. These include its inertness, which makes it highly coveted for jewellery that remains beautiful indefinitely, as well as its high electrical and thermal conductivity. However, other precious metals in Gold's vicinity on the periodic table, such as silver, platinum, and palladium, can substitute for gold's physical properties. Therefore, we can quantify the portion of gold's value that originates from its physical properties by considering itsrelative scarcity compared to silver(as indicated by the 'mining ratio') multiplied by the price of silver.

For centuries, the price of Gold primarily tracked its scarcity relative to silver multiplied by the price of silver. However, when the world transitioned to a fiat monetary system, first in 1931 after the collapse of the gold standard and again in 1971 after the collapse of the Bretton Woods 'pseudo gold standard',the price of gold surged well above its scarcity relative to silver.This serves as compelling evidence thatin a fiat monetary system, the dominant portion of gold's value arises from its non-confiscatability by banks or government’s failure.

2024-04-20 23:40:00,Israel Fostered The Rise Of Hamas To Preclude A Two-State Solution,https://web.archive.org/web/20240421105615/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/israel-fostered-rise-hamas-preclude-two-state-solution,"In Wednesday'sZeroHedge debate on Israel, Iran and Palestine, Dave Smith emphasized a little-known fact about the Gaza conflict -- thatIsrael ""cynically, intentionally funded and propped up"" Hamas""so they wouldn't face external pressure to give the Palestinians their freedom."" ViaBrian McGlinchey at Stark Realities, here's a deeper look at the history Smith wasreferring to.

In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by the Palestinian group Hamas, Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahudeclared, “The forces of civilization must support Israel in defeating Hamas…In fighting Hamas, Israel is not only fighting for its own people, it is fighting for every country that stands against barbarism.”

Those sentiments are quite different from ones Netanyahu privately sharedin 2019.

“Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas,”Netanyahu told Likud Party legislators, according toHaaretz, Israel's longest-running newspaper. Doing so would help prevent the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) from ruling Gaza and giving Palestinians a relatively moderate, unified voice at the negotiating table.“This is part of our strategy-- to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank.”

Israel’s reckless exploitation of Hamas is as old as the group itself.Indeed, decades before Netanyahu’s closed-door candor, the Israeli government pushed Hamas into its initial prominence, with direct and indirect financial support.

Throughout the 1970s, Israel’s nemesis was the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). In stark contrast to Hamas -- which emerged from the Muslim Brotherhood -- the PLO was a secular, leftist organization, led by Yasser Arafat, who headed the PLO’s Fatah faction.

As a former senior CIA official toldUPI’s Richard Salein 2001,Israel’s initial boosting of Hamas “was a direct attempt to divide and dilute support for a strong, secular PLOby using a competing religious alternative.""

Islamist groups began rising in prominence in Gaza in the wake of the 1967 War, as they undertook educational, cultural, social and infrastructure initiatives to make life better for Palestinian refugees there.

When it first registered with Israeli authoritiesin 1978, Hamas was led by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a half-blind, wheelchair-bound Muslim clericwho launched schools and clinics throughout Gaza.Israel backed his efforts, and alsoapprovedthe founding of the Islamic University of Gaza…which would become an extremist hub deemed worthy ofIsraeli bombs.

Israeli Brigadier General Yitzhak Segev, who was governor of Gaza and in frequent touch with Yassin, told theWall Street Journalthathe fully grasped Yassin’s ultimate aims -- to replace Israel with an Islamic state -- and the dangers of the Hamas ideology. However, at the time, Israel prioritized undermining the PLO-leading Fatah.

In the wake of Iran’s 1979 revolution that saw a secular, US-backed regime replaced with an Islamic republic,Hamas and other Islamists grew more popular, ambitious -- and violent. Regardless, Israel’s financial backing continued, a US intelligence source toldUPIin 2001, saying the support now had an additional rationale -- to gain intelligence and identify the most dangerous of Hamas members.

However,another US government official highlighted a far more sinister Israeli aim: to obliterate the chance for progress in resolving the Israel-Palestinian conflict. “The thinking on the part of some of the right-wing Israeli establishment was that Hamas and the other groups, if they gained control, would refuse to have anything to do with the peace process and would torpedo any agreements put in place,"" the officialsaid.

That would enable Israel to continue paying lip service to a two-state solution while disingenuously bemoaning its lack of a “partner for peace”on the Palestinian side. In the mean time, Israel would continue changing “facts on the ground” by demolishing Palestinian homes, authorizing more West Bank Israeli settlements and precluding the creation of a contiguous Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied territory.

In 2015, Bazalel Smotrich, leader of the Religious Zionist Party and now Israel’s finance ministersaid, “On the international playing field, in this game of the delegitimization…the PA is a liability and Hamas is an asset. It’s a terrorist organization. Nobody will recognize it,nobody will give it status at the [International Criminal Court] and nobody will let them push resolutions at the UN.”

“In the eyes of the Israeli right, the real threat to Israel is not Hamas’ violence and terrorism --the danger is a peace agreement…and the establishment of a Palestinian state,”wroteMeron Rapoport at Tel Aviv-based+972 Magazine.

Note that Hamas isn’t the only extremist group the Israeli right has shown a soft spot for. Under an earlier Netanyahu government,Israel gave medical assistance to wounded al-Qaeda membersand sent them back to fight the secular, Iran-aligned government in Syria…where their group wouldabduct, torture and murdercivilians too.Former Mossad chief Efraim HalevysaidIsrael’s aid was acceptable because “Al Qaeda, to the best of my recollection, has not attacked Israel.”

Before Oct. 7, referring to Hamas and Lebanon-based Hezbollah during a deposition for one of the corruption cases against him, Netanyahusaidsomething that showcased the Israeli right's overconfidence in its ability to manage extremists on its borders:

“We have neighbors who are bitter enemies…It’s impossible to reach an agreement with them…Everyone knows this, butwe control the height of the flames.”

They begin by discussing a recently leaked government project named ""Project Aqua"" which involves advanced aerospace vehicles and their interaction with humans, leading to medical injuries and even deaths.

""Here'swhat we know is that US servicemen have died as a result of contact with or being in the proximity of these vehiclesand we know that because there are a lot of suits working their way through the VA system.""

The conversation turns specifically to the nature of UFOs, suggesting they could be more than just physical or technological phenomena, potentially tied to spiritual or supernatural origins.

On supernatural explanations for UFOs:

""It'spretty clear to me that they're spiritual entitieswhatever that means are Supernatural and which is to saySupernaturals means above the natural above the observable uh nature.""

The troublesome twosome highlighted how certain revelations or events can lead to a deeper questioning of what is commonly accepted as truth, fostering a mindset of skepticism and curiosity.

On questioning assumptions:

""I began a process still ongoing of reassessing a lot of other things like okay well if that was not true what else is not true and what else that they told me was a conspiracy theory might actually have some basis in fact.""

Rogan reiterates his long-held fear of the potential for artificial intelligence to evolve beyond human control, transforming into a new form of life that could dramatically alter our understanding and existence.

On artificial intelligence and humanity's future:

""Digital Life it's going to give birth to a new life form and I think we're real close to that I think we're way closer than that to that than most people would ever want to admit.""

Carlson then opens up on his views about the current state of politics and society, particularly criticizing the dishonesty and manipulation in governmental and media structures.

The perennial topic of power corruption comes up next, with the two men comparing the intoxication of leadership to the historical behaviors of cult leaders and tyrants.

On power and control:

""It's very intoxicating and it's common in that it's always existed throughout human history. It's a thing that people do when they get power—they abuse the fuck out of it.""

On ideological indoctrination:

""Woke is clearly a cult; it's a mind virus... it's very similar to all kinds of religions... everybody has to believe very specific things and you can't differ from the doctrine.""

The pair elaborate further on the influence of ideologies that suppress dissenting views and the impact of governmental lies on public trust, emphasizing the importance of honesty in communication, slamming the government's tendency to prioritize power over transparency and the well-being of its citizens.

On the facade of democracy:

""When they stand up and pass a $60 billion funding bill for Ukraine when 70% of the population doesn't want it... and they call it a democracy, that will drive you insane because it's just too dishonest.""

On personal and governmental honesty:

""Maybe just assess everything that way - is someone lying? I don't care what your justification for it is... You can't participate in lying... try to tell the truth all the time.""

""You can't lie. You can't lie about anything, just don't lie about anything. Try to tell the truth all the time,"" he says.

""If you just stick with that, you get pretty quickly back to reason and order, don't you?""

Joe Rogan contunues by pointing out the themes of control and misinformation, particularly in the context of media, that are growuing more and more powerful. He points out the shift in what is considered mainstream media, highlighting the growing significance of platforms like Twitter and YouTube over traditional news outlets. Rogan stresses the increasing visibility of lies and the public's growing ability to discern truth from misinformation due to the accessibility of alternative information sources online.

On the problem with mainstream media:

""Mainstream media used to be CNN; it's not really anymore. Mainstream media is what in terms of the volume consumed, more people are consuming things on X [Twitter] than there are on anything else.""

The former Fox News host exclaims his clear disdain for the manipulation and deceit he perceives at the highest levels of power.

""This is not self-government. You don't run this country, we do. Shut up and obey,""says Carlson regarding what the reality of our government really is, adding that""what makes it particularly galling and hard to live with is when you call that system a democracy.""

Rogan and Carlson also touch upon the effects of technology and social media on personal interactions and societal norms. They discuss the negative impacts of constant connectivity, lamenting the loss of meaningful face-to-face interactions.

""When people lie and when people bullshit and gaslight, it's more offensive now than it's ever been before,""Rogan points out.

""The lies aren't sophisticated. It's something incredibly insulting and demeaning to tell me a lie when I know it's a lie.""

And then the discussion gets ominously dark as the pair reflect on the re-authorization of the 'spying on Americans' bill (we note that the two gentlemen met before the bill was re-authorized).

Stunningly, Carlson tells Rogan that congressmen were ""terrified"" that intelligence agencies will frame them with ""kiddie porn"" if they openly opposed the ""warrantless spying"" bill.

Specifically, he says US lawmakers ""told"" him that they are ""worried"" about being punished by intel agencies if they oppose reauthorizing Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

""People don't say that because they're worried about being punished. They’re worried about someone putting kiddie porn on their computer. Members of Congress are terrified of the intel agencies. I'm not guessing at that. They've told me that — including people on the intel committee, including people who run the intel committee,""Carlson said.

""The people whose job it is to oversee and keep in line these enormous, secretive agencies whose budgets we can't even know - their 'black budgets',"" Carlson continued, raising his hands into air-quotes.

That it is ""tyranny"", not democracy, for ""unelected people who are not accountable to anyone making the biggest decisions"",Carlson raged, to force congressmen to support reauthorizing ""warrantless spying"" of American citizens because ""they're threatened.""

""They're the parents, the agencies are the children. They're afraid of the agencies. That's not compatible with democracy.""

“It’s playing out in front of everyone, and no one cares and no one does anything about it,” Carlson said.

""I think the reason is because they’re threatened. And if you look at the committee chairman who allowed this shit to happen year after year,they’re all - and I don’t know, people say, ‘Oh, they’re compromised or being blackmailed,’ whatever. I don’t have evidence of that. But I know them. And they have all the things to hide. I know that for a fact.""

“It’s not a stretch of imagination to imagine that, you know, some committee chairman who’s allowing warrantless spying on Americans to continue, or whatever abuse they’re allowing...It’s not impossible to imagine that some guy with a drinking problem or a weird sex life — and that’s very common, very common up there — that’s why they’re doing it. Because they don’t want to be exposed,” Carlson added.

“I said to somebody, a very powerful person, the other day, in a conversation in my kitchen, an elected official - holds a really senior position...

But I was like, ‘All these people are controlled. They’ve all got weird s*x lives, and all these things they’re hiding, and they’re being blackmailed by the intel agencies.’

And he said, and I’m quoting, ‘I know.’ I was like, okay, so at this point, we’re just sort of admitting that’s real? Like, why do we allow that to continue?”

Joe Rogan Goes Quiet as Tucker Carlson Drops Bone-Chilling Reality“Members of Congress are terrified of the intel agencies. I’m not guessing at that. They’ve told me that, including people who run the intel committee.”What Tucker said next was even more revealing.“I said to…pic.twitter.com/yEjdxhxOp1

Finally, and in a more calming conclusion,Carlson reminisces about his unconventional childhood,emphasizing the value of communal meals and genuine conversations, which he contrasts starkly with the superficial interactions encouraged by social media platforms. Rogan agrees, but fears we have gone to far to ever be able to come back.

On the value of personal interaction:

""When you get people in a club and you take their phones away and just have them just be actual human beings and not be filming everything, just being completely trapped with this idea of capturing something and then putting it online, then you get to have a human experience."""
2024-04-21 22:45:00,Ukraine Gets Their Billions Despite CIA Director Reportedly Warning Zelenksy To Stop Stealing So Much Money,https://web.archive.org/web/20240422124458/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/ukraine-gets-their-billions-despite-cia-director-reportedly-warnings-zelenksy-stop#comment-stream,"Democrats cheered and waved Ukrainian flags, chanting ""Ukraine, Ukraine!""in some pavlovian response to Congress passing a bill that will send (another) $61 billion to Ukraine with no questions asked

Rand Paul, among many others, was incensed:

Ukrainian flags fly in the chamber of the UNITED STATES House of Representatives as they vote to send more of your hard-earned money to a corrupt foreign regime. And just like that they shout “UKRAINE! UKRAINE!”while happily working to secure Ukraine’s borders, not ours.pic.twitter.com/ZXZo1kliNl

This is the U.S. House of Representatives under the direction of Speaker Mike Johnson. Democrats are celebrating his total capitulation with no victory for securing our border.#MTVpic.twitter.com/TtaIgnX9eg

Ukrainian president Zelenskyy was very pleased, personally thinking Speaker Johnson

I am grateful to the United States House of Representatives, both parties, and personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the decision that keeps history on the right track.

Democracy and freedom will always have global significance and will never fail as long as America helps to protect it.

The vital U.S. aid bill passed today by the House will keep the war from expanding, save thousands and thousands of lives, and help both of our nations to become stronger. Just peace and security can only be attained through strength.

We hope that bills will be supported in the Senate and sent to President Biden’s desk. Thank you, America!

'War is Peace', America!

Today, we received the awaited decision on the US aid package that we long fought for. And a very significant one. Our warriors on the front lines, as well as our cities and villages suffering from Russian terror, will feel it.The U.S. House of Representatives voted on it…pic.twitter.com/G6z3PxsOMg

Of course he's pleased... why wouldn't he be, as who knows where that money will end up?

As Seymour Hersh recently reported,CIA Director Burns had to warn Zelensky to stop stealing so much money.

The issue of corruption was directly raised with Zelensky in a meeting last January in Kiev with CIA Director William Burns.

His message to the Ukrainian president, I was told by an intelligence official with direct knowledge of the meeting, was out of a 1950s mob movie.

The senior generals and government officials in Kiev were angry at what they saw as Zelensky’s greed, so Burns told the Ukrainian president, because “he was taking a larger share of the skim money than was going to the generals.”

Burns also presented Zelensky with a list of thirty-five generals and senior officials whose corruption was known to the CIA and others in the American government.

Zelensky responded to the American pressure ten days later by publicly dismissing ten of the most ostentatious officials on the list and doing little else.

“The ten he got rid of were brazenly bragging about the money they had—driving around Kiev in their new Mercedes,”the intelligence official told me.

Zelensky’s half-hearted response and the White House’s lack of concern was seen, the intelligence official added, asanother sign of a lack of leadership that is leading to a “total breakdown” of trust between the White House and some elements of the intelligence community.

Hersh went on to note that one estimate by analysts from the Central Intelligence Agency put theembezzled funds at $400 million last year,at least; another expert compared the level of corruption in Kiev as approaching that of the Afghan war,“although there will be no professional audit reports emerging from the Ukraine.”

But, remember, the first rule of sending money to corrupt Ukraine is... you don't talk about how corrupt Ukraine is (or you get impeached).

2024-04-21 23:20:00,The Intel Agencies Of Government Are Fully Weaponized,https://web.archive.org/web/20240422124458/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/intel-agencies-government-are-fully-weaponized,"Authored by 'sundance' via TheConservativeTreehouse.com,

Barack Obama and Eric Holder did not create a weaponized DOJ and FBI; instead, what they did was take the preexisting system and retool it so the weapons only targeted one side of the political continuum.  This point is where many people understandably get confused...

In the era shortly after 9/11, the DC national security apparatus was constructed to preserve continuity of government and simultaneously view all Americans as potential threats.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) were created specifically for this purpose.

What Barack Obama and Eric Holder did with that new construct was refine the internal targeting mechanisms so that only their ideological opposition became the target of the new national security system.  This is very important to understand as you dig deeper into this research outline.

Washington DC created the modern national security apparatus immediatelyand hurriedlyafter 9/11/01.  DHS came along in 2002, and within the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 the ODNI was formed.  When Barack Obama and Eric Holder arrived a few years later, those newly formed institutions were viewed as opportunities to create a very specific national security apparatus that would focus almost exclusively against their political opposition.

The preexisting Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Dept of Justice (DOJ) were then repurposed to become two of the four pillars of the domestic national security apparatus.  However, this new construct would have a targeting mechanism based on political ideology.The DHS, ODNI, DOJ and FBI became the four pillars of this new institution.Atop these pillars is where you will find theFourth Branch of Government.

We were not sleeping when this happened, we were wide awake.However, we were stunningly distracted by the economic collapse that was taking place in 2006 and 2007 when the engineers behind Obama started to assemble the design.  By the time Obama took office in 2009, we sensed something profound was shifting, but we can only see exactly what shifted in the aftermath.  The four pillars were put into place, and a new Fourth Branch of Government was quietly created.

As time passed, and the system operators became familiar with their new tools, technology allowed the tentacles of the system to reach out and touch us.That is when we first started to notice that something very disconcerting was happening.  Those four pillars are the root of it, and if we take the time to understand how the Fourth Branch originated, questions about this current state of perpetual angst will start to make sense.

Grab a cup of your favorite beverage, and take a walk with me as we outline how this was put together.  You might find many of the questions about our current state of political affairs beginning to make a lot more sense.

Remember, it is not my intent to outline the entire history of how we got to this place where the intelligence community now acts as the superseding fourth branch of government. Such an effort would be exhausting and likely take our discussion away from understanding the current dynamic.

History provided enough warnings from Dwight D. Eisenhower (military), to John F. Kennedy (CIA), to Richard Nixon (FBI), to all modern versions of warnings and frustrations from HPSCI Devin Nunes and ODNI Ric Grenell. None of those prior reference points are invalid, and all documented outlines of historic reference are likely true and accurate. However, a generational review is not useful, as the reference impacting us ‘right now‘ gets lost.

Instead, we pick up the expansive and weaponized intelligence system as it manifests after 9/11/01, and my goal is to highlight how the modern version of the total intelligence apparatus has now metastasized into a Fourth Branch of Government. It is this superseding branch that now touches and influences every facet of our life.

If we take the modern construct, originating at the speed of technological change, we can also see how the oversight or “check/balance” in our system of government became functionally obsolescent.

After many years of granular research about the intelligence apparatus inside our government, in the summer of 2020 I visited Washington DC to ask specific questions. My goal was to go where the influence agents within government actually operate, and to discover the people deep inside the institutions no one elected and few people pay attention to.

It was duringthis processwhen I discovered how information is purposefully put into containment silos; essentially a formal process to block the flow of information between agencies and between the original branches. While frustrating to discover, the silo effect was important because understanding the communication between networks leads to our ability to reconcile conflict between what we perceive and what’s actually taking place.

After days of research and meetings in DC during 2020; amid a town that was serendipitously shut down due to COVID-19; I found a letter slid under the door of my room in a nearly empty hotel with an introduction of sorts. The subsequent discussions were perhaps the most important. After many hours of specific questions and answers on specific examples, I realized why our nation is in this mess. That is when I discovered the fourth and superseding branch of government, the Intelligence Branch.

I am going to explain how the Intelligence Branch works:

(1) to control every other branch of government;

(2) how it functions as an entirely independent branch of government with no oversight;

(3) how and why it was created to be independent from oversight;

(4) what is the current mission of the IC Branch,

and most importantly (5) who operates it.

The Intelligence Branch is an independent functioning branch of government, it is no longer a subsidiary set of agencies within the Executive Branch as most would think. To understand the Intelligence Branch, we need to drop the elementary school civics class lessons about three coequal branches of government and replace that outlook with the modern system that created itself.

The Intelligence Branch functions much like the State Dept, through a unique set of public-private partnerships that support it. Big Tech industry collaboration with intelligence operatives is part of that functioning; almost like an NGO. However, the process is much more important than most think. In this problematic perspective of a corrupt system of government, the process is the flaw – not the outcome.

There are people making decisions inside this little known, unregulated and out-of-control branch of government that impact every facet of our lives.

None of the people operating deep inside the Intelligence Branch were elected, and our elected representative House members genuinely do not know how the system works. I assert this position affirmatively because I have talked to House and Senate staffers, including the chiefs of staff for multiple House & Senate committee seats. They are not malicious people; however, they are genuinely clueless of things that happen outside their silo. That is part of the purpose of me explaining it, with examples, in full detail with sunlight.

In April of 2016, the FBI launched a counterintelligence operation against presidential candidate Donald Trump. The questioning about that operation is what New York Representative Elise Stefanik cites in March of 2017, approximately 11 months later (First Two Minutes).

Notice how FBI Director James Comey just matter-of-factly explains no one outside the DOJ was informed about the FBI operation.Why? Because that’s just the way things are done. His justification for unilateral operations was “because of the sensitivity of the matter“, totally ignoring any constitutional or regulatory framework for oversight; because, well, quite simply, there isn’t any. The intelligence apparatus inside the DOJ/FBI can, and does, operate based on their own independent determinations of authority.

Notice also how FBI Director Comey shares his perspective that informing the National Security Council (NSC) is the equivalent of notifying the White House.The FBI leadership expressly believe they bear no responsibility to brief the Chief Executive. As long as they tell some unknown, unelected, bureaucratic entity inside the NSC, their unwritten responsibility to inform the top of their institutional silo is complete. If the IC wants to carve out the Oval Office, they simply plant information inside the NSC and, from their perspective, their civic responsibility to follow checks-and-balances is complete. This is an intentional construct.

Notice how Comey obfuscates notification to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), by avoiding the fact James Clapper was the DNI from outset of the counterintelligence operation throughout the remainder of Obama’s term.When I get deeper into the process, we will understand how the Intelligence Branch has intentionally used the creation of the DNI position (established post 9/11/01) as a method to avoid oversight, not enhance it. Keeping an oblivious doofus like James Clapper in position held strategic value [Doofus Reminder HERE].

That video of James Comey being questioned by Elise Stefanik was the first example given to me by someone who knew the background of everything that was taking place preceding that March 20, 2017, hearing. That FBI reference point is a key to understand how the Intelligence Branch operates with unilateral authority above Congress (legislative branch), above the White House (executive branch), and even above the court system (judicial branch).

Also, watch this short video of James Clapper because it is likely many readers have forgotten, and likely even more readers have never seen it.Watch closelyhow then White House national security adviser John Brennan is responding in that video.  This is before Brennan became CIA Director, this is when Brennan was helping Barack Obama put the pillars into place.WATCH:

[Sidebar: Every time I post this video it gets scrubbed from YouTube (example), so save it if you ever want to see it again.]

The video of James Clapper highlights how the ODNI position (created with good national security intention) ended up becoming the fulcrum for modern weaponization, and is now an office manipulated by agencies with a vested interest in retaining power. The Intelligence Branch holds power over the ODNI through their influence and partnership with the body that authorizes the power within it, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI).

Factually, the modern intelligence apparatus uses checks and balances in their favor. The checks create silos of proprietary information, classified information, vaults of information that work around oversight issues. The silos are part of the problem.

Ironically, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created in the aftermath of 9/11/01 expressly to eliminate the silos of information which they felt led to a domestic terrorist attack that could have been prevented. The ODNI was created specifically upon the recommendation of the 9/11 commission.

The intent was to create a central hub of intelligence information, inside the Executive Branch, where the CIA, NSA, DoD, DoS, and DIA could deposit their unique intelligence products and a repository would be created so that domestic intelligence operations, like the DOJ and FBI could access them when needed to analyze threats to the U.S. This, they hoped, would ensure the obvious flags missed in the 9/11 attacks would not be missed again.

The DNI office created a problem for those who operate in the shadows of proprietary information.You’ll see how it was critical to install a person uniquely skilled in being an idiot, James Clapper, into that willfully blind role while intelligence operatives worked around the office to assemble the Intelligence Branch of Government.

The last federal budget that flowed through the traditional budgetary process was signed into law in September of 2007 for fiscal year 2008 by George W. Bush. Every budget since then has been a fragmented process of continuing resolutions and individual spending bills.

Why does this matter? Because many people think defunding the Intelligence Community is a solution; it is not…. at least, not yet. Worse yet, the corrupt divisions deep inside the U.S. intelligence system can now fund themselves from multinational private sector partnerships (banks, corporations and foreign entities).

When Democrats took over the House of Representatives in January 2007, they took office with a plan. Nancy Pelosi became Speaker, and Democrats controlled the Senate where Harry Reid was Majority Leader. Barack Obama was a junior senator from Illinois.

Pelosi and Reid intentionally did not advance a budget in 2008 (for fiscal year 2009) because their plan included installing Barack Obama (and all that came with him) with an open checkbook made even more lucrative by a worsening financial crisis and a process called baseline budgeting. Baseline budgeting means the prior fiscal year budget is accepted as the starting point for the next year budget. All previous expenditures are baked into the cake within baseline budgeting.

Massive bailouts preceded Obama’s installation due to U.S. economic collapse, and massive bailouts continued after his installation. This is the ‘never let a crisis go to waste’ aspect. TARP (Troubled Asset Recovery Program), auto bailouts (GM), and the massive stimulus spending bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, ie. those shovel ready jobs) were all part of the non budget spending. The federal reserve assisted with Quantitative Easing (QE1 and QE2) as congress passed various Porkulous spending bills further spending and replacing the formal budget process.

Note: There has never been a budget passed in the normal/traditional process since September of 2007.

The people behind Obama, those same people now behind Joe Biden, knew from years of strategic planning that ‘radical transformation’ would require control over specific elements inside the U.S. government. Eric Holder played a key role in his position as U.S. Attorney General in the DOJ.

AG Holder recruited ideologically aligned political operatives who were aware of the larger institutional objectives. One of those objectives was weaponizing the DOJ-National Security Division (DOJ-NSD) a division inside the DOJ that had no inspector general oversight. For most people the DOJ-NSD weaponization surfaced with a hindsight awakening of the DOJ-NSD targeting candidate Donald Trump many years later. However, by then the Holder crew had executed almost eight full years of background work.

Carefully selecting fellow ideological travelers was facilitated by this filtration within the security clearance process. How does that issue later manifest?   Just look around at how politicized every intelligence agency has become, specifically including the FBI.

Through the Dept of State (DoS) the intelligence apparatus began working on their first steps to align Big Tech with a larger domestic institutional objective. Those of you who remember the “Arab Spring”, some say “Islamist Spring”, will remember it was triggered by Barack Obama’s speech in Cairo – his first foreign trip. The State Department worked with grassroots organizers (mostly Muslim Brotherhood) in Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Qatar and Libya. Obama leaned heavily on the organizational network of Turkish President Recep Erdogan for contacts and support.

Why does this aspect matter to us? Well, you might remember how much effort the Obama administration put into recruiting Facebook and Twitter as resources for the various mideast rebellions the White House and DoS supported. This was the point of modern merge between the U.S. intelligence community and Big Tech social media.

In many ways, the coordinated political outcomes in Libya and Egypt were the beta test for the coordinated domestic political outcomes we saw in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. intelligence community working with social media platforms and political operatives."

A London museum is facing backlash after it was revealed that a special ‘LGBTQ audio guide’ it is providing to visitors is claiming that the wife of King George III was mixed race.

The audio guide isbeing used in the Queen’s House in Greenwich, a publicly funded part of Royal Museums Greenwich.

Asection of the guidereferences a large golden sculpture of Queen Charlotte, claiming:“Queen Charlotte, the nation’s first royal person of colour.”

The guide then states“Yep, you heard me. The insecure white boys writing history conveniently forget to mention that bit, because… well, structural racism.”

A London museum is facing backlash due to an ‘LGBTQ audio guide’ (AUDIO BELOW) it is providing to visitors claiming that the wife of King George III was ""a person of colour"" and that it was covered up by racist historians. Report:https://t.co/XeP2nmTi8hpic.twitter.com/2Pczdq1tBj

There is no evidence at all that the queen, who was of German ancestry, was of any other heritage than white European.

Indeed, it appears that one basis for the claim may be that the Netflix seriesBridgertonand its spin off showQueen Charlottehas a mixed race actor playing the role of the queen.

The guide was created as part of a ‘LGBTQ history trail’ by a drag performer called Christian Adore, self described as a “homosexual historian” dedicated to unveiling “deliciously gay stories” from history.

Clearly there weren’t that many of those stories to relate on a tour of a royal residence dating back to the 1600s.

The guide also claims that King James I was bisexual and claims that Charles II had a “progressive, genuinely modern understanding of relationships in the 1660s” because he had a string of mistresses.

The report also notes that in one section of the audio guide a “migrant goddess” lectures  Lord Nelson about “moving over” and sharing his legacy of bravery with boat migrants who are “unsung heroes of the sea.”

When asked for an explanation, the Museum stated that the guide was “delivered by a number of performance artists, during LGBTQ+ History Month,” and intended to be “light-hearted entertainment.”

It added that the guide was originally part of an event called ‘Fierce Queens’ in which “we had a black performer playing Queen Charlotte, which is why this segment was included.”

2024-04-22 02:45:00,US-Funded Experiments In China Could Secretly Manipulate Viruses: Email,https://web.archive.org/web/20240422124458/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/us-funded-experiments-china-could-secretly-manipulate-viruses-email,"Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Experiments in China funded by the U.S. government could manipulate coronaviruses and leave no trace, according to newly disclosed emails.

Details of the experiments showed that changing the viruses could be done and “would leave no signatures of purposeful human manipulation,” an unknown person told the FBI on April 23, 2020, one of the emails showed.

The details were outlined on a webpage for a grant funded by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the agency headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci until late 2022. The government has funded $4.3 million for the grant. A portion of the funds were sent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a laboratory located in the same Chinese city in which the first COVID-19 cases appeared in 2019.

An FBI official forwarded the email to another FBI official about an hour after receipt. “Hey are you going to be in office tomorrow? We just interviewed our person from [redacted] again and he provided us with some alarming new info,” the official wrote. “Give me a call if you can.”

The identities of the source and FBI officials were redactedin the messages, which wereobtainedby the nonprofit Judicial Watch through a Freedom of Information Act request.

The FBI and EcoHealth did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

“These smoking gun documents showed the FBI quickly understood that Fauci’s agency funded the gain-of-function research that could disguise the resulting coronavirus as ‘natural,’” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement. “These new documents further demonstrate the need for a comprehensive criminal investigation into Fauci’s gain-of-function scandal.”

Robert Garry, who has a doctorate in microbiology and also studied virology, saidin private messagesthat genetic manipulation doesn’t leave signatures. One could “synthesize bits of the genes ... with perfect provision and then add them back in without a trace,” he wrote in early 2020 while analyzing COVID-19.

Mr. Garry and others later wrote in a paper called Proximal Origin that the available evidence showed COVID-19 “is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.” Two of the authorsdefendedthe change during a hearing in Congress.

Records previously obtained by Judicial Watch showed that the FBI opened an inquiry into the research in Wuhan, which was done under a grant called “Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence.”

It’s not clear what specific actions the FBI took but the bureau has since determined that COVID-19, a coronavirus, likely originated at the Wuhan lab.

“You’re talking about a potential leak from a Chinese government-controlled lab that killed millions of Americans,” FBI Director Christopher Wraysaid in 2023.

The U.S. intelligence community as a whole is divided on the matter, with at least one other agency also assessing a lab origin as likely while others are undecided or lean towards the natural origin theory.

COVID-19 is believed to have come from bats. The grant gave money to scientists to gather bat coronaviruses and experiment on them in labs in Wuhan and elsewhere. China has largely blocked investigations into the origins of COVID-19 and declined to make information from the lab public. Similarities between COVID-19 and a virus on which experiments were proposed in a separate EcoHealth funding application are among the evidence pointing to the lab leak theory, experts say. Others say the available evidence, including early cases at a wet market in Wuhan, suggest a natural origin.

Experiments funded through the U.S. grant did result in a bat coronavirus that made mice sicker than those infected with the original version, government officialshave disclosed. Concerns about work at the lab were raised prior to the pandemic, according toan internal reportviewed recently by a U.S. senator. OfficialsrenewedEcoHealth’s grant in 2023 but havebarredfunding to the Wuhan lab after lab leaders stopped sharing information with EcoHealth and U.S. overseers.

“We’ve made very clear to China -- and many other countries have as well -- that they should not be supplying Russia with weapons for use in its aggression against Ukraine,” said Secretary of State Blinken after a meeting of G-7 foreign ministers.

“It’s allowing Russia to continue the aggression against Ukraine and it’s also helping Russia overall rebuild its defense forces and defense capacity,” he said, as America works to hold the West together, while it manages its slow inward turn, and each major economic block scrambles to secure itself, as the geopolitical gears grind onward, on a little planet that is tearing itself apart.

“In a benign international environment, we trusted the global level playing field and the rules-based international order, expecting that others would do the same. But now the world is changing rapidly, and it has caught us by surprise,” said Mario Draghi, former European Central Bank Chief, speaking at the High-level Conference on the European Pillar of Social Rights.

“Most importantly, other regions are no longer playing by the rules and are actively devising policies to enhance their competitive position.At best, these policies are designed to re-direct investment towards their own economies at the expense of ours; and at worst, they are designed to make us permanently dependent on them,” said Draghi, sounding an existential alarm on Europe.

“China, for example, is aiming to capture and internalize all parts of the supply chain in green and advanced technologies and is securing the access to the required resources. This rapid supply expansion is leading to significant overcapacity in multiple sectors and threatening to undercut our industries,” he said.

“The US, for its part, is using large-scale industrial policy to attract high-value domestic manufacturing capacity within its borders– including that of European firms – while using protectionism to shut out competitors and deploying its geopolitical power to re-orient and secure supply chains,” he said.

“We have never had an equivalent “Industrial Deal” at the EU level, even though the Commission has been doing everything in its power to fill this gap. As such, despite a number of positive initiatives that are underway, we are still lacking an overall strategy for how to respond in multiple areas,” said Mario.

“We are lacking a strategy for how to keep pace in an increasing cutthroat race for leadership in new technologies.Today we invest less in digital and advanced technologies than the US and China, including for defense, and we only have four global European tech players among the top 50 worldwide,” he warned, articulating the reasons why Europe is becoming even less relevant.

“We are lacking a strategy for how to shield our traditional industries from an unlevel global playing field caused by asymmetries in regulations, subsidies and trade policies,” saidDraghi, desperate to do whatever it takes, unlikely to make a difference.

To gain perspective on this long-term trend,Visual Capitalist's Marcu Lu visualizedthe debt-to-GDP ratios of advanced economies, as of 2000 and 2024 (estimated). All figures were sourced from the IMF’sWorld Economic Outlook.

The data we used to create this graphic is listed in the table below. “Government gross debt” consists of all liabilities that require payment(s) of interest and/or principal in the future.

The debt-to-GDP ratio indicates how much a country owes compared to the size of its economy, reflecting its ability to manage and repay debts. Percentage point (pp) changes shown above indicate the increase or decrease of these ratios.

Japan(+116 pp),Singapore(+86 pp), and theU.S.(+71 pp) have grown their debt as a percentage of GDP the most since the year 2000.

All three of these countries have stable, well-developed economies, so it’s unlikely that any of them will default on their growing debts. With that said, higher government debt leads to increased interest payments, which in turn can diminish available funds for future government budgets.

This is a rising issue in the U.S., where annual interest payments on the national debt havesurpassed $1 trillionfor the first time ever.

Among this list of advanced economies,Belgium(-2.8 pp),Iceland(-21.2 pp), andIsrael(-20.6 pp) were the only countries that decreased their debt-to-GDP ratio since the year 2000.

According toFitch Ratings, Iceland’s debt ratio has decreased due to strong GDP growth and the use of its cash deposits to pay down upcoming maturities.

Curious to see which countries have the most government debt in dollars? Check outthis graphicthat breaks down $97 trillion in debt as of 2023.

2024-04-22 05:00:00,How Trust (Or The Lack Of It) Affects America's Trajectory,https://web.archive.org/web/20240422124458/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/how-trust-or-lack-it-affects-americas-trajectory,"America’s trust in its institutions has rapidlyeroded over the past 20 years.

We have a lower level of trust in our judicial system and elections than most European countries.Some of this is natural, as Americans are uniquely individualistic, but much of it arises from repeated government failures.

Americans generally believe thatpublic trust can be brought back to full vigor, but the current trend of decline has not slowed. While governmental distrust is often well-grounded, a concerning increase in distrust has been seen among citizens. America’s ever-dwindling amount of freedom originally thrust great responsibility onto the citizens. With less institutional control, citizens had to both act with goodwill and hold the expectation that their countrymen were beneficent.More free-market solutions meant that citizens had to trust word of mouth and relationships rather than institutional certification.The most basic building blocks of industry would have ceased to function if Americans had refused to trust one another. The shared pursuit of individual aims under an institutional framework that explicitly limited itself arguably created more willing cooperation than any other civilization. Some have credited this high level of trust to America’s relative cultural homogeneity at the time of its founding. While a more similar cultural and religious background certainly aided the budding country, ingenuity and prosperity arose from the diversity that freedom created. Americans were able to trust one another and their institutions even as they thought and worshiped differently.America’s rejection of its trust-filled pastcan both reform our institutions and destroy our strength of commerce.

Trust’s ability to allow trade between strangers has been slowly encroached upon by government licensing agencies.In the past, individuals could simply ask a friend whether a cosmetologist or barber was competent. The reputational costs of being a poor barber would not allow horrid haircuts to continue. Individuals would simply stop paying, and the “barber” would have to seek a more fitting profession. The great increase in professional licenses has replaced personal trust with governmental approval. In a self-reinforcing cycle, licenses keep being created and untrusting consumers are glad to see more professions licensed. Licensing processes often give valuable skills, but those same skills would have been sought out regardless if they were truly valuable. While the recent increase in licensing and certification is partially due to the recent population growth of bureaucrats, it also reflectsthe attitude of the American public.Moral degradation has made many citizens unworthy of trust, and they see the same worrisome tendencies in citizens around them.Certifications and licenses act as a bandage to the severely injured state of national trust. The reason such measures are only a bandage rather than a treatment is that trust will never be fully replaceable. Its versatility allows it to smooth interactions between industries and people far more delicately than regulation could ever hope to. Nonetheless, trust continues to be replaced as many individuals find more security in the choices of bureaucrats they will never even hear the names of.

An immobile and ancient boundary post stands in the way of governmental encroachment. Individual distrust of government urged Americans to revolt from Britain, and it remains a challenge to the desires of bureaucrats and the fears of those who would be regulated.Just as distrust of other citizens damages free commerce, so also distrust of government damages its ability to control.This distrust manifests itself in the ballot box, civic monitoring of governmental activity, and theaccrual of assets not tied to governmental control. Distrusters can look above the pandering of bread and circuses to investigate what self-serving inefficiency is masked behind. While its coercive power remains regardless of the actions of individual citizens, distrust cripples one of the government’s strongest means of control: information.When government-given information is put under scrutiny truth can be cherished more strongly and falsehood can be promptly discarded.The opinion of whichever government employee wrote a specific piece of “objective information” can be drawn out of it through careful analysis. Those who have complete trust in the government enter a self-reinforcing cycle which makes it ever harder for their minds to break the grasp of state control.

Trust in other citizens and trust in the state may appear similar at first glance, but they lead to vastly different national outcomes.Rejectinggoodwill and cooperation directly before our eyesin favor offaceless securitywill lead to economic and national ruin.No amount of regulation can ever replace the goodwill and trust that is at the core of American identity and success.

2024-04-22 05:45:00,Commercial Real Estate Foreclosures Soar To Levels Not Seen In Nearly A Decade,https://web.archive.org/web/20240422124458/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/commercial-real-estate-foreclosures-soar-levels-not-seen-nearly-decade,"Larger cracks are appearing in the US commercial real estate market at a time when uncertainty around the regional bank industry flashes red.

The latest report from real estate data providerATTOMshows CRE foreclosures topped 625 in March, up 6% from February and 117% from the same period last year.

ATTOM has been tracking commercial foreclosures since 2014. The number of foreclosures is approaching the peak of 889 in October 2014.

""California began experiencing a notable rise in commercial foreclosures in November 2023, surpassing 100 cases and continuing to escalate thereafter,"" the report said.

New York, Florida, Texas, and New Jersey also showed increases in CRE foreclosures last month.

Regional banks provide a bulk of the financing for the space. The ongoing mess in the lending space due to tighter conditions adds pressure to the CRE downturn. Banks are expected to set aside more money to cover potential CRE losses.

Last month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified on Capitol Hill, ""We have identified the banks that have high commercial real estate concentrations, particularly office and retail and other ones that have been affected a lot,"" adding, ""This is a problem that we'll be working on for years more, I'm sure. There will be bank failures, but not the big banks.""

Data from a recent Treasury Department's Financial Stability Oversight Council warned office vacancy rates have climbed sharply in recent years, reaching a record of 13.1% at the end of 2023.

CoStar analyst Phil Mobley recently noted the ""reset in office demand has rocked US markets.""

Morgan Stanley warned earlier this year that office prices could plunge 30% due to sliding demand.

With sliding demand comes a massive amount of supply. Morgan Stanley pointed out that most of theoversupply is in offices and apartments.

For those wondering why the excess supply of office towers can't be converted into affordable housing, Goldman also noted that prices must drop 50% forhousing conversions to make sense.

Powell has a rolling crisis on his hands. And the goal is to save the fireworks for after the election.

2024-04-22 06:30:00,The Three Oil And Gas Stocks Most Sensitive To Oil Price Swings,https://web.archive.org/web/20240422124458/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/three-oil-and-gas-stocks-most-sensitive-oil-price-swings#comment-stream,"By Alex Kimani ofOilPrice

Following a strong rally amid escalating tensions in the Middle East, oil prices have pulled back sharply in the current week as demand worries outweigh geopolitical concerns. WTI crude forMay deliveryhas declined 5.1% from the Friday close to trade at $83.15 per barrel while Brent crudeJune contracthas retreated 4.9% to change hands at $87.50, marking the first time it has slipped under $90 in more than a week.

However,several commodity analysts believe the markets are unduly discounting the risk of a full-blown war between Iran and Israel.According to Standard Chartered, Iran’s revised position is that any future attacks on Iranian interests anywhere will draw significant retaliation, with the IRGC seizure of a cargo ship on 13 April intended as a related signal of Iran’s ability to influence regional shipping flows. StanChart has warned that the market is understating the risk of further escalation due to miscalculation, miscommunication or other human error. Meanwhile, oil prices have declined after U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson lined up four bills providing assistance to Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific. Bank of America estimates that an all-out war between the two countries could lead to a $30-$40spike in the price of crude.

""The market was waiting to sell off on indications of calming of tensions in the Middle East ... progress on these bills and a three-day delay in Israel's response to Iran is helping today,"" John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC, told CNBC.

""We're leaving our price forecasts unchanged for now and still expect ICE Brent to average US$96 over the second half of this year. The macro outlook continues to be a more important driver for prices than fundamentals at the moment,"" analysts at ING have said.

Bank of America has analyzed stocks in the MSCI AC World Index (ACWI) Energy, Materials and Industrials sectors for oil price sensitivity. BofA defines Oil Price Sensitivity for each stock as the regression coefficient from regressing 60 months of monthly price returns against the 3-month change in the Oil Price - Brent Crude. Here are 3 of the most sensitive oil and gas stocks to oil price changes.

12-Month Returns: -17.9%

APA Corp.(NASDAQ:APA) is an independent energy company. It explores, develops and produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. At a time when the oil sector has been rallying, APA stock has managed to decline nearly 20% over the past 12 months, and was themost shortedenergy name in March.

That said, back in January,Fitch affirmedits 'BBB- credit rating for APA Corp, saying, “The $4.5 billion acquisition of Permian pure play Callon Petroleum should improve APA Corp's business profile by adding scale to the company's Permian operations. Callon will contribute 145k net acres in the Permian, split between the Delaware (82%) and Midland basins (18%), with Delaware acreage primarily in Ward, Reeves, and Winkler counties. The acquisition also adds 102kboepd of Permian production, boosting APA's pro forma size by around one-quarter to over 500kboepd, and increasing its portfolio tilt towards the U.S.’’

Further, APA holds a 50% stake in Suriname’s Block 58 alongside operatorTotalEnergies(NYSE:TTE). Block 58. The block has been compared to the Guyana-Suriname basin, with analysts comparing it to Exxon Mobil”s (NYSE:XOM) Liza find in the Stabroek Block.

12-Month Returns: 11.2%

Marathon Oil Corp.operates the United State's largest refining system, with 3 million barrels per calendar day of crude oil refining capacity across 13 refineries. Recently, equity analysts at Goldman Sachs, headed by Jenny Ma, picked MRO amongst a basket of stocks expected to benefit from high operating leverage, adding that companies with a high degree of operating leverage can generate more sales without increasing their costs. MRO has an operating leverage of 6.9.

However, JPMorgan has picked MRO stock thanks to anattractive call overwriting opportunity,

“The call overwriting signal will be triggered if the sell signals are greater than the buy signal, and if the volume richness signals are greater than the cheapness signals,” they said.

12-Month Returns: 45.6%

Texas-basedTarga Resources Corp.(NYSE:TRGP) owns general and limited partner interests in a limited partnership that provides midstream natural gas and natural gas liquid services. The company gathers, compresses, treats, processes, and sells natural gas. On Tuesday, TRGP was one of the stocks that earned a Buy recommendation from Goldman Sachs thanks to a strong return on equity (or ROE).

“Stronger-than-expected economic growth represents the clearest upside risk to ROE. [It] would create upside to asset turnover through faster sales growth and to profit margins through operating leverage. Stronger growth has recently coincided with hotter-than-expected inflation, however,” wrote GS analyst David J. Kostin. “

GS estimates that Targa Resources will be able to grow its ROE by 17% in the current year.

2024-04-22 06:55:00,Americans Struggle The Most In Cities Controlled By Radical Democrats,https://web.archive.org/web/20240422124458/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/americans-struggle-most-cities-controlled-radical-democrats,"A new Census Bureau survey highlights the 15 largest US metro areas where residents face the most financial difficulties, almost all of which are under Democratic leadership. This comes as no surprise as issues of elevated inflation, high taxes, soaring violent crime, and a migrant crisis are spiraling out of control across many blue cities.

The survey asked 70,000 respondents between March 5 and April 1 in major metro areas these three questions:

Difficulty paying for usual household expenses,

and unable to pay energy bill.

The survey's findings are stark: Riverside, California; Houston, Texas; and Chicago, Illinois, are the top three metro areas with the most financial hardships. All three cities are under Democratic leadership. With the exception of Dallas (#4 on the list) and Miami (#6), the rest of the metro areas are under liberal control.

In addition to the Census Bureau, the latest Beige book from the Federal Reserve found that consumer spending ""barely increased"" amid weakness in discretionary spending. The consumer is a lot weaker than the White House makes everyone believe with needless propaganda pushed on social media and at press conferences.

Consumers are bearing the brunt of failed Bidenomics: reckless federal spending, disastrous green initiatives, and horrible foreign policy have created a toxic environment for consumers. And now inflation is on the rise.

The takeaway here is to leave blue cities.

This is Philadelphia. A city that’s been run by democrat’s for ages.People there are using drugs that are turning them into zombies.This is what is coming to your city if you keep voting for democratspic.twitter.com/Xdjrb9U7TG

How did they allow Philadelphia to get this bad?pic.twitter.com/9FkNsxkfMJ

These Democrats refuse to look at the consequences of their actions.This is what happens when one party rule takes over, and their job becomes how to keep their jobNo longer by the people, for the people, and of the peoplepic.twitter.com/XRP5CwmhkA

The implosion is only going to get worse.

2024-04-22 07:20:00,When Will The Yen Carry Trade End?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240422124458/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/when-will-yen-carry-trade-end#comment-stream,"Decades of negative interest rate policy in Japan have ended.

That could mean the end of the $20 trillion “yen carry trade,” once one of the most popular trades on foreign exchange markets, and a chain reaction in the global economy.

The yen carry trade is when investors borrow yen to buy assets denominated in higher-yielding foreign currencies, like the USD, where interest rates are higher.

Even now thatthe BoJ is hiking rates, interest rates in Japan are still low, and will remain as such- the economy can’t handle too high of an uptick too fast after becoming dependent on NIRP. But the moment rates were raised above zero, the yen carry trade instantly became a far riskier gamble.

The yen has recently weakened against the dollar, keeping the carry trade attractive for now.

But if the BoJ starts dumping US Treasurys, sending yields up, and sacrificing stocks, a vicious cycle begins where the dollar strengthens against the yen to the point of the yen becoming practically worthless.

USD vs Yen, March 18 – April 17

Of course, it’s all relative. The yen is weak against the dollar, but with rampant inflation, the dollar is losing value too — just not as fast.When the media tells you the dollar is currently strong, what they’re really saying is that it’s strong compared to even weaker currencies. AsPeter Schiff saidon his podcast earlier this week:

“Part of what’s masking this problem is the relative strength of the dollar. And I say ‘relative’ because the dollar is actually weak. Gold tells you what’s actually happening: gold today hit a new all-time record high in every single currency…gold tells you the dollar is down. What the rising dollar index tells you in an environment of a rising gold price is that the dollar is losing value.”

As it is, foreign exchange markets make traders money without adding any real value. With a global monetary standard where each country’s currency is pegged tothe price of gold, there wouldn’t be the same opportunity to trade on the short-term fluctuations across different currencies, the supply and borrowing cost of each one determined by a central authority. Foreign exchange markets could still exist, but their appeal would be drastically diminished.

Since they essentially allow traders to harvest profitswithout investing in or creating anything of actual material value, one is left wondering if all that capital would end up flowing into more productive ventures. Carry trades also rely on leveraged bets, which when they blow up, blow up hard.

Speaking of blowing up, theconflict in the Middle Eastjust keeps getting worse, with a standoff between Iran and Israel threatening to go nuclear (perhaps literally) and drag in more foreign intervention. If oil spikes too hard against the yen, and the BoJ panics to save it, it could lead to a global margin call that begins a domino effect of imploding stock prices and a widespread economic collapse.

The BoJ has to letbond yields riseto counteract the weakening yen, bringing investors back to buying Japanese debt and pushing up bond yields in the US and EU.That means higher interest payments in the US and EU in the short term, which can only be paid with more borrowed money, creating a vicious feedback loop that stands to reveal the fundamental insolvency of major national economies.

Decade-long highs for Japanese Bond Yields 🇯🇵pic.twitter.com/vkzdr1iThH

Every action has an equal and opposite reaction — but when you’releveraged to the gills, that reaction isn’t equal, it’s drastically magnified.Enough traders overcompensating at once can have disastrous effects in any market, but even more so when they’re trading with massive leverage.

With rate cuts still on the table (for now) in the US this year, the viability of the yen carry trade will be further eroded, narrowing the gap between interest rates on the two currencies.

The yen is becoming more volatile, and choppy Forex markets make carry trades risky since they rely on a predictable gap on the value and cost of borrowing between currencies.

And if the yen carry trade fully unwinds, the blow-up could be spectacular enough totake other parts of the economy outwith it.

2024-04-22 07:45:00,Sam Altman Powers Up America With Clean Energy Startup Investment,https://web.archive.org/web/20240422124458/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/sam-altman-powers-america-clean-energy-startup-investment#comment-stream,"Sam Altman and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz are betting on solar power and energy storage that can supply a low-carbon future to artificial intelligence data centers. Altman, the face of the AI chatbot boom, has also invested in nuclear power technology to fuel America's powering up with clean, reliable energy.

The Wall Street Journalreports that Altman and the private US venture capital firm are among the investors putting $20 million into Exowatt, a company that aims to solve the clean-energy needs of AI data centers.

Exowatt declined to provide details about how its technology works. However, WSJ provided a brief understanding:

Instead of solar panels arrayed across a field, Exowatt has developed modules roughly the size of shipping containers that contain solar lenses. The lenses convert energy from the sun into heat. That heat can then be used to warm up cheap, basic materials much like electricity heats up a toaster, allowing the modules to store energy for up to 24 hours a day.

The goal is to take advantage of the cost reductions from storing energy as heat. To produce electricity, the module passes the heat through an engine. Many other companies are working on different approaches to solar and low-cost heat batteries, but Exowatt says it is unique because it combines them in one unit.

The problem with solar power generation is that the sun only sometimes shines. For grid stability, solar and wind are fine, but nuclear power will have to be the primary reliable source of clean energy. We've been a bull on nuclear power (read: here) and recently showed readers how there's a historic reversal underway in nuclear power in the US (read: here).

Clearly, Altman understands this. He recently backed nuclear power startup Oklo and Helion.

""Fundamentally today in the world, the two limiting commodities you see everywhere are intelligence, which we're trying to work on with AI, and energy,"" Altman told CNBC in 2021.

It's becoming clear that the aging US power grid won't be able to support the surge in AI data centers and the electrification of the economy. In""The Next AI Trade,"" we outlined investment opportunities for powering up America.

Meanwhile, theupfront costs of upgrading the nation's power grid aresparking out-of-control power billcosts for households, as many folks have trouble paying monthly bills.

2024-04-22 08:10:29,"Futures Rebound As Geopolitical Fears Fade, Fed Enters Blackout Period",https://web.archive.org/web/20240422124458/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/futures-rebound-geopolitical-fears-fade-fed-enters-blackout-period,"US equity futures rose, putting the S&P on pace for its first gain after 6 straight days of losses, as focus shifted from Middle East tensions to a raft of company earnings this week, including four of the Mag7 tech megacaps which got hammered last week. At 7:40am, S&P emini futures gained about 0.5% after the index recorded its worst week since March 2023; Nasdaq futures were 0.6% higher while Europe was green across the board. Demand for havens eased as traders took comfort from the absence of further escalation from Iran following Israel’s retaliatory strike. A Bloomberg dollar index was steady as geopolitical tensions eased and the Fed entered a blackout period before its May 1 policy decision, while the yield on 10-year US Treasury yields rose three basis points. Oil reversed an earlier slide while gold dropped around 1.4% as demand for haven assets fades.

In premarket trading, Nvidia rebounded almost 3% after the artificial intelligence favorite shed nearly $212 billion of its market capitalization in Friday’s broad tech selloff. Salesforce rose 3.6% after Bloomberg reported that takeover talks with Informatica have cooled. Retail wireless provider Verizon advanced after an earnings beat. On the downside, Tesla, which is set to report earnings on Tuesday, dropped 3% as the automaker’s decision over the weekend to slash prices across its range in China risks sparking another round in the nation’s bruising electric-vehicle price war. Here are some other notable premarket movers:

Even though a military base in Syria belonging to a US-led coalition came under rocket-fire late on Sunday, in the first attacks against US bases in the Middle East since early February, the lack of further escalation between Isreal and Iran eased fears about military conflict in the Middle East accelerating.

“We are seeing a relief rally underway this morning as geopolitical risks subside,”said Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne. “The move basically squares the ledger now and allows the markets to go back to focus on macroeconomic and corporate fundamentals.""

Robust earnings from corporate America are expected to pull the S&P 500 Index out of its latest morass, despite rising concerns about a significant jump in bond yields, according to Bloomberg’s latest Markets Live Pulse survey. Nearly two-thirds of 409 respondentssaid they expect earnings to give the US equity benchmark a boost.That’s the highest vote of confidence for corporate profits since the poll began asking the question in October 2022.

Profits for the seven biggest growth companies in the S&P 500 — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia Corp., Meta and Tesla — are on course to surge 38% in the first quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. When excluding them, the rest of the benchmark index’s profits are anticipated to shrink by 3.9%.

Traders are also recalibrating their positions after a solid run of US data forced the Fed to reset the clock on its first interest rate cut. Data prints later in the week are likely to help finesse policy bets,with both US growth and the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation due.

In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 gained about 0.4%, recovering some of last week’s slide as retail and personal care sectors leading gains, while automobiles & parts as well as utilities shares are the biggest laggards. Prosus NV shares jumped as much as 5% as Tencent, in which it is a major shareholder, rallied after nailing down an earlier-than-anticipated debut of one of the year’s most eagerly-awaited mobile games. Among other individual movers, Galp Energia SGPS SA surged as much as 19% after the Portuguese oil company provided an update on a commercial oil find off the coast of Namibia. Sandoz Group AG climbed more than 4% to a record after the Swiss pharma company confirmed the European Commission’s approval of its Pyzchiva psoriasis drug. Here are the biggest movers Monday:

Earlier in the session, Asian stocks rose, with gains in Hong Kong on Beijing’s latest market support measures helping offset declines in tech hardware shares. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.1%, with Tencent and Alibaba among the biggest boosts. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index jumped 1.8%, with notable gains also seen in Japan, Australia and South Korea. Chinese regulators announced five measures to optimize stock connects and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a financial hub. That helped improve sentiment along with the absence of further escalation in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Meanwhile, chip and AI shares declined after Nvidia’s biggest drop in four years drove US stocks lower Friday.

In FX, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is flat while the antipodean currencies top the G-10 FX pile, rising 0.3% versus the greenback respectively. The Australian and New Zealand dollars climbed as fast-money funds continued short-covering that began in London on Friday, according to Asia-based FX traders. There could be temporary relief on the horizon from the recent volatility in currencies as there has already been “a considerable scaling back of Fed rate cut expectations,” according to Paul Mackel, global head of FX strategy at HSBC Holdings Plc. “It is hard to think Friday’s US PCE data will change this picture much,” he wrote in a note to clients.

In rates, Treasuries are slightly cheaper across the curve, following similar losses across European rates as demand for haven assets fades in the absence of major escalation in Middle East conflict. Meanwhile,investors are looking ahead to a heavy slate of Treasury and corporate new-issue supply this week.US long-end yields are higher by as much as 3.5bp on the day, with 2s10s and 5s30s spreads steeper by 2.4bp and 1.2bp as front-end outperforms;10-year around 4.66% is 4bp cheaper on the day with bunds lagging by additional 1bp in the sector.

A hefty slate of Treasuries auctions will be a major test of whether yields have peaked for the year.  Higher-than-expected interest rates amid persistent inflation are perceived as the biggest threat to financial stability among market participants and observers, the Fed said in its semiannual Financial Stability Report published Friday.

In commodities, Brent fell 0.6% to trade near $86.70 while spot gold falls 1.8% to around $2,342/oz. Treasuries dip as investors look ahead to a hefty slate of auctions. US 10-year yields rise 3bps to 4.65%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is flat while the antipodean currencies top the G-10 FX pile, rising 0.3% versus the greenback respectively. Bitcoin rises 2%.

Bitcoin climbs higher post-halving and now holds just above USD 66k; Ethereum also firmer and back at 3.2k.

Looking at today's calendar, US economic data slate includes March Chicago Fed national activity index at 8:30am; ahead this week are April preliminary PMIs, March new home sales and durable goods orders, first estimate of 1Q GDP, and March personal income and spending (with PCE deflator). Fed members have entered quiet period ahead of May 1 policy announcement.

APAC stocks were mostly positive following the lack of any major geopolitical escalations over the weekend.ASX 200 was underpinned amid gains in nearly all sectors and with the advances initially led by outperformance mining stocks as copper prices approached closer to the USD 10,000/ton level and with firm gains in South32 following its quarterly output update.Nikkei 225 gained but is well off intraday highs after the index briefly wiped out all its earlier spoils before recovering again with price action choppy after last Friday's comments from BoJ Governor Ueda who suggested a hike is very likely if underlying inflation increases.Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp. were mixed in which the latter outperformed with strength in biopharma, tech and consumer stocks front-running the gains in the index. Conversely, the mainland lagged amid US-China frictions after the US House passed a bill that could lead to a total TikTok ban, while China's benchmark Loan Prime Rates were maintained at their current levels, as expected.

European bourses are mixed, Stoxx 600 (+0.2%), having initially opened with a clear positive bias. In catalyst-thin trade, equities have ebbed lower, and off best levels, though generally hold a positive bias.European sectors are mostly positive; Retail is found at the top of the pile after Jefferies upgraded several Cos from within the sector. Autos are the clear underperformer, after Tesla (-3.2% pre-market) cut prices for some of its models, as such, European peers are suffering. US Equity Futures (ES +0.4%, NQ +0.5%, RTY +0.6%) are entirely in the green, with the NQ and ES attempting to pare back some of the hefty losses seen in the prior session. Elsewhere, UBS downgraded Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) to Neutral from Overweight

Geopolitics: Middle East

DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap

It's a bit of a messy picture for markets at the moment with huge uncertainty around events in the Middle East, US tech seeing its biggest sell-off for around 18 months, and with yields climbing as rate cuts gets increasingly pushed out. The lack of further escalations in tensions over the weekend in the Iran and Israel situation is helping Asia get off to a better start this morning though.

In terms of this week, we’ll have to wait for Friday for the main macro event namely the US core PCE print within the income and spending report. Our economists expect the core PCE deflator to come in at +0.30% vs. +0.26% last month. This would drop the YoY rate to 2.7% but within a whisker of rounding up to 2.8%, a level that both Chair Powell and Vice Chair Jefferson suggested that the Fed staff’s estimate had pencilled in.

In equity markets all eyes will be on earnings with a whopping 178 of the S&P 500 reporting including four of the Magnificent Seven namely Tesla (after Tuesday’s close), Microsoft, Alphabet (Thursday) and Meta (Wednesday). The final three are the 1st, 4th and 6th largest S&P 500 firms by market cap and make up nearly 14% of its market cap. Tesla is down -41% YTD and under a lot of pressure so it’s an important release for them. This all comes off the back of the worst week for the S&P 500 (-3.05%) since the US regional banking stress last March, and the worst week for the Nasdaq 100 (-5.36%) and the Magnificent Seven (-7.73%) since November 2022. A -3.47% decline on Friday marked a sixth day of consecutive losses for the Mag-7.

With three consecutive weeks of losses, the longest such streak since last September, the S&P 500 is now -5.5% from its recent peak. The VIX volatility index rose +1.4 points (and +0.7 points on Friday) to 18.71, to its highest weekly close since last October.

Nvidia (which doesn't report for another month) fell exactly -10% on Friday (-13.59% on the week), contributing around half of the -0.88% loss in the S&P 500 on Friday, and is now down -25% from its highs on 25 March. One catalyst appeared to be their hardware partner Super Micro Computer announcing its earnings date (April 30th) but without preliminary guidance as they have previously tended to do. They fell -23.1%. Everything else related to chips and AI also got stung with Advanced Micro Devices dropping -5.4%, and Arm Holdings -16.9% to 87.19 as examples. By contrast, the Dow Jones index was largely resilient last week, up +0.56% on Friday and flat (+0.01%) over the week. The Europe STOXX 600 also suffered in the risk-off environment but outperformed the tech heavy US market, falling -1.18% (and -0.08% on Friday).

Bonds did not benefit much from the risk-off tone, as markets became more sceptical about US rate cuts. Investors dialled back the number of rate cuts expected by year-end by +7.6bps to 39bps (+0.2bps on Friday). Off the back of this, 2yr Treasury yields jumped +8.8bps last week (unchanged on Friday). The story was similar for 10yr Treasury yields, which rose +9.9bps on the week to 4.62%, though they fell -1.2bps on Friday as markets sought haven assets. In Asia this morning they are back up +3.9bps to 4.66%. In Europe, 10yr bund yields were up +14.1bps on the week (+0.3bps on Friday), reaching the 2.50% level for the first time since November.

In commodities, oil prices initially surged following the news of a retaliatory Israeli missile strike against Iran on Friday, before unwinding most of the gains as details emerged suggesting no further imminent escalation. Brent crude fell -3.49% last week to $87.29/bbl (+0.21% on Friday), and WTI slipped -2.94% to $83.14/bbl (and +0.50% on Friday), also weighed down by stronger US crude inventories data earlier in the week. This morning in Asia, Brent futures are lower again, trading -0.62% as I type.

On the other hand, gold continued its ascent to another record high, rising +2.03% to $2392/oz (and +0.16% on Friday). It's losing a bit of safe haven demand this morning though (-0.9%). Ahead of its major halving event on Saturday, Bitcoin rose +0.72% to $64,034 on Friday after a volatile week. It is up at $64,800 this morning. For more detail on the halving, see here.

In Asia the Hang Seng (+1.67%) is outperforming following a regulatory boost as China’s market regulator pledged support to bolster Hong Kong’s status as a financial hub. Elsewhere, the S&P/ASX 200 (+0.87%), the KOSPI (+0.77%) and the Nikkei (+0.72%) are also edging higher. Meanwhile, Chinese stocks are bucking the trend (down around a quarter to a half percent), after the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) kept the loan prime rates steady. Outside of Asia, S&P 500 (+0.26%) and NASDAQ 100 (+0.36%) futures are trading higher.

Overnight, French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau stated in an interview that Middle East tension are unlikely to drive up energy prices and should not derail the ECB plans to start cutting interest rates in June.

Coming back to this week, the other main highlights by day are the global flash PMIs and US new home sales tomorrow, US durable goods and the German IFO (Wednesday), and US GDP and pending home sales (Thursday). Alongside the core US PCE print, Friday also sees the latest BoJ meeting and Tokyo CPI. Our Japan economist previews the BoJ here and expects no change in their monetary policy stance. However, he forecasts that the BoJ will remove its JGB purchasing guidelines from its statement or revise them to make its purchasing operations more flexible. He also sees the central bank raising its inflation forecast for FY24 amid the strong wage growth data already available as of the March meeting. Elsewhere, the Fed is now on its pre-FOMC media blackout but the ECB speakers will be in full force as you'll see in the week ahead calendar at the end, alongside all the main earnings and macro highlights. 112 Stoxx 600 companies will report this week alongside the 178 for the S&P 500 we mentioned above.

A popular US convenience store chain has been hit with a civil rightslawsuit accusing it of discriminating against minority job seekers because it requires applicants to have no criminal record.

On April 18, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced that it had filed a lawsuit against Sheetz Inc., accusing the 24/7 convenience store chain of having discriminatory hiring practices that targeted minority applicants.

According to the lawsuit, Sheetz has maintaineda longstanding practice of screening all job applicants for records of criminal conviction and then denying them employmentbased on those records.

As a result, the EEOC isaccusing Sheetz of “disproportionately screening out Black, Native American/Alaska Native and multiracial applicants.”

This is despite the fact that thelawsuit does not allege that Sheetz’s hiring practices were motivated by race.

According to the EEOC press release, Sheetz’s hiring practices violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion and national origin. The EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division, after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.

“Federal law mandates that employment practices causing a disparate impact because of race or other protected classifications must be shown by the employer to be necessary to ensure the safe and efficient performance of the particular jobs at issue,”said EEOC Regional Attorney Debra M. Lawrence.

“Even when such necessity is proven, the practice remains unlawful if there is an alternative practice available that is comparably effective in achieving the employer’s goals but causes less discriminatory effect.”

The EEOC began its probe into Sheetz after two job applicants filed civil rights complaints alleging employment discrimination.

The agency then found that Black job applicants were deemed to have failed the company’s criminal history screening and were denied employment at a rate of 14.5%,while multiracial job seekers were turned away 13.5% of the time and Native Americans were denied at a rate of 13%.

By contrast, fewer than 8% of white applicants were refused employment because of a failed criminal background check, the EEOC’s lawsuit states.

Sheetz is a chain of gas stations and convenience stores primarily located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, particularly in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.

The franchise is most well-known for its customizable food options similar to WaWa, with a number of made-to-order dishes, frozen desserts, and milkshakes available.

We give Elon Musk the last word...

You know The Joker is running things when the law-abiding are being prosecuted by the government for not hiring criminals![Insert Sheetz pun]

Winds of change are in the air. Can you feel it? Bitcoin just underwent its 4th halving event last Friday, and buzz has eclipsed the ecosystem as transaction fees simultaneously shot up to record-high levels. The typical reward for a bitcoin block pre-halving is shown on top, around 7 BTC in total between the block subsidy and transaction fees.The total reward for halving block 840,000 was 40.7 BTC, more than $2.6 million at today's market price:

Here's the thing: the fee spike has little to nothing to do with the halving itself. It has to do with a new token protocol that launched on top of Bitcoin at block height 840,000, calledRunes.

It uses Bitcoin's OP_RETURN data, which allows users to attach up to 80 bytes of extra data to a Bitcoin transaction output. Anybody can mint a rune by specifying a name, ID, symbol, quantity, and other data. Users can then sign with their private key and broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network.

Bitcoin's block reward has two pieces:

A massive influx of users minting Runes in block 840,000 and blocks over the subsequent 24 hours drove fees as a % of the total block reward to a record-high level of 74%. The activation of Runes also drove thelongest unbroken periodof blocks with transaction fees higher than their block subsidy.

Mean transaction fees have since come down, from $250 to sub-$40, below their late-2017 averages. They have normalized back to 35% of the total block reward, in line with its historical trend for the last year.

This is the first time that a major fee spike had nothing to do with people cashing out at a market top or bottom. We had a fee spike in late 2017 and early 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, once we passed previous all-time highs in 2024, and the Runes protocol launch. Note the size of the spike in fees as a % of the block subsidy across all of these events, and you'll see just how badly Runes clogged blocks:

Transaction fees collected by bitcoin miners tripled the previous all-time high the day after the halving, on April 20th, coming in at over $78,000,000.

Needless to say, bitcoin will not have a security budget problem once transaction fees overtake newly minted BTC in every block, and eventually after there is no new bitcoin left to be minted after ~2140.

Contributing hundreds of millions of dollars to miners over a two-day period is excellent, the issue is just a function ofwhy. Is miner profitability being improved thanks to the network's chief function, or is it being improved because of spam?

Think about it this way: a local bakery can have its best revenue day ever if the circus comes to town, buys 20,000 croissants, and lights them all on fire. The bakery is more profitable than ever, but it isn't profitable while serving its chief function. People who want to use the bakery for its chief function, making food for people to buy and eat, are now out of luck because the bakery is at capacity.

This truncated event illustrates the need to accelerate the development of layer-2 scaling solutions for bitcoin if it is to effectively make the jump from its store of value monetization phase into its medium of exchange proliferation and use phase.

Miner profitability is doing just fine post-halving. Miner revenue is at $76/PH/day, down from the $182/PH/day spike from Runes, but higher than the average daily profitability during bitcoin's 4th halving epoch:

Here's the last chart I leave you with today. 9 out of the top 10 largest publicly-held bitcoin miners are up since the beginning of last year. Underperformance compared to bitcoin in the months before and after the halving is to be expected. Miners are in constant global competition to allocate capital to the Bitcoin network profitably. Paired with the shareholder duty of a public-traded company, we seriously have nothing to worry about with miners. They will be alright:

2024-04-22 21:40:00,"""Not About Freedom Of Expression"": Aussie Politicians Unite Against Elon Musk's X",https://web.archive.org/web/20240423121142/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/not-about-freedom-expression-aussie-politicians-unite-against-elon-musks-x#comment-stream,"Authored by Monica O'Shea via The Epoch Times,

Elon Musk’s X is facing strong criticism from both the centre-left Labor Party and the centre-right Liberal-National Coalition in Australia amid a legal challenge against the country’s online content tsar.

Mr. MusklabelledAustralia’s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant (a former Twitter employee), the “Australian censorship commissar,”after she issued an order to X to take down videos related to thealleged stabbingof a Christian bishop.

X says it had removed all posts domestically, but the commissioner’s order calls for the removal of content around the world.

X is planning to challenge this in court, and said the posts did not violate its rules on “violent speech” - content that incites or glorifies violence.

However, the Liberal Party’s Shadow Foreign Minister Simon Birmingham called X’s contention a “completely ridiculous and preposterous argument.”

“The type of standards that we expect in everyday life that we expect in other forms of media should be able to be applied to the online world as well,”Mr. Birmingham saidon ABC News Breakfast on April 22.

“The idea that it is censorship to say that imagery of a terrorist attack, of a stabbing incident should not be able to be broadcast in an unfiltered way for all to see—children to access and otherwise—is an insulting and offensive argument.”

The senator also argued Mr. Musk’s argument was “irresponsible” given the impact of the social media posts on potential terrorists.

“It is also an irresponsible one when you consider the implications that can have for inspiring potentially future terrorists, for creating discord and disharmony in communities, and driving people further apart when such images are manipulated or used with propaganda or other information,” he said.

The Australian censorship commissar is demanding *global* content bans!https://t.co/CRLglUYYIG

This comes after Labor’s Health Minister Mark Butler said the government would not be “bullied” by Mr. Musk.

“And can I say this: Australia is not going to be bullied by Elon Musk, or any other tech billionaire, in our commitment to making sure that social media is a safe space,” Mr. Butler said during apress conference.

Mr. Butler said if Mr. Musk wanted to fight the fine in court, the government was up for it because they were determined to keep “social media safe.”

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he found it “extraordinary X chose not to comply.”

“We know, I think overwhelmingly, Australians want misinformation and disinformation to stop. This isn’t about freedom of expression,”he told reporters.

“This is about the dangerous implications that can occur when things that are simply not true, that everyone knows is not true, are replicated and weaponised in order to cause division, and in this case, to promote negative statements.”

Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek called Mr. Musk an “egotistical billionaire.”

“It’s more important for him to have his way than to respect the victims of the crimes that are being shown on social media and to protect our Australian community from the harmful impact of showing this terrible stuff on social media,” she said on Sunrise.

“We need to keep Australians safe from this terrible stuff on social media. And Elon Musk doesn’t dictate to the Australian government what we are doing here domestically with our laws.”

I’d like to take a moment to thank the PM for informing the public that this platform is the only truthful onehttps://t.co/EM0lF6n7SC

Meanwhile, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton agreed there was a case for “tougher action” against social media companies during an interview with ABC Insiders on April 22.

“No question at all, and I think there’s a bipartisan position in relation to this. We know that the companies—and we’ve seen some of the comments from Elon Musk overnight—they see themselves above the law,”Mr. Dutton claimed.

“The Australian law here should apply equally in the real world as it does online.”

Mr. Dutton pointed out social media companies turnover billions of dollars of revenue in the Australian economy and indicated the laws should apply to them within the country.

“I think there’s a red herring in a sense here. When Elon Musk says that there’s not extraterritorial reach—that is the Australian law can’t apply to other parts of the world—I’m sure that’s the case. But in terms of the content, which is displayed here, or broadcast here, well the Australian law does apply,” Mr. Dutton said.

Mr. Dutton also indicated the Opposition would support Labor’s misinformation and disinformation laws, despite the Shadow Communications Minister David Coleman beingvery criticalof the law in September.

“Yeah, we are, and happy to have a look at anything the government puts forward, as we’ve said over the last week, with the horrendous scenes that we’ve seen.”

Don’t take my word for it, just ask the Australian PM!pic.twitter.com/ZJBKrstStQ

X received a global takedown order from Australia’s eSafety commissioner to remove posts following theknife attackon a Christian bishop during a livestream service.

However, X says the posts did not violate the platform’s rules on “violent speech,” and revealed it had received a demand from the eSafety commissioner to remove all posts globally—or face a daily fine of $785,000 (US$506,000).

“X believes that eSafety’s order was not within the scope of Australian law and we complied with the directive pending a legal challenge,”theplatform posted.

“While X respects the right of a country to enforce its laws within its jurisdiction,the eSafety commissioner does not have the authority to dictate what content X’s users can see globally. We will robustly challenge this unlawful and dangerous approach in court.”

The recent attacks in Australia are a horrific assault on free society. Our condolences go out to those who have been affected, and we stand with the Australian people in calling for those responsible to be brought to justice.Following these events, the Australian eSafety…

On April 16, the eSafety commissioner confirmed it had issued legal notices to X and Meta to remove material within 24 hours.

The commissioner said notices related to material that depicted “gratuitous or offence violence with a high degree of impact or detail.”

“While the majority of mainstream social media platforms have engaged with us, I am not satisfied enough is being done to protect Australians from this most extreme and gratuitous violent material circulating online,”Ms. Inman Grant said.

“That is why I am exercising my powers under the Online Safety Act to formally compel them to remove it.”

2024-04-22 22:00:00,BlackRock Triples Larry Fink's Home Security As Anti-Woke Backlash Accelerates,https://web.archive.org/web/20240423121142/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/blackrock-triples-larry-finks-home-security-anti-woke-backlash-accelerates,"BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink's efforts to push 'wokesim' or environmental, social, and governance policies across corporate America have been in reverse in recent years amid the backlash from Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill and 19 state attorneys general in conservative states, including Arizona and Texas, who have been fed up with ESG-related policies hurting the economy.

Supposedly, the backlash by anti-woke activists has forced BlackRock to triple Fink's home security spending.Financial Timessays the CEO has become ""a target for anti-woke activists and conspiracy theorists.""

According to FT's numbers, the $10.5 trillion money manager spent $563,513 to ""upgrade the home security systems"" at Fink's residences during 2023, on top of $216,837 for bodyguards.

The ESG movement has been highly politicized. Vivek Ramaswamy, one of the Republican party's presidential candidates before Donald Trump was nominated, called Fink ""the king of the woke industrial complex [and] the ESG movement.""

In December, Fink said his firm was unfairly targeted by candidates in the fourth Republican presidential debate, calling it a ""sad commentary on the state of American politics.""

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has called BlackRock the ""economic power"" to instill a ""left-wing agenda.""

Besides conservative lawmakers revolting against the world's largest woke money manager at the state level and on Capitol Hill, UBS bankers on Wall Street are becoming increasingly frustrated with unrealistic climate goals. Here's the note,""ESG Frustration And Backlash In The Banking Sector Continues.""

It should be no surprise to our readers: we have been pointing out the demise of ESG for more than a year now. Earlier in March,we wrotehow Exxon's CEO had all but declared victory over the ""woke"" ESG lobby.

We noted thatCEOs were ditching ESG lingo on conference calls in February. For some context, peak ESG and related synonyms, such as""climate change"" and ""clean energy"" and green energy"" and net zero,""among other terms, peaked at 28,000 mentions in the first quarter of 2022. Ever since, the number of mentions has plunged.

Fink's beefing up security is a sign that the political ideology pushed by the asset manager does not align with actual investors and most Americans.

U.S. President Joe Biden is announcing on Monday$7 billion in grants to help more than 900,000 low-income households install residential solar power,the White Housesaid.

President Biden will mark today’s Earth Day by traveling to Prince William Forest Park in Triangle, Virginia, and is expected tohighlight the Administration’s progress “in tackling the climate crisis, cutting costs for everyday Americans, and creating good-paying jobs,”the White House said.

The $7 billion in grants will come from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Solar for All grant competition, a key component of the Inflation Reduction Act’s $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

The selectees under the competition are expected to deliver residential power to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities,saving households more than $350 million in electricity costs annually, or about $400 per household,according to the White House.

The rooftop solar program will also help avoid more than 30 million metric tons of carbon pollution over the next 25 years.

EPA has received 150 applications, and 60 applicants were selected through a robust multistage review,Environmental Protection Agency Deputy Administrator Janet McCabesaidin a call with reporters.

U.S. solar installations surged in 2023, as solar accounted for over 50% of new electricity capacity added to the grid, for the first time in history, the annual solar market review of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzieshowedearlier this year.

...the biggest residential solar market in the U.S., California, has seen major policy changes in the way the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) will compensate rooftop solar customers for the excess energy they generate.

This decision moved the state from retail rate “net metering” to a new “net billing” structure that cuts the value of rooftop solar credits by about 75%.

This, according to SEIA and WoodMac, is expected to crash California’s residential solar market in 2024, contributing to a projected 36% decline across all segments in the state.

2024-04-22 23:00:00,Supreme Court Denies Bid To Expand No-Excuse Mail-In Ballots In Texas,https://web.archive.org/web/20240423121142/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/supreme-court-denies-bid-expand-no-excuse-mail-ballots-texas#comment-stream,"Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear a legal challenge to a Texas law that requires voters under the age of 65 to provide justification to vote by mail, meaning that the Democrat-aligned attempt to sharply expand “no-excuse” mail-in ballots in the Lone Star state has failed, with implications for other states.

According to an April 22order list,the high court denied petition for a writ of cetriorariin a casethat stems from a federal lawsuit filed in 2020 on behalf of the Texas Democratic Partyand several voters who requested that Texas lift its age-based limitations on no-excuse mail-in voting.

Texas lawonly allowsindividuals to vote by mail without a qualifying excuse, like sickness, if they are 65 years or older. In theiroriginal complaint, which made its way through a number of lower courts before ending up before the Supreme Court, the petitioners alleged that the Texas voting law violates the 26th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits denying the right to vote due to age.

The Supreme Court’s refusal to hear the appeal means that the Texas law stays in place, delivering a win to election integrity advocateswho arguethat no-excuse mail-in voting is prone to fraud and makes elections less secure.

At the same time, the high court’s decision to deny certiorari is a setback for groups who see laws like Texas’s age-based limits on no-excuse mail-in ballots as “voter suppression” or an unfair attempt to impose barriers to voting for certain groups, in this case younger voters.

The high court’s decision not to hear the appeal has broader implications, however, since six other states–Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee–have similar laws on the books that let older voters to request absentee ballot without having to provide any justification.

Public opinion in Texas over the issue of no-excuse mail-in voting is split, according tosome polls.

In their initial petition filed in 2020 on behalf of the Texas Democratic Party and a group of voters amids the COVID-19 pandemic, the plaintiffs requested that Texas lift its age-based restrictions to no-excuse mail-in voting, citing public health risks related to the outbreak.

A district court judge sided with the plaintiffs in May 2020,temporarily blockingthe Texas law.

Led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Texas officials thenfiled an appealwith the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which paused the district court’s ruling while the appeal played out.

The plaintiffs thenaskedthe U.S. Supreme Court to reimpose the district court’s decision to freeze enforcement of the age-based limits to no-excuse mail-in voting, or to take the case up for review, but the high court rejected both requests.

Ultimately, the 5th Circuitvoidedthe lower court’s May 2020 order in full. This led the plaintiffs to file anamended complaintin the district court, this time asserting other claims, including ones of racial discrimination under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and arguing that the age limitations on mail-in ballots violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th and 26th Amendments.

In a July 2022order, the district court judge dismissed all of the plaintiffs’ claims, leading to another appeal before the 5th Circuit, which ultimatelyaffirmedthe district court’s decision to dismiss.

The plaintiffs filed apetitionfor a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court in December 2023, asking the high court to declare Texas’s age-based voting law unconstitutional.

The court declined to review the plaintiffs’ appeal, leaving Texas’s age restrictions in place and denying a bid to expand no-excuse mail-in voting in the Lone Star state.

The Epoch Times has reached out to counsel for both petitioners and respondents with a request for comment on the high court’s decision.

The Supreme Court ruling comes amid a broader fight between those who see election integrity efforts as “voter suppression” and those who believe that the security of U.S. elections is too lax and should be tightened.

According to a running tally by the left-leaningBrennan Center for Justice, expansive voting laws far outpaced restrictive ones in 2023.

At least 53 expansive voting laws were introduced last year in at least 23 states, compared to 17 restrictive laws being passed in 14 states, suggesting that the election integrity movement is falling behind.

Amid concerns over voter fraud, former House Speaker Newt Gingrichrecently suggestedthat to win the presidential election in November, Republicans need to outvote Democrats by a significant margin.

“Everybody who wants an honest election should know that in the long run, we need the French model: Everybody votes on the same day, everybody has a photo ID, everybody’s accounted as a person,” Mr. Gingrich said in a February interview on Fox News.

“But until we get to that, if Republicans want to win this year, under the rules that exist this year, they need to outvote the Democrats by about 5 percent, which is a margin big enough that it can’t be stolen,” he said.

Elsewhere, an election integrity monitorlaid outover a dozen “critical” reforms that it believes are necessary in order to secure voter integrity in the 2024 election, including outlawing ranked choice voting and non-citizen voting, consolidating election dates, requiring voter ID, and safeguarding vulnerable mail ballots.

At over 16,000 troops, the exercises called the ""Balikatan"" drills (or ""shoulder to shoulder"")mark the largest ever conducted between the two allies. ""The 2024 iteration is not only the largest but the most complex,""Newsweekconfirmed of the annual exercise.

The joint exercises will focus on ""seizing maritime terrain, HIMARS infiltrations, and coastal defense and maritime strike operations among others""—and are taking place around the the Philippine provinces of Palawan and Batanes, geographically near disputed China Sea areas as well as Taiwan.

A US Marine Corps statementdescribedBalikatan as a ""cornerstone event between the US and the Philippines, directly supporting the refinement and understanding of our shared Mutual Defense Treaty obligations.""

To be expected, Beijing has blasted the war games as a provocation, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian warning against the placement and deployment of US weapons systems""at China's doorstep.""He further put the Philippines on notice, saying there will be""serious consequences of pandering to the United States.""

He further said Manilla ""should understand that drawing in countries outside the South China Sea to flex their muscles and stoke confrontation in the region will only intensify tensions and undermine regional stability.""

Russia'sSputnikhas the following details on the scope of thenew drills:

Recently, rival Chinese and Philippine coast guard patrols have directly clashed over maritime territory and fishing rights. Often these involve the firing of water canons well as dangerous ramming situations.

Washington and Manillas are defense treaty partners - meaning that if Philippine forces ever come under direct military attack, the United States is 'obligated' to intervene on their behalf.

2024-04-23 02:00:00,NATO's Never-Ending War: The 75-Year-Old Bully Is Faltering,https://web.archive.org/web/20240423121142/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/natos-never-ending-war-75-year-old-bully-faltering#comment-stream,"Authored by Ramzy Baroud via Counterpunch.org,

The western discourse on the circumstances behind the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), 75 years ago, is hardly convincing.

Yet, that over-simplified discourse must be examined in order for the current decline of the organization to be appreciated beyond the self-serving politics of NATO’s members.

The history recordspageof the US State Department speaks of the invention of NATO in a language suitable for a US high school history book.

“After the destruction of the Second World War, the nations of Europe struggled to rebuild their economies and ensure their security,”it reads, which compelled the US to take action:“(integrating) Europe as vital to the prevention of communist expansion across the continent.”

This is the typical logic of NATO’s early doctrine. It can be gleaned from most of the statements made by Western countries that established and continue to dominate the organization.

The language oscillates between a friendly discourse – for example, Harry Truman’sreferenceto NATO as a ‘neighborly act’ – and a threatening one, also Truman’s tough language against “those who might foster the criminal idea of having recourse to war.”

The reality, however, remains vastly different.

Indeed, the US did emerge much stronger, militarily and economically after WWII. That was reflected in the Marshall Plan, an ‘Economic Recovery Plan’, which was a strategic, not a charitable act.It engineered the economic recovery of selected countries who would become the US’ global allies for decades to come.

Upon its establishment, then Canadian Secretary of State Lester Pearson referred to the NATO ‘community’ as part of the ‘world community’, linking the strength of the former to “preserving the peace” for the latter.

As innocuous as such language may seem, it introduced a paternal relationship between the US-dominated NATO and the rest of the world. Thus, it allowed the powerful members of the organization to define, on behalf of the rest of the world – and often outside the umbrella of the United Nations – such notions as ‘peace’, ‘security’, ‘threat’, and, ultimately, ‘terrorism’.

A case in point is that the first major conflict instigated by NATO did not target external threats to Europe or US territories, but took place thousands of miles away, on the Korean Peninsula.

The west’s political discourse wanted to view the civil war in the Peninsula, prior to NATO’s intervention as anexampleof “communist aggression”. This ‘aggression’ supposedly forced NATO’s hands to react. Needless to say, the Korean War (1950-53) was a destructive one.

The 75 years since then proved the flimsiness of that argument.The Soviet Union has long been dismantled, and North Korea has been desperately fighting to break out of its isolation. Yet, a fractious state of no war-no peace remains in place. It could turn into an outright war at any time.

However, what the war has achieved is something entirely different. The constant state of non-peace provides a justification for the permanent US military presence in the region.

Similar outcomes followed most of NATO’s other interventions:Iraq (1991 and 2003), Yugoslavia (1999), Afghanistan (2001), Libya (2011) and so on.

Yet, the ability to start or exacerbate conflicts, and the inability, or perhaps unwillingness to permanently end wars, is not the real crisis at NATO, 75 years after its establishment.

In an article marking the anniversary, UK Secretary of Defense, Grant Shappswrotein the Daily Telegraph that NATO must accept that it is now in a “pre-war world”.

He lashed out at those NATO members who were “still failing” to meet the minimally required spending on defense, which equals to two percent of total national GDPs.“We cannot afford to play Russian roulette with our future,”he wrote.

Shapps’ anxieties are often expressed by other top NATO leaders and officials, who are either warning of an imminent war with Russia or criticizing each other for the dwindling influence of the once-powerful organization.

Much of that blame was placed on former US President Donald Trump, who outrightthreatenedto leave NATO during his only term in office.

Trump’sdisparagingcomments and threats, however, were hardly the instigator of the crisis.

They were symptoms of growing problems, which have continued for years after Trump’s dramatic exit from the White House.

NATO’s crisis can be summarized as this:

First, the geopolitical formations that existed following the collapse of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact no longer exist.

Second, the main aspect of the new global competition cannot be reduced to military terms. Rather, it is economic.

Third, Europe is now largely dependent on energy sources, trade and even technological integration with countries that the US perceives as enemies: China, Russia and others. Therefore, if Europe allows itself to subscribe to the US polarized language on what constitutes enemies and allies it will pay a heavy price, especially as EU economies are already struggling under the weight of continued wars and constant disruption of energy supplies.

Fourth, fixing all of these challenges and more through the dropping of bombs is no longer an option. The ‘enemy’ is far too strong, and the changing nature of warfare makes traditional war largely ineffectual.

Though the world has greatly changed, NATO remains committed to a political doctrine from a bygone era. And even if the two percent threshold is met, the problem will not go away.

It is time for NATO to re-examine its 75-year-old legacy, and be courageous enough to change directions altogether – instead of opting for a state of non-peace, actually seeking real peace.

2024-04-23 02:45:00,EU Leaders Trying To Convince Greece & Spain To 'Sacrifice' Their Own Anti-Air Defenses For Ukraine,https://web.archive.org/web/20240423121142/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/eu-nato-trying-convince-greece-spain-sacrifice-their-own-anti-air-defenses-ukraine,"NATO and European Union leaders are literally pressuring member states to sacrifice their own national defense for the sake of Ukraine, part of the ongoing saga of desperation which has led some Western nations todeplete domestic arms and ammostockpiles.

A disturbing report byFinancial Timespublished Monday saysGreece and Spain are under intensifying pressure from Western allies to give up what few Patriot anti-air defense systems that they possess.

Russia has continued to decimate Ukraine's energy, logistics, and communications infrastructure via superior airpower - and Kiev has had few options, limiting its response. President Putin has said the stepped-up air attacks are in direct retaliation to Ukraine's own cross-border drone attacks on Russian oil facilities. Drones have also frequently been sent over Crimea.

President Volodymyr Zelensky issued an urgent appeal Sunday on X, writing that ""Patriots can only be called air defense systems if they work and save livesrather than standing immobile somewhere in storage bases.""

Commenting on Ukraine's ongoing pleading, one Western official was cited inFT as saying,""We all know who has them, we all know where they are, and we all know who really needs them.""

Only Germany has so far answered the call by lately providing a single Patriot battery. FT reported on back-to-back meetings of EU foreign and defense ministers of the last days, where it's been decided that Greece and Spain's anti-air systems aren't really crucial to theirhomeland defense:

Other EU leaders used a summit in Brussels last week to personally urge Spanish and Greek prime ministers Pedro Sánchez and Kyriakos Mitsotakis to donate some of their systems to Ukraine, according to people briefed on the discussions.

The two leaders, whose armed forcespossess between them more than a dozen Patriot systems plus others such as S-300s, were told their need was not as great as Ukraine’s and thatthey did not face any imminent threat.

An EU diplomat said, ""There are countries that are not in immediate need of their air defense systems, to be very honest."" This as ""Each country is being asked todecide what it can spare,"" according to the statement. Countries like Poland or those in the Baltics and Eastern Europe are considered too vulnerable at this moment to be asked to give up their defenses.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell is also ramping up the pressure, saying ""I don’t have Patriots in Brussels, they are in the capitals, and it is up to them to take decisions.""

So this is what it has come to:firstEuropean populations are dubiously told that Putin is eyeing expansion of the war deeper into Europe, andnextWestern countries aretold to make drastic decisions which severely weaken their own national security.

Greece in particular has faced long-running threats from Turkey, with the geopolitical rivals locked in a dispute over maritime territory which has at timesvery nearly resulted in a shooting war. This has happened on several occasions in the last couple of years. So certainly the Greek population is going to balk when EU leaders in faraway capitals lecture Greece about 'not really needing' anti-air protection. And if they are sent to Ukraine, there's a chance they could be destroyed anyway.

2024-04-23 03:30:00,Sweden Wants EU To Sanction Russia's Shadow Fleet And Ban Its LNG,https://web.archive.org/web/20240423121142/https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/sweden-wants-eu-sanction-russias-shadow-fleet-and-ban-its-lng,"By Tsvetana Paraskova ofOilPrice.com

The next round of EU sanctions against Russia over the invasion of Ukraine should include measures to address the shadow fleet of tankers helping Russia move its oil and a ban on EU imports of Russian LNG, Sweden’s foreign minister said on Monday.

“Adopting the 14th sanctions package is one of the most important things,”Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said arriving at an EU foreign ministers’ meeting in Luxembourg, as carried byReuters.

“We will see to it that we both include animport ban on liquefied natural gasas well asmeasures to curb the Russian shadow fleet,” the Swedish minister added.

The EU has just started discussions on the 14thpackage of sanctions and it is not expected to adopt the measure anytime soon.

EU member states are divided on a ban on LNG imports. Sweden and the Baltic countries press for a ban, but other member states and the EU energy regulator say Europe is now much more dependent on LNG to afford an immediate ban on imports of LNG from Russia.

The European Union should be careful in its efforts to ditch Russian LNG as it should protect its security of gas supply, the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, ACER, said in areportlast week.

As the EU aims to completely end its reliance on Russian fossil fuels by 2027, “the reduction of Russian LNG imports should be considered in gradual steps starting with spot Russian LNG imports,”ACER said in itsreport.

“While such measures may target to reduce dependence on Russian gas, it’s important to note that substantial volumes have already been contracted under long-term LNG agreements before the Russian invasion of Ukraine,” the EU regulator said.

“Hence, reductions in Russian LNG imports should be approached with caution, particularly in light of the imminent expiration of the ship-or-pay transit contract for gas pipeline supply from Russia to Europe via Ukraine by the end of 2024.”

2024-04-23 04:15:00,"Poland ""Ready"" To Host NATO Nuclear Weapons, President Duda Says",https://web.archive.org/web/20240423121142/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/poland-ready-host-nato-nuclear-weapons-president-duda-says#comment-stream,"Poland has upped the nuclear rhetoric with Russia, on Monday suggesting NATO nuclear warheads could soon be positioned on its territory. It comes amidgeneral NATO euphoriain the wake of the US House finally passing Biden's giant aid package for Ukraine,despite widespread acknowledgementthat Ukrainian forces are being beaten by Russia.

Polish President Andrzej Duda declared in a fresh and hugely provocative statement thatPoland is ""ready"" to host nuclear weaponsshould NATO decide to do so as reinforcement of its eastern flank. The words were issued in an interview published Monday by Polish outletFakt.

""Russia is increasingly militarizing the Königsberg oblast (Kaliningrad). Recently, it has beenrelocating its nuclear weapons to Belarus,” Dudacontinued, apparently wanting to match and mirror Russian moves.

""If our allies decide to deploy nuclear weapons as part of nuclear sharing on our territory as well, in order to strengthen the security of NATO's eastern flank, we are ready for it,"" he added.

Duda additionally said while discussing the topic of NATO's nuclear sharing program in the interview that Warsaw and Washington have been in talks ""for some time.""

""I've already talked about it several times. I must admit that when asked about it,I declared our readiness,"" he emphasized.

But the reality is Brussels and Washington are likely to be deeply hesitant based on the nuclear threats emanating from Moscow of late. Moving NATO warheads to Polish soil would most certainly greatly intensify the already somewhat high nuclear tensions, and at a moment the proxy war in Ukraine shows no sings of abating.

While three NATO members are officially nuclear weapons states - the United States, France and the United Kingdom – others are authorized to host nukes (typically 'tactical' nuclear weapons). They areBelgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey.

Apparently Poland is now throwing its name in the hat for NATO's nuclear-sharing program, which would expand Western nuke placement right up toRussia's backyard...

In the new Polish media interview, President Duda also addressed his positive relationship with Republican frontrunner and former President Donald Trump. He spoke fondly of Turmp, saying the two find agreement on ""a lot of common topics.""

“He is a politician with whom I directly cooperated with the United States for four years when he was the president of the United States,” Duda said. ""I want toemphasize very strongly that we have been friends since then. I really like talking to him, because he is an extremely interesting personality and has a lot of experience, both political and business.""

2024-04-23 04:56:09,Speculative froth departing gold as China tightens trading conditions.,https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-23/ross-norman-speculative-froth-departing-gold-china-tightens-trading-conditions,"Not all buying is equal and that is becoming apparent to gold.

Arguably the physical buying interest from central banks as well as Chinese retail purchases underpinning themarketcould count as some of the highest quality in that neither is likely to return to the market irrespective of the price action.

The same cannot be said of the more recent speculative flows which by their nature are arguably agnostic to the asset itself …it'sa pure exercise in making money. Long or short … gold or soda ash futures … who cares. Like 12 year olds high on e-numbers, the futures market can be a riot of activity, rife with rumour and everyone keen to jump on the latest fad.

If you marked the 'new gold paradigm' to 1stMarch 2024 before the yellow metal went near vertical … and showed little regard for neither financial market indicators nor geopolitics … then arguably the gold floor is comfortably set at around $2060. That said, physical buyers who missed the rally will likely jump in as the market retraces, setting a much higher floor. The charts offer some guidance – with the 100 dma at $2250 and this will likely be the first port of call … will it hold ? … that depends upon the level of long liquidation coming out of China, because that seems to be the driving force just now.

So China has tightened trading conditions as a safeguard in a gold market that it clearly deems to be too hot.

On April 8th, the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) advised gold margin requirements would be tightened from 10% to 12%, and the daily price limit would be adjusted from 9% to 11%. On April 12th, further adjustments were made. Starting from the close of clearing on April 15th, the margin requirement for gold contracts was increased from CNY 45,000 per lot to CNY 51,000 per lot. Similar adjustments were made to silver after it hit “limit up” on April 8th.

More importantly, on April 10th, the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE or Shiffy) similarly announced the reduction of trading limits for gold futures, with a maximum number of contracts for intraday gold trading set at 2,800 lots. On April 16th, the SHFE further adjusted the daily price limit for gold and silver futures to 8%, while increasing the hedging trading margin requirement to 9% and the speculative trading margin requirement to 10%.

These changes provide significant speed bumps on the motorway that is gold trading. It is a passion-killer. It follows that Chinese speculators would look elsewhere.

Gold saw the largest price decline yesterday in 14 months followed by a further significant declines today with large volumes being traded in Shiffy (seebelow) :

There is a sense that the speculative froth is leaving the market and as it declines, gold will re-engage with its core physical buyers who have been left behind. If you want to know where that floor is then the charts will might give you a clue – and if not, Indian bargain-hunting is normally a great bell-wether. In short, this correction is healthy for gold.

Rumours that the Chinese government would be building significant stockpiles of nickel sent prices up by a massive 6.5% on Shiffy, just as gold cratered … a coincidence ? I think not.

Meanwhile domestic Chinese gold ETF buying, normally the preserve of a footnote, has accelerated with 28.5 tonnes of gold buying in the last 4 weeks. So as speculators depart stage left, it appears that 'quality' gold investment is re-entering stage right. So grounds for encouragement.

“We added solar and wind like it was going out of style,” said the CIO of the well-regarded US fund. “We have ample land, wind in the middle of the country.” Federal subsidies make electricity almost free. “But it’s a Catch-22 where we’re adding capacity, but reliability is declining.”In Feb 2021 Texas suffered a catastrophic electrical grid failure. Renewables went offline when they were most needed. Gas turbines froze too. 4mm homes went without power. Hundreds died. “Now policymakers across the spectrum seem to be acknowledging the need for both renewables and hydrocarbons.”

“Back in 2018 there was a utopian vision,”continued the same CIO.

“The economics were there, the physics allowed it, all we needed was political will.”

Net zero could be achieved painlessly, while boosting growth.

“But we’ve learned wind turbines frequently break, and don’t recycle well. They kill lots of large birds. Electric cars take a year to repair when you crash them.”

The residual values are lousy when you sell them.

“So now we’re asking better questions and considering the true costs and benefits. The tradeoffs. We’re growing up.”

“Asking good questions is always better for society,” said the CIO.

“There is pushback on the dogmatic view that the future of the world hangs in the balance, and those taking the most extreme positions on the matter have been undermined by an unwillingness to consider nuclear at any price,”he said.

“European banks will not fund hydrocarbons, it’s almost a religious belief at this point. But we will fund them because they’re a vital part of tomorrow’s energy mix and we can earn double-digit returns doing so.”

“If we want to build BMWs using windmills, it’s going to cost a lot to do it, and historically that’s the kind of thing the government must subsidize,” said the CIO. “It’s a societal good, like building parks in cities.” It is not a purely economic decision from the private sector’s standpoint. “A chip factory is being built in Taylor Texas with $6bln in Federal subsidies. Samsung is investing more than $30bln. That’s a societal good too. Because for security reasons, we may all sleep better at night buying some of our chips from Taylor instead of Taipei. But they may well cost more.”

“Ultimately, these decisions are about whether we’re willing to settle for something less good in exchange for something more reliable,”continued the CIO.

“If we want something as good and more reliable, it’ll cost more money. A way to think about these increased costs is a form of insurance.”

Insuring our children’s futures against the risk of cataclysmic climate change. Insuring our access to advanced chips against military conflict over Taiwan.

“Thinking through long-term risks is always a healthy exercise, and insuring against them sometimes requires government funding.”

“Europe made some naïve choices when they went through this exercise,” he said. “Germany shut all its nuclear power plants.” Which required it to increase its dependency on cheap Russian gas, strengthening Putin’s hand, which he then played in Ukraine. “They were going the opposite way; they were essentially selling insurance instead of buying it.”

This of course, is why it is vital that societies ask good questions and consider the true costs and benefits of big decisions.

“And the consequence is that Europe is deindustrializing. It’s stunning.”

2024-04-23 07:20:00,"Which Major City Will Completely Collapse First – Los Angeles, Chicago, Or New York City?",https://web.archive.org/web/20240423121142/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/which-major-city-will-completely-collapse-first-los-angeles-chicago-or-new-york-city#comment-stream,"Authored by Michael Snyder via The End of The American Dream blog,

In 2024, virtually all major U.S. cities have certain things in common.First of all, if you visit the downtown area of one of our major cities you are likely to see garbage, human excrement and graffiti all over the place.  As you will see below, some of our core urban areas literally look like they belong in a third world country.  Most of our politicians don’t seem too concerned about doing anything to clean up all the filth, and so it shouldn’t be a surprise that rat populations are absolutely exploding all over the country.  In some of our largest cities, the total rat population is numbered in the millions.  Meanwhile, rampant theft, out of control violence, endless migration, predatory gangs and the worst drug crisis in the entire history of our nation have combined to create a “perfect storm” of social decay that is unlike anything that any of us have ever seen before.  Millions of law-abiding citizens and countless businesses have been fleeing America’s largest cities, and property values in our core urban areashave been absolutely crashing.We really are in the early stages of a full-blown societal “collapse”, and things just keep getting worse with each passing day.

In this article, I want to focus on the three largest metropolitan areas in the United States: New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.

John Williams recently took his camera with himas he walked through downtown Los Angeles, and he described what he witnessed as “hell”…

Decades of failed policies have transformed one of the greatest cities in the entire country into one of the worst.

At this point, theft has become so rampant that even the ultra-progressive politicians in California have come to the conclusion that something must be done.

So several bills that would “crack down on shoplifting” have been introducedin the state legislature…

The California Assembly has introduced a comprehensive package of seven bills aimed at addressing the rising concerns over retail theft across the state.

One of the key initiatives is Assembly Bill 2943, jointly authored by Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur (D) and Speaker Robert Rivas (D). The bill targets serial retail thieves by introducing a new crime with penalties of up to three years behind bars for possession of stolen property with intent to resell. It also allows for the aggregation of similar thefts from different victims to charge grand theft, under specific criteria.

Hopefully something will get done, because right now a criminal in the state of California can “literally walk into a retail store every single day of the year and steaI $949 worth of merchandise” and never spenda single minute in jail.

""You can literally walk into a retail store every single day of the year and steaI $949 worth of merchandise""""And you will NEVER do a minute in jail""""Under California law, assauIt on a peace officer with anything other than a fully automatic weapon is not a vioIent crime""…pic.twitter.com/jX0l4OK6pA

Los Angeles has become a paradise for shoplifters, but many would argue that things are even worse in the Big Apple.

As I discusseda few days ago, New York City has“a $4.4 billion shoplifting economy”.

Andapproximately 90,000 packagesare stolen in New York City every single day.

This is just one of the reasons why we have seen a mass exodus.

Countless New Yorkers have already left for greener pastures, and lots moreare thinking of leaving…

About 7 million New Yorkers plan to leave the state, a new survey revealed this month.

In a new Marist poll, 37 percent of New Yorkers—roughly 7 million people—said they plan to move away. The number was slightly more concentrated among Republicans, as 46 percent said they plan to leave the state compared to just 29 percent of Democrats.

Unsurprisingly, many of those that are fleeingare heading to Florida…

For many, Florida remains one of the top places to move, but Southern states in general have been recording the biggest influx in transplants.

According to Realtor.com, Philadelphia, Miami, Atlanta, Tampa and Orlando remain some of the top locations for New Yorkers to start again.

I wouldn’t want to live in the Big Apple either.

The rat problem alone would be enough for me to move.

It just continues to escalate, and politicians are now proposing to use“rat contraceptives”to deal with “the millions of rats lurking in subway stations and empty lots”…

In New York City, the idea to distribute rat contraceptives got fresh attention in city government Thursday following the death of an escaped zoo owl, known as Flaco, who was found dead with rat poison in his system.

City Council Member Shaun Abreu proposed a city ordinance Thursday that would establish a pilot program for controlling the millions of rats lurking in subway stations and empty lots by using birth control instead of lethal chemicals. Abreu, chair of the Committee on Sanitation and Solid Waste Management, said the contraceptives also are more ethical and humane than other methods.

Unfortunately, New York City doesn’t have the worst rat problem in America.

That title actually belongsto the city of Chicago…

Chicago has once again been declared the rattiest city in the U.S. according to Orkin’s annual ranking.

Los Angeles surpassed New York on this year’s list now holding the #2 spot and bringing the Big Apple down to #3, Orkin shared.

Other notable shifts included Houston, which moved 10 spots up to #20, and Charlotte, North Carolina that rose 16 spots to #21.

Somehow, the rat problem in Chicago has gone to an entirely new level in 2024.

In fact, one local resident says that it is now the worst that she has ever seenin her entire lifetime…

A resurgence of rats has gotten out of control in Chicago’s Portage Park neighborhood, multiple residents explained Friday as they called for city leaders to take further action.

Diana Gazda, a resident of the Far Northwest Side community for seven decades, said she has never seen an infestation like it.

“We never had a rat problem like this,” she stated. “I’ve been here 71 years in my house.”

In addition to being world famous for rats, the Windy City is also world famous for violence.

In Chicago, you can be gunned down at any time of the day or night.

Nobody is safe, and that is especially truefor police officers…

A Chicago police officer was shot to death early Sunday in Gage Park on the Southwest Side in what sources are saying was an apparent carjacking.

Officers responded to a ShotSpotter alert about 2:55 a.m. and found Officer Luis Huesca with multiple gunshot wounds in the 3100 block of West 56th Street, a police spokesperson said in a statement.

Huesca, 30, was driving home from work, according to city officials. Huesca, who was still wearing his uniform, was taken to University of Chicago Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

So which of these cities will completely collapse first?

I think that is a very good question.

They are all headed downhill very rapidly, and they are all being run by radical leftists.

Of course the exact same things could be said about dozens of other U.S. cities.

For years, Ihave been warning my readersabout the “cultural transformation” that has been taking place in America.

How we raise our kids really matters.

We have been failing them for decades, and now the consequences can be very clearly seen in the streets of our major cities.

A horrific societal collapse is upon us, and yet this nation continues to refuse to change direction."
2024-04-23 07:45:00,iPhone Sales In China Tumble 19% In Worst Quarter Since 2020,https://web.archive.org/web/20240423121142/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/iphone-sales-china-tumble-19-worst-quarter-2020#comment-stream,"Apple shares are marginally lower in premarket trading in New York following a report that first-quarter iPhone sales in China had been the worst since early Covid. This comes ahead of an earnings report from the world's most valuable company next week and other souring reports from independent research firms tracking the slide in iPhone sales in China.

Counterpointreports that overall, China, the world's largest handset market, recorded growth upwards of 1.5% year-over-year in the first quarter, marking the second consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year growth. Huawei is a rising star and the best performer of all major brands, growing 69.7% year-over-year, mainly because of the release of its 5G-capable Mate 60 series last fall. Meanwhile, Apple iPhone sales tumbled 19% in the quarter.

Here are the highlights of the report:

""Momentum seems to be building on a recovery as China's smartphone sales continued their growth trajectory and grew 4.6% QoQ in Q1 2024. The sales promotions during the Chinese New Year festivities were the biggest growth driver. The average weekly sales during the four weeks leading up to the Chinese New Year saw a robust growth of 20% when compared to a normal week, according to Counterpoint's China Smartphone Weekly Model Sales Tracker,"" Counterpoint's Associate Director Ethan Qi wrote in a statement.

Counterpoint's Senior Research Analyst Ivan Lam said on the iPhone recovery story, ""We are seeing slow but steady improvement from week to week, so momentum could be shifting. For the second quarter, the possibility of new color options combined with aggressive sales initiatives could bring the brand back into positive territory; and of course, we are waiting to see what its AI features will offer come WWDC in June. That has the potential to move the needle significantly longer term.""

Counterpoint's data was published one week after International Data Corporation reported that iPhone shipments plunged by 10% in the quarter.

Since early January, institutional desks,Barclays,Piper Sandler,and Jefferieshave warned about a downturn in iPhone sales, mainly because of a slowdown in the world's largest handset market.

While Goldman removed Apple from its ""Conviction List"" and Evercore ISI dropped Apple from its ""Tactical Outperform"" list earlier this year, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan named Apple the top pick for 2024, citing a ""rich catalyst path with defensive cash flows.""

Apple shares have been widely underperforming the S&P500 index on numerous reports this year on weaker iPhone demand in China.

Just 56% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have buy ratings on Apple, while the percentage of bulls for Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms is around 85%.

Besides waning iPhone sales in China, investors have been given the impression that the company lags in the artificial intelligence race. Just weeks ago, there were reports that the company nuked its car project. Plus, the $4,000 Apple Vision Pro goggles do not appear to be taking off as expected.

2024-04-23 10:55:00,"""What Kind Of American Are You?""",https://web.archive.org/web/20240423121142/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/what-kind-american-are-you,"Authored by Jim Quinn via The Burning Platform blog,

We have only seen a handful of movies in a theater over the last decade. Ever since the kids grew up, there hasn’t been a reason to spend too much for too little. Regal Cinemas in Oaks was the place to go in the old days. It had 24 theaters and was always packed. You could never get a parking spot close to the venue. The restaurant near the theater always had a line and you usually had to wait 30 minutes to get a seat.

We decided to go and see Civil War on Friday night, and boy times have changed. Regal Cinemas went bankrupt a few years ago after Covid, and the theater was taken over by some local businessmen. They now play four or five movies, but $10 per ticket is pretty reasonable compared to the chains. Instead of hundreds of cars in the parking lot, there were about 30 cars. We expected a long wait time at the PJ Whelihans, but there were dozens of seats at the bar and booths.

When we ventured over to the cinema, there was no one checking that we had tickets, and it was like a ghost town. A Friday night at the movies a decade ago was a big deal. The place would have been bustling. I can’t see this place making it over the long haul.

There were eight people there to see Civil War.The previews were so loud, we thought we were going to need ear plugs. The sound became more reasonable once the movie started.

I had read a few reviews of Civil War and they leaned negative, for a myriad of reasons. Some people seemed disappointed and angry that the director did not pick a side, or even make a single political statement.

My interest in this movie stemmed from the snippet shown in previews, where a guy holding some journalists at gunpoint asks them who they are, they respond “Americans”, and he asks them:

I think that is a profound question, as this country has already split into at least two enemy camps, with the leftists already fighting the war using any means necessary.

Laws and morality no longer matter during this time of coming conflict. Knowing we are in the back end of this Fourth Turning, there is a high likelihood of civil and/or global war in the next few years. Whenever I point this out, many scorn the possibility of civil war. Some think keyboard warriors will never actually have the guts to get into a shooting war with the government and/ or leftist fanatics.

I was hoping the movie would provide some thought provoking fodder giving me an inkling of what might be on the near term horizon.The movie is more about the journalist characters traveling from NYC to Washington DC in order to get an interview with the embattled president.There was no background regarding what started the civil war, who were the good guys, and whether the entire country was involved. The entire movie took place in the eastern U.S.

My observations are as follows:

The conflict was between the Western Forces versus the existing U.S. government forces.The Western Forces constituted Texas and California, with Florida leaning in their direction. It was not clear whether all the states chose a side. Since both sides had high tech military weapons, the assumption is the U.S. military split its allegiance. That means rogue generals did what southern generals did in 1860.

For most of the movie, you can’t tell who is fighting who. That seems realistic in a civil war scenario.The scene where the journalists are asked “What kind of American are you?” captures how confusing and chaotic it would be. I don’t think the guy dressed in military garb is on either side. They were dumping bodies into a hole. Without anyone to enforce laws, warlords will rise up and execute retribution on locals they consider enemies. Every local community will become a battleground. Neighbors versus neighbors, families versus families.With 300 million guns, there will be blood.

Two characters let it be known that their parents have stayed on their farms in Missouri and Colorado, pretending their is no civil war. They seemed dismayed that they wouldn’t choose sides.That made me wonder whether those who choose to not participate in the coming civil war will be able to work their farms in peace.Since modern society will come to a grinding halt, with shortages of fuel and food, I’m afraid small farmers will come under attack by the hungry masses. It will be essential for small communities of like minded folk to form militias to protect their farms and communities.

We all know our existing uni-party government is corrupt, evil and hates us. Whether we call it the Deep State, corrupt oligarchy, or corporate fascist totalitarians, it is clear they are our enemy. They are continuing to implement their Great Reset/Great Taking scheme, and will only be stopped through violent means.This movie did not take sides, but did imply the existing government will be defeated. The question is who or what takes their place.Sadly, it is unlikely that a republic will be reborn from the ashes of this empire of debt, delusion and decay.

Civil War was a sobering and depressing movie. I think it is a foreshadowing of what lies ahead.

Innocent people will die. Senseless slaughter will be the norm. The boundaries between good and evil will blur. Right and wrong will become meaningless.It will be unclear who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. Conflict is upon us.Will the cessation of our Constitution before the upcoming election be the spark that starts this civil war? Where and when will our Fort Sumter moment happen? I don’t know, but I fear it is close upon us.

“The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is it’s natural manure.”–Thomas Jefferson in a letter to John Adams

2024-04-23 13:25:00,"""F**king Clown Show"": Unsealed Court Docs Reveal Biden DOJ Colluded With National Archives To Target Trump, Jack Smith Tried To Conceal",https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/fking-clown-show-unsealed-court-docs-reveal-biden-doj-colluded-national-archives-target#comment-stream,"Newlyunsealed documentsin Donald Trump's classified documents case reveal thatthe Biden White House colluded with the National Archives (NARA) and the FBI to concoct a case against the former president.

Journalist Julie Kelly has been all over this:

NEW: Thanks to order by Judge Cannon, key evidence related to classified docs case is now unredacted.On the left: What DOJ/Jack Smith wanted to conceal.On the right: Now we know why. More proof of collaboration btw Biden White House and NARA to concoct a case.pic.twitter.com/YVHVmAfOai

What's more,Special Counsel Jack Smith sought to conceal this- telling Judge Eileen Cannon in February that Trump's counsel isn't entitled to discovery on documents between the White House and NARA, that the court should toss requests for evidence of the alleged coordination, and that the court should deny Trump's request for evidence related to secure facilities at his residences. Further,Trump's request for unredacted discovery of materials should be denied.

To clear up any confusion as to what Special Counsel Jack Smith sought to conceal in classified documents case, this is what Smith told Judge Cannon in Feb 2024 in response to Trump's motion to compel discovery from numerous govt agencies:1) Defendants are not entitled to…

As theEpoch Timesnotes further,thetroveof unsealed filings also revealed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) code name for its investigation into President Trump’s presidential records was “[Redacted] Plasmic Echo.”

A key exhibit included with a motion to compel filed in January was an FBI case file labeled “[Redacted] PLASMIC ECHO; Mishandling of Classified or National Defense Information.”

The defense has argued that the emails unsealed on Monday indicate communication between NARA officials, the Biden administration, and the DOJ regarding President Trump’s records, alleging coordination in targeting the former president since 2021.

One email from NARA’s general counsel to the national archivistdiscussed drafting a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland concerning “missing Trump records.” Subsequent emails revealed coordination between NARA and the Biden White House counsel’s office regarding the handling of these records.

The same month (Feb 2022) that Biden’s White House and DOJ were in cahoots with NARA to concoct a reckless document-handling case against Trump, Maggie Haberman helped the cause by claiming Trump used to flush files down the toilet:https://t.co/6ahzAv3p0F

The Sept. 1, 2021, email revealed that NARA’s general counsel, Gary Stern, had been in touch with both the DOJ and the Biden White House “about this issue.” A subsequent email on Sept. 30, 2021, reveals that the White House counsel’s office “is now ready to set up a call to discuss the Trump boxes.”

This email came after Mr. Stern emailed Deputy White House Counsel Jonathan Su two days earlier to “check back in to see when and how you want to proceed re [sic] meeting with [redacted], [redacted], [redacted], and NARA to discuss the Trump boxes?”

Furthermore, the defense highlighted instances where NARA officials didn’t disclose certain actions to Trump representatives, suggesting bias in the investigation process.

The defense alleged that Mr. Su didn’t disclose to a Trump representative that NARA had already drafted a DOJ referral letter when contacting them to discuss access to notes “from the Trump administration relating to records handling.”

MORE NEW INFO from unredacted evidence in classified documents case.Within 24 hours of receiving 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago, here is assessment by NARA.F*cking clown show--pic.twitter.com/yc6RKR7TXg

Despite extensive cooperation btw DOJ and NARA, the govt in May 2023 subpoenaed NARA for other documents. (Trying to figure this one out)19 of the responsive docs--meaning complied with specific request in subpoena--related to Crossfire Hurricane and John Durham investigation:pic.twitter.com/GUE1pxS1TF

The unsealed emails show that NARA took into consideration the Democrat-led January 6 Committee’s investigation when considering the timing of reporting to Congress on their issues of getting access to President Trump’s posts on Twitter (now X).

On Oct. 5, 2023, Mr. Stern wrote in an internal NARA email that the release of a letter to Congress “can be timed with our public release of the Trump social media records ... as well as our release to the 1/6 Committee of responsive tweets on the day of January 6.”

Mr. Stern noted that NARA had “issues” getting President Trump’s “social media records” because the Trump White House didn’t “capture them through the use of third-party archiving tools.”

“I do not think that these problems are something that the AG/DOJ can deal with, but it could be appropriate to report them to Congress, especially since the January 6 Committee has specifically requested Trump’s Tweets from the day of January 6,” Mr. Stern wrote in the email.

Mr. Stern adds thatthe Biden White House counsel “is now also aware of this issue, and has asked that I keep them in the loop to the extent that we make any reference to the White House Office of Records Management.”

Another email shows Mr. Ferriero saying that he had run “out of patience” amid back-and-forth communications with Trump representatives regarding “missing boxes” that, according to a draft email to the attorney general, were reported as having been “possibly destroyed.”

The defense, along with a coalition of news media, asked the court to unseal these exhibits, arguing that the court filings are “matters of public record.”

The defense has accused the prosecution of withholding potentially exculpatory evidence and alleged bias in the investigation.

The filings made public on Monday revealed previously sealed information while limiting the redactions to keeping secret the names of government witnesses.

They were included as exhibits in a motion to compel the prosecution to produce discovery material. In the Jan. 16 motion, they argued that the office of Special Counsel Jack Smith has engaged in discovery violations and has disregarded fundamental fairness in its pursuit of prosecuting President Trump.

The disclosures come amid a protracted battle over court documents, with Judge Aileen Cannon having reminded both parties in various court filings of the “strong presumption of public access” in the criminal proceedings, showing a preference for making public as much as possible. In January, she ordered that no unclassified material be sealed unless there were clear risks to personal safety or national security.

2024-04-23 23:45:00,"Senates Passes $95 Billion Aid Bill For Ukraine, Israel And Taiwan, Forces Sale Of TikTok",https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/senates-passes-95-billion-aid-bill-ukraine-israel-and-taiwan-forces-sale-tiktok#comment-stream,"The republicans do what they always do best: fold like cheap lawn chairs.

Moments ago, in a 79-18 vote, the Democrat-controlled Senate passed a long-delayed $95.3 billion foreign-aid package sending $60.8 billion in ammunition and military equipment to Ukrainian soldiers, as well as billions of soon-to-be-embezzled dollars to the offshore real estate agents of Ukraine's corrupt oligarchs while also fortifying Israel’s missile defense systems with $26.4 billion, and leaving $8 billion for Taiwan as if that will do anything to stop a Chinese invasion. Oh, and speaking of Chinese invasions, the Senate also just forced the sale of the China-owned TikTok in the U.S.

There will be, of course, no change to the invasion at the southern US border because here too Republicans keep folding like cheap lawn chairs to the Democrat ploy to flood the US with illegal aliens who will get free shit for life if only they keep voting for the blue team.

The bill had broad support in the Senate, with backing from almost all Democrats and a majority of Republicans. Several Republicans who had opposed an earlier iteration of the package, which came after a failed push to attach it to a border-policy overhaul, switched their vote to support Tuesday’s bill. The breakdown of the votes is as follows:

The vote brought to a close months of pointless sound and fury, and endless debate over Ukraine, that allegedly split the Republican Party,  with rank-and-file members openly rebelling against their leaders, who succeeded in outdemocrating the democrats.

Biden, McConnell, Schumer, Johnson, and major media players are taking a victory lap over pushing through an additional $61 billion in funding from struggling taxpayers as year 3 of the Ukraine proxy war begins. They want to own this and absolutely should be forced to own this.

The theatrical ""fight"" also called into question both how far the US would go to defend Ukraine, now in the third year of trying to repel Russia’s invasion, as well as America’s leadership role in the world, once the latest rescue funding is exhausted in a few months, which it will be, with the Ukraine having made zero progress in its war with Russia.

The measure passed the House on Saturday and now goes to President Biden’s desk. Biden, who has been pushing for a big foreign-aid package since the fall, said he would quickly sign the measure into law Wednesday.

President Biden on Senate’s passage of $95 billion aid package with funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan: “I will sign this bill into law and address the American people as soon as it reaches my desk tomorrow so we can begin sending weapons and equipment to Ukraine this week.”pic.twitter.com/eOAbtzNqWq

As broken down below, the measure contains money for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as well as humanitarian aid for Gaza—largely matching an earlier Senate bill—plus additions made by the House, such as sanctions on Russia and Iran and the TikTok provision. Leaders in the GOP-controlled House also changed roughly $9.5 billion in economic aid to Ukraine into forgivable loans rather than grants, to make it more politically palatable to Republicans, as if Ukraine will ever repay anything.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) credited the White House as well as Republicans who backed Ukraine for advancing the measure, noting that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) put his political future on the line when he moved forward with the package.

“In a resounding bipartisan vote, the relentless work of six long months has paid off,” Schumer said on the senate floor. In a statement, Biden thanked lawmakers of both parties, saying they answered “history’s call at this critical inflection point” by sending a message to allies and foes about American power.

And just like that the deeply embedded deep state operative formerly known as the House speaker has become the media's darling overnight:

All it takes to get the media to change from mocking and reviling you to slobbering you with praise is to do what they want. It only takes $100B and the betrayal of your voters' policy goals, but what are those silly things compared to praise from the media!https://t.co/id0VrzC77D

Of course, while superficially the bill says ""aid to Ukraine"" where the majority of the money is really going is to the US military industrial complex. As theWSJ reports, the proposal has roughly $60 billion for Ukraine,most of which would flow to the U.S. defense industry for additional weapons such as ammunition and rocket launchers.The new aid comes on top of the more than $100 billion spent on theDefense IndustryKyiv since Russia invaded in February 2022.

And while most muppets in the House and Senate are clearly in the pocket of the military-industrial complex and the deep state, a few holdouts remains.

Sen. Eric Schmitt (R., Mo.), who voted against the measure, called the support for Ukraine to defend its borders “an insult to the American people” while the U.S. struggles with an influx of migrants at its own border with Mexico.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) called his opposition to the proposal’s advancement “one of the toughest votes I’ve cast during my years in the Senate,” saying he couldn’t overcome his concern that humanitarian aid would end up in the hands of terrorists, among other worries.

Others were more ""malleable"" in their ideological beliefs.

Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R., Okla.), who switched from voting against the Senate’s aid package in February to supporting the revised version on Tuesday, said that the politics were complicated.   “Our approach this time was to make sure that the politics are set, meaning that President Trump was on board, it’s something that could be passable, it’s something that could be explained,” he said.

Sen. James Lankford (R., Okla.), who also switched his vote, said he didn’t want to “punish Israel and Ukraine” over the lack of border provisions. Lankford had led a failed bipartisan effort to find a compromise on immigration, which was shot down by Republicans earlier this year as not tough enough.

Asked why some Senate Republicans were slow to support aid for Kyiv,3000-year-old Senate mummy Mitch McConnell cited the “demonization of Ukraine” by conservative political commentator Tucker Carlson.“He had an enormous audience, which convinced a lot of rank and file Republicans that maybe this was a mistake,” McConnell said in a press conference. Carlson declined to comment.

Mummified Mitch also laid blame on former President Donald Trump, Democrats and the border crisis for the amount of time it took to get most Republican lawmakers to acquiesce in continuing to fund the Ukrainian war effort.

“I think the former president had sort of mixed views on it,” he said of Trump’s position on Ukraine aid. “We all felt that the border was a complete disaster, myself included,” McConnell continued, noting that the attempt earlier this year to attach border security provisions to Ukraine funding required senators to “deal with Democrats … and then a number of our members thought it wasn’t good enough.”

“And then our nominee for president didn’t seem to want us to do anything at all,” McConnell said. “That took months to work our way through it.”

Last but not least, the bill also starts the clock on TikTok’s Chinese-controlled owner ByteDance to find a new owner for the video app in the U.S. within a year, or risk a shutdown. But the matter is expected to be decided by the federal courts which means that it will quietly die on some bench in the corrupt US legal system. A court dispute would likely require judges to weigh the national security objectives of the ban against the First Amendment rights of TikTok and its users.

2024-04-24 05:45:00,Meet The New ETFs That Are Offering '100% Downside Protection',https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/meet-new-etfs-are-offering-100-downside-protection,"If 100% downside protection is the norm for banks that are too big to fail on Wall Street, why shouldn't it be for everyday investors?

This is the question that a number of ETF innovators are apparently asking, as a wave of new ETFs offering '100% downside protection' are getting ready to hit the market, in the push to find the newest ETF fad.

After all,somethinghas to replace all of the ESG ETFs that have shuttered in the last year.

Calamos Investments has introduced new exchange-traded funds offering partial returns tracking the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Russell 2000, coupled with complete downside protection through derivatives,Bloomberg reportedthis week.

The inaugural ETF, Calamos S&P 500 Structured Alt Protection ETF, aims to mirror the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust's price returns up to a 9.65% cap.

Full protection requires purchasing the ETF on its launch day, May 1, 2024, and maintaining the investment until April 30, 2025. This ETF, and others soon to be launched, will use call and put options to manage market volatility, though their effectiveness in fully safeguarding against losses is not guaranteed.

Matt Kaufman, head of ETFs at Calamos commented: “With risk-free rates north of 5% today, options-based product issuers are able to deliver meaningful upside participation with 100% capital protection.""

He continued: ""For those issuing ‘protective’ products, the cost of hedging by selling an option — or series of options — to offset the premium to buy a protective put becomes cheaper as rates rise.”

Issuers are launching funds that blend equity exposure with downside protection amid fluctuating interest rates,Bloomberg writes.

For example, the Innovator Equity Defined Protection ETF, launched in July, has amassed $230 million by offering complete downside protection over two years. BlackRock, the top ETF issuer globally, is also proposing similar funds.

Unlike earlier ""buffer ETFs"" introduced in 2018 that protect against initial losses up to a point (such as the first 10%), these new funds from Calamos offer less upside potential but greater downside security.

Kaufman concluded: “For people as they age, nearing retirement — they can’t afford the significant drawdowns of the market, but they also can’t afford to not be in the market. So this gives them an opportunity.”

2024-04-24 06:30:00,How Nvidia Uses Gold,https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/how-nvidia-uses-gold,"What is Nvidia?If you’re a committed gamer the question may sound like nonsense. Nvidia, which wasfounded in 1993, is a tech company that makes GPUs and other products. It originally specialized in making products for the video game industry, that assisted in 3D rendering. If you were a committed gamer, you probably owned their products. If you weren’t, you might not have heard of them.

But with sudden advances in artificial intelligence, it has beeneverywhere in the newsbecause its products can also be used for artificial intelligence. Its fourth-quarter revenue from Q4 2022 to 2023literally increased 265%.

A decade ago, its market capitalizationhovered around $10 billion In 2016, it was around $50 billion.. As of April 2024, it was worth over $2 trillion. TheMotley Foolranked itthird most valuable publicly traded company in the world, just behind Apple.It is now over five times more valuable than Walmart. It isone of the best-performing stocks of the last few years.

Sometimes the stock market, particularly tech stocks, are placed in a different mental bucket than traditional investments and stores of value, such as gold and silver.

But often precious metals are more closely connected to tech than some think.

And that is because one of the essential components in many of its products is gold.Nvidia uses various metals to make its products-gold of course, as well as tantalum, tungsten and tin. SchiffGold has long covered how demand for industrial silver use isforecasted to rise, but many high-tech industries depend on the industrial use of gold as well.

GPU microchips are made with gold as well as other metals like minum, silicon, and copper because of their useful conductive properties.Of course, the monetary value of gold provides an incentive to minimize its use, but the chemical properties of gold remain so useful that manufacturers continue to use gold in chips and sometimes in internal computer wiring and switches despite their cost.

As competition for the best GPUs heats up and the price of GPUs is likely going to rise due to advances in artificial intelligence, the cost of the metal in GPUs will become less relevant to the overall cost of gold.

This means that manufacturers can use more gold in their products without dramatically increasing the cost of their GPUs and other products.

Perhaps that’s why some savvy investors are betting on both gold and artificial intelligence companies.

One prominent example is Stanley Druckenmillerwho shifted his allocation away from big tech and towards AI and gold.

More gold may currently be used for investment or jewelry than in high-tech, but it’s intriguing that humanity’s newest and most advanced technology, artificial intelligence, has looped around to depend on our oldest kind of money.

Gold’s resilience depends on its historic, current, and future usage as money. It’s buoyed by its beauty and use in jewelry and decoration. But its value is also driven by its unique chemical features that power the greatest technologies in the world.

The cost of gold encourages companies to seek alternatives to it, but its natural features guarantee that it’s still used as a vital component of computers and GPUs despite its cost.

2024-04-24 06:55:00,FlySafair Boeing 737's Wheel Separates After Takeoff,https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/flysafair-boeing-737s-wheel-separates-after-takeoff,"Another near-mid-air disaster involving a Boeing 737-8EH was narrowly averted. The incident occurred last weekend in South Africa as the narrow-body airliner traveling from Johannesburg to Cape Town lost a wheel and was forced to make an emergency landing.

South African budget carrier FlySafair operated the 737. According to the aviation blogAirLive, one of the plane's main gear wheels separated during takeoff from Johannesburg.

Following the wheel separation, the 737 descended from 22,000 feet and returned to the airport.

The pilots then performed a low pass inspection for air traffic controllers.

The incident comes days afterwhistleblower Sam Salehpour's testimonyon Capitol Hill, in which he accused Boeing of ""putting out defective airplanes.""

The 737's wheel separation adds to a growing list of recent mid-air incidents involving Boeing jets, which include collapsed landing gear, detached door plugs, engine fires, external covers ripping off, and other cases of wheels coming off. This incident underscores the mounting confidence crisis surrounding Boeing jets.

2024-04-24 07:20:00,"""They Think There Are Too Many Of Us On The Planet"" - Alex Newman Warns Of Tyrannical UN Plans For Our Future",https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/they-think-there-are-too-many-us-planet-alex-newman-warns-tyrannical-un-plans-our,"Via Greg Hunter’sUSAWatchdog.com,

Award-winning journalist Alex Newman, author of the popular book“Deep State”and the new best-selling book called“Indoctrinating Our Children to Death,”says theUN’s quest for total tyrannical control of your life is coming sooner than you could imagine.

Newman explains,“The bigger story here that people are not paying attention to is the UN is coming together in September...and they are having‘The Summit of the Future.’""

""They are telling us they are going to bring out radical drastic reforms in the structure of the UN... and the power of the UN.Think of it as the biggest power grab ever at the global level.The Secretary General of the UN (António Guterres) has put out briefs where he is calling for the UN to be the one world global dictatorship with him at the helm.  In emergencies, the UN would have all power in emergencies and have all power to oversee emergency response...

They say the crisis could be a climate crisis, an economic crisis, environmental crisis, pandemic crisis, black swan crisis or maybe something from outer space.So, basically, anything could be a crisis, and when the Secretary General declares a crisis, all power and authority would go to the UN.  This is like a blank check on the wealth and liberty on every person on the planet, and this is coming soon.  It is imminent.  This is coming in September at the UN, and it is a power grab of historic proportions.

They know their time is short, and they are going for the big enchilada here.  This is really a summit for a tyrannical future...

They want control of every aspect of your life.”

If you think the “depopulation” or murder program by the Deep State is some sort of conspiracy theory or myth, think again.Newman says:

“One of the interesting things about going to the UN conferences is they are totally open and totally transparent about the fact that they think there are way too many of us on this planet.

We are taking up their space and consuming their resources.  They say this openly.

They say there are way too many people having way too many babies, and we have to drastically cut back on the number of people on the planet.  They have a whole agency dedicated to this called the UN Population Fund.”

One sure fire way to kill a lot of people in a short amount of time is war.Newman says:

“They have understood, the globalists, the Deep State, the evil doers and the sick cabal, have understood for a very long time thatwar was the best mechanism for bringing about their totalitarian one world government.

This is not speculation on my part.  This is what they say.Their game plan is war, famine, energy crisis and economic crisis.These are all tools and catalysts for accelerating this agenda.

If millions of people die in a third world war, and it does not matter if it is Iran and Israel, or China and Tiawan, or Ukraine and Russia, it really does not matter,they want millions and millions of people dead so people will give up their attachment to the nation state, self-government and individual liberty and give up anything, money or freedom, anything to make it stop.”

Don’t lose hope because Newman also talks about all the things you can do to not comply with tyranny.

Newman also points out what state and local governments can do and are doing to resist this UN total control of everything.  Newman says,“We are at war, and everyone needs to put on the full armor of God.”

There is much more in the 40-minute interview.

2024-04-24 07:45:00,New Footage Shows Possible Explosion Before Cargo Plane Crashes In Fairbanks,https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/new-footage-shows-possible-explosion-cargo-plane-crashes-fairbanks#comment-stream,"New footage has emerged on X of what appears to be a possible explosion moments before the Douglas C-54 Skymaster cargo plane crashed into the Tanana River near Fairbanks, Alaska, on Tuesday evening.

AP Newssaid the Douglas C-54, a variant of the DC-4 airliner, crashed about 7 miles from Fairbanks International Airport.

Clint Johnson, chief of the National Transportation Safety Board's Alaska regional office, said the cause of the C-54's crash remained unknown, and an investigation is being launched.

Pilot Michaela Matherne, who was en route from the village of Galena to Fairbanks at the time of the incident, recounted, ""When we were in the air there was speculation that it was a cabin that caught fire.""

X userRawsalertsposted land-based security footage of what appears to show a catastrophic failure that brought down the World War II-era cargo plane.

We don't want to speculate too much about that failure because an NTSB investigation has yet to be completed, but the video above appears to show an explosion, possibly occurring in one of the engines.

Here's what X users are saying:

This is incredible footage to have. Such a remote location, and a camera placed looking at JUST the right location. Wow.

Definitely a left engine failure. Could have been a bird strike, especially at that altitude. Sucks regardless.

Looks like an explosion

What happened to the engine?Wonder how it exploded?pic.twitter.com/jRxOCJQRe1

Next question: What caused the explosion?

2024-04-24 08:13:00,"Futures Rise For Third Day As Tesla, Texas Instruments Surge Boosts Tech Stocks",https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/futures-rise-third-day-tesla-texas-instruments-surge-boosts-tech-stocks,"Equity futures rose for the third day in a row - last week's brutal drubbing a distant memory -  with tech outperforming as Tesla soars premarket after Elon Musk vowed to launch less-expensive vehicles as soon as late this year while Texas Instruments jumped 7% after it forecast revenue above the average analyst estimate.  The tech rally has kept stocks afloat after disappointing earnings in the European banking and luxury sectors. Technology shares stood out in the US, with contracts on the Nasdaq 100 rising 0.6% compared with a 0.3% gain for S&P 500 futures.  Bond yields are 1-3bps higher, helping to boost the USD. Commodities are lower though base metals are positive. The macro data focus is on Durable/Cap Goods with META headlining today’s earnings releases. Keep an eye on macro read throughs from F, HAS, NSC, ODFL, SYF, WHR earnings, among others.

In premarket trading, Tesla soared 12% with analysts saying first-quarter results were not as bad as feared. The electric-vehicle maker is accelerating the launch of less-expensive cars in a bid to revive cooling demand. TXN jumped 7.3% following earnings while META +2.1% (which reports after the close), NVDA +1.8%, with the balance of Mag7 are all higher. Copper mining giant FCX is also +1.5% pre-mkt, and may point to investors looking at the broadening AI trade again.

Overnight, the Senate passed a long-delayed $95 billion emergency aid package for Ukraine and other allies, clearing the way for resumed arms shipments to Kyiv within days. It also voted to ban TikTok’s ownership by Chinese parent Bytedance. Looking ahead, Meta Platforms is due to report after the bell.

After a strong performance by US tech giants on Tuesday, attention will be on Meta as the next of the so-called Magnificent  Seven group of companies to report. International Business Machines Corp. and Boeing Co. are also due to release results.

“There are high hopes for big US tech,” said Alexandre Hezez, chief investment officer at Paris-based asset manager Group  Richelieu. “Inflation and valuation levels don’t seem to be a concern at the moment.”

European stocks edged higher, with the Stoxx Europe 600 rising 0.2% as a surge in the shares of ASM International NV was offset by declines for Lloyds Banking Group Plc.Luxury names dropped as Kering SA tumbled after warning that profit will plunge on slowing sales at Gucci, its biggest brand.Here are the biggest movers Wednesday:

In FX, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1% while the Australian dollar tops the G-10 FX pile, rising 0.3% versus the greenback after inflation topped estimates.  Elsewhere, the yen remained a whisker away from the key 155 level to the dollar, with a former top Japanese foreign exchange official warning the country is on the brink of currency intervention.

In rates, treasuries were cheaper across the curve amid bigger losses in bunds and gilts after German 10-year auction and strong business sentiment gauge. Selloff began during Asia session when Australia’s bond market slumped on hot inflation data, its 3-year yield jumping as much as 19bps. US yields are cheaper by 3bp to 4bp across the curve with10-year around 4.64%.Bunds and gilts lag by additional 1.5bp and 2.5bp in the sector. Australia’s 10-year closed almost 14bp cheaper on the day, its 2-year more than 18bp. Treasury coupon auctions resume at 1pm New York time with $70b 5-year notes, following strong 2-year note sale Tuesday. WI 5-year yield at around 4.655% is ~42bp cheaper than last month’s, which stopped through by 1bp in a solid sale. The week's auction cycle concludes Thursday with $44b 7-year note sale

In commodities, oil prices decline, with WTI falling 0.5% to trade near $83. Spot gold falls 0.3%. Iron ore rises to a seven-week high.

Bitcoin was flat and sits just above USD 66k, whilst Ethereum posted incremental gains and above USD 3.2k.

Looking at today's calendar, US economic data slate includes March durable goods order at 8:30am. There are no speeches from Fed members who entered quiet period ahead of May 1 policy announcement.

APAC stocks gained as the region took impetus from the rally on Wall St where soft PMI data spurred a dovish reaction across asset classes.ASX 200 was led by gold miners after several quarterly production updates but with the advances in the index capped by firmer-than-expected CPI data. Nikkei 225 outperformed its peers and rose above the 38,000 level amid tech strength. Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp. conformed to the broad upbeat sentiment seen across the region amid tech strength in Hong Kong as SenseTime shares surged over 30% following the unveiling of its latest AI model. However, gains in the mainland were capped after the US Senate passed the Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan aid package which includes the threat to ban TikTok in the US.

European bourses, Stoxx 600 (+0.2%) are mostly firmer; price action today has been contained within tight ranges, although bourses remained at session highs throughout the morning.European sectors are mixed; Tech is the clear outperformer, following significant post-earnings strength in ASM International (+10.5%). Basic Resources benefits from broader strength in base metals prices. Banks are found towards the bottom of the pile, after Lloyds (-0.9%) reported softer NII metrics. US Equity Futures (ES +0.2%, NQ +0.6%, RTY -0.2%) are mixed, with clear outperformance in the NQ, whilst the RTY lags. The former benefits from Tech-led gains, after Texas Instruments (+7%) reported strong results. Additionally, Tesla (+10.5%) benefits pre-market, despite missing on top and bottom lines, as traders focus on plans for affordable models.

DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap

A very big happy 50th birthday to DB's logo for tomorrow. It came into being on April 25th 1974. The slanting line within a box is at exactly 53 degrees which ahead of my own 50th in less than 2 months time is about the same angle as my back as I get out of bed every morning.

Markets went up at a similar angle yesterday, meaning that the S&P 500 (+1.20%) has now posted its strongest 2-day performance since February. Several factors helped to drive this, but perhaps the most important was actually the disappointing flash PMIs in the US, which added to hopes that rate cuts would still happen this year. That supported a rally in US Treasuries as well, with the 10yr yield (-0.9bps) falling back for a third consecutive day.

That rally yesterday was led by the M agnificent 7 (+1.96%), and after the close, we then received results from Tesla . These saw a headline miss on revenue ($21.3bn vs $22.3bn expected) and earnings estimates for Q1, with the company noting that “vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower” in 2024 than in 2023. However, investors made a more upbeat take on the company’s strategy going forward, with a focus on “accelerating” the rollout of new cheaper models. This sent Tesla shares as much as +13% higher in after-market trading, so a sizeable degree of relief after the -42% decline the stock has seen so far this year up to the close (+1.80% yesterday). US equity futures are trading +0.36% higher for the S&P 500 and +0.72% for NASDAQ overnight on the back of this. I did a CoTD yesterday here showing that at its peak 2.5 years ago Tesla was worth the same amount as the next 12 largest global auto companies. It's still the largest but was ""only"" around $83bn larger than Toyota in second place at the close yesterday. So it's come back to the pack. It's been a heavily shorted stock of late so the rebound in after hours probably also has something to do with that.

Earnings season will continue apace today, as we’ll hear from Meta after the US close later. Before the Tesla results, the weakness in the US PMIs helped to set the tone, with Treasury yields seeing a sharp intraday decline after they came out. In terms of the details, the composite PMI was down to 50.9 in April (vs. 52.0 expected), which is the lowest in 4 months. And there wasn’t much relief from the subcomponents, as new orders were down to a 7-month low of 48.4, whilst the employment index fell to 48.0, which is its lowest since May 2020 at the height of the pandemic. In sectoral terms, services fell to a 5-month low of 50.9 (vs. 52.0 expected), and manufacturing was at a 4-month low of 49.9 (vs. 52.0 expected).

The release led investors to dial up their expectations for Fed rate cuts this year, and the chance of a cut by the July meeting moved up from 46% to 52% by the close. In turn, that sparked a rally for US Treasuries, with the 2yr yield down by -3.9bps on the day to 4.93%, having been as high as 4.998% at its intraday peak. 2yr yields had troughed shortly after a solid 2yr auction that saw $69bn of notes issued at 4.898%, -0.6bps below the pre-sale yield. Further out the curve, the 10yr yield (-0.9bps) fell back marginally to 4.60%, having been just shy of 4.65% before the US PMIs. With rates moving lower, the broad dollar index (-0.38%) saw its weakest day in nearly three weeks. This morning in Asia, yields on the 10yr USTs (+1.7bps) have edged back higher to 4.617% as we go to print.

The rates rally helped to spur a fresh advance for equities, with the S&P 500 closing up +1.20%. That was its best performance in two months, and it was aided by a strong performance for the Magnificent 7 (+1.96%). In addition, the advance was a broad-based one, and the small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.79%) had its best performance so far this month. Meanwhile in Europe, the STOXX 600 (+1.09%) also saw a sharp rise, and the UK’s FTSE 100 (+0.26%) edged up to a fresh record high.

Whilst European equities were advancing, and US rates rallying, it was a different story for European sovereign bonds, as the flash PMIs showed a further improvement in April. In particular, the Euro Area composite PMI hit an 11-month high of 51.4 (vs. 50.7 expected), and the services PMI was up to 52.9 (vs. 51.8 expected). The only notable weak spot was in manufacturing, where the Euro Area PMI hit a 4-month low of 45.6 (vs. 46.5 expected). And here in the UK, the composite PMI was up to 54.0 (vs. 52.6).

With that in mind, yields on 10yr bunds (+1.7bps), OATs (+1.6bps) and gilts (+3.6bps) all moved higher on the day. The move was particularly pronounced for gilts, as we also heard from BoE Chief Economist Pill, who struck a somewhat hawkish tone on the prospect of rate cuts. He said in a speech that “there are greater risks associated with easing too early should inflation persist rather than easing too late should inflation abate”. Along with the upside surprise in the PMIs, that led investors to dial back the chances of a cut by the June meeting, which came down from 64% the previous day to 48% by the close. However, at the ECB, there was a continued convergence on the idea of a June cut with market pricing for June ""only"" down just a touch from 87% to 85% after the decent composite PMI. Bundesbank President Nagel, once of the more hawkish voices, said that “ If the favourable inflation outlook from March is confirmed in the June forecast and the incoming data supports this forecast, we can consider lowering interest rates.”

Shifting perceptions over risks in the Middle East led to a volatile day for oil prices. Brent crude fell from $87 to $86/bbl early on in the US session, but was up to $88.42 by the close (+1.63%) amid lingering uncertainty over new US sanctions against Iran as well as reports that American Petroleum Institute data showed a decline in US crude inventories last week. Easing geopolitical fears also saw gold fall to below $2300/oz intra-day for the first time in over two weeks, but it was virtually unchanged by the close (+0.02% to $2,330/oz).

In Asia markets are rallying hard this morning with the Nikkei (+2.07%) sharply higher and leading gains across the region with the KOSPI (+1.91%) and the Hang Seng (+1.53%) also climbing. China stocks are lagging with the Shanghai Composite (+0.31%) seeing softer gains.

Early morning data showed that Australia’s consumer price inflation slowed less than expected in the first quarter, advancing +3.6% (v/s +3.5% expected), slowing from the +4.1% annual pace in the previous quarter, thus frustrating hopes for any interest rate cuts for the next several months. The important trimmed mean, rose +1.0% in the first quarter, again above forecasts of a +0.8% gain. The annual pace slowed to 4%, from 4.2% but still too high for comfort for the RBA. Following the data release, the Aussie jumped +0.7% to $0.6530 versus the dollar before settling at $0.6517, while yields on the 2yr (+16.7bps) and 10yr government bonds (+11.5bps) moved higher to trade at 4.06% and 4.38% respectively.

Staying with data but wrapping up the rest of the US action from yesterday, we also had US new home sales for March. They hit an annualised rate of 693k (vs. 668k expected), which is their highest level in 6 months. Separately, the Richmond Fed’s manufacturing index rose to -7 in April (vs. -8 expected).

To the day ahead now, and data releases include the Ifo’s business climate indicator from Germany for April, and in the US there’s the preliminary reading of durable goods orders and core capital goods orders for March. From central banks, we’ll hear from the ECB’s de Cos, Nagel, Villeroy, Cipollone and Schnabel. Finally, today’s earnings releases include Meta, IBM, AT&T, Boeing and Ford.

2024-04-24 08:25:00,"Aussie Senator Says Elon Musk Should ""Be In Jail And The Key Be Thrown Away""",https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/aussie-senator-says-elon-musk-should-be-jail-and-key-be-thrown-away#comment-stream,"Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news,

An Australian Senator has called for X owner Elon Musk to be jailed for life for refusing to adhere to the Australian government’s demands to remove a video of the brutal attack on a Christian Bishop in Sydney last week by an apparent Muslim extremist.

After Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel was attacked at his church in Sydney, the video taken from a live stream quickly went viral on X.

Australian officials, and politicians from both sides of the spectrum immediately called for the footage to be removed, yet Elon Musk has refused to do so, saying that X is a platform for freedom of expression and it will not censor content that is not illegal.

Australia’s so called ‘eSafety Commissioner’ Julie Inman-Grant, an unelected official,has orderedboth X and Meta to remove footage of the stabbing under the Online Safety Act, passed in 2021, which empowers the eSafety department to demand the removal of so-called ‘class 1 material’.

X was ordered by the Australian Federal Court on Monday to block all users from viewing the footage.

The platform temporarily complied with the order in Australia while taking out a two-day injunction, but asserted that a global takedown order violates freedom of speech.

The Australian censorship commissar is demanding *global* content bans!https://t.co/CRLglUYYIG

“We have already censored the content in question for Australia, pending legal appeal, and it is stored only on servers in the USA,”Musk noted in an X post, warning that complying with government demands to ban content is a slippery slope.

Our concern is that if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL countries, which is what the Australian “eSafety Commissar” is demanding, then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire Internet?We have already censored the content in question for…https://t.co/aca9E4uAB7

That is exactly the issue.Should the eSafety Commissar (an unelected official) in Australia have authority over all countries on Earth?https://t.co/wzv4Uinx8y

In comments to Sky News, Independent Australian Senator Jacqui Lambie charged that Musk is “creating hatred” by ignoring requests to remove “harmful content.”

“I think he’s a social media knob with no social conscience, he has absolutely no social conscience,”she said.

“Someone like that should be in jail and the key be thrown away.That bloke should not have a right to be out there on his own ideology platform and creating hatred, showing all this stuff out there to our kids and doing all the rest,” Lambie added.

The Senator for Tasmania also declared she would be boycotting X, proclaiming “I’ll be switching off X today, I’ll be doing that before I get to the airport this afternoon, and I suggest that the other 226, there’s 227 members of Parliament, do the same thing. Show him that you mean business.”

Musk responded to the unhinged rant, noting“This woman has utter contempt for the Australian people,”and later adding “She is an enemy of the people of Australia.”

This woman has utter contempt for the Australian people

Absolutely. She is an enemy of the people of Australia.

Musk has also been targeted by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese who hascharged that Musk “thinks he’s above the Australian law, that he’s above common decency.”

Albanese further asserted that Musk “is so out of touch with what the Australian public want. This has been a distressing time and I find this bloke on the other side of the world, from his billionaires’ establishments trying to lecture Australians on free speech – well I won’t cop it and Australians won’t either.”

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has attacked Elon Musk for refusing to adhere to government demands to censor content. Albanese claimed Musk ""thinks he’s above the Australian law and is ""trying to lecture Australians on free speech."" Report:https://t.co/b1t6FHWajjpic.twitter.com/gidVK5Q9tG

Seems like Albanese is the one out of touch, given that as a result of the attacks on Musk and X, the platform has become the number one news app in Australia.

The Australian people want the truth.𝕏 is the only one standing up for their rights.https://t.co/6ZwzNejKLq

Musk also responded to Albanese:

I’d like to take a moment to thank the PM for informing the public that this platform is the only truthful onehttps://t.co/EM0lF6n7SC

Don’t take my word for it, just ask the Australian PM!pic.twitter.com/ZJBKrstStQ

Meanwhile, Bishop Emmanuel is recovering from the attack and says hehas forgiven his attacker, calling for his supporters not to retaliate over the attack but to behave “Christlike.”

Did anyone ask him for his opinion on whether people should be allowed to see the footage?

As we highlighted last week, the reaction to the video of the attack was almost as revolting as the incident itself.

Preliminary March data showed a slightly better than expected 2.6% MoM rise (2.5% exp) in the headline orders print. However,thanks to the downward revisions, Durable goods orders are now down 2.2% YoY... the biggest YoY drop since the COVID lockdowns...

This is the 8th downward revision of durable goods orders in the last year...

Under the hood, defense and non-defense capital goods orders rose with non-defense aircraft orders surging over 30% MoM...

But... it looks like the AI bubble just burst as Computer & related Products orders plunged 3.9% MoM- the biggest drop since COVID lockdowns...

Finally, and more problematically, core capital goods shipments -a figure that is used to help calculate equipment investment in the government’s gross domestic product report - saw only a small 0.2% MoM rise, which left core shipments down 1.2% YoY- the biggest YoY drop since the COVID lockdowns...

2024-04-24 09:15:00,Primary Protest Vote: 17% Of Republicans Vote Nikki Haley In Biggest Battleground State,https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/primary-protest-vote-17-republicans-vote-nikki-haley-biggest-battleground-state,"On more than one occasion this primary season,the Biden-Harris campaign has been found itself on the wrong side of significant protest votes-- for example, when13.3% of Michigan Democratsvoted ""uncommitted"" to register their deep dissatisfaction with his handling of the Israel-Gaza war among other things.

On Tuesday,it was Trump's turn to face some embarrassment, as nearly 17% of Pennsylvania Republicans voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley--who pulled out of the race weeks ago. With more than 95% of the vote tallied, Trump had the support of83.5%of GOP voters, while Haley got the nod from 16.5%.

“I despise [Trump],” 63-year-old Paul Woessner, a retired defense intelligence officer, told thePittsburgh Post-Gazette.“He’s a criminal. He’s a horrible person, utterly deranged. He’s destroyed one great political party.”

2 takeaways from the Pennsylvania primaries:1) Haley got nearly 17% of the vote despite dropping out 6 weeks ago. She has 155,000 votes with 98% reported — nearly 2X the margin Trump lost the state by in 20202) Democrats had much higher turnout overallGood news for Biden.pic.twitter.com/d4oiembFOL

According to theRealClearPoliticsaverage,Pennsylvania is the tightest among the battleground statesthat will decide the election, with Biden up just 0.5%.With 19 electoral college votes, Pennsylvania is also the most valuable. Haley also put up strong numbers in other battleground states after she'd already pulled out, scoring 13% in Georgia and Wisconsin and almost 18% in Arizona.

The Haley vote was particular strong in the pivotal suburban Philly countiesthat are battlegrounds within the battleground:

To put things in a different perspective,Haley received more than155,000Republican votes on Tuesday.Biden officially won the Keystone State by80,555votes in 2020, and Trump won it by44,292in 2016.

Former Trump communications director Anthony Scaramucci -- who will participate inZeroHedge's Great Bitcoin Debate on May 3rdalong with Erik Vorhees, Peter Schiff and Nouriel Roubini -- took to Twitter to rub the primary outcome in his former boss's face:

Nikki Haley dropped out of the race over a month ago, yet she is polling nicely in PA. Trump has no shot to win the presidency. Write it down and study it. And if you are with him: CRY.

Despite the efforts of the ""Abandon Biden"" movement -- Democrats angered over Biden's policy toward Israel and Gaza -- he fared much better than Trump this time around. Unlike Michigan and other states, ""uncommitted"" wasn't one of the given options in Pennsylvania, so organizers encouraged disgruntled Dems to write in ""No Joe."" It didn't have much of an effect, asBiden ended up with93%of the vote, and Dean Phillips got 6.9%.

Pennsylvania Republicans' warning shot comes aselection-watchers are increasingly focused on the key demographic that's been dubbed the ""Double-Haters.""Representing about 15% of voters, these are people who can't stand either Biden or Trump.

In a March USA Today/Suffolk University poll,44% of Double-Haters said they backed an independent or third-party candidate,such as Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, Jill Stein or Cornel West. Many said they plan to swallow their disgust -- 25% of the Double-Haters chose Trump and 18% picked Biden.

Pennsylvania also has a key Senate race, pitting incumbent Democrat Bob Casey againstDave McCormick, a West Point grad, combat veteran, Bronze Star recipient who became Deputy National Security Advisor and later was CEO of investment management firm Bridgewater Associates.Casey is up 6%.

Both Casey and McCormick were unopposed on Tuesday. Many Keystone State Republicans are relieved to have avoided a fierce primary battle like the one they had in 2022. That contest had McCormick up against Trump-endorsed Mehmet Oz, who managed to lose to this guy:

I love political theater. Pennsylvania debate:Q: “But there is that 2018 interview where you said, ‘I don’t support fracking at all.’”Fetterman: “[Silence] Oh. Uh. I do support fracking. And…I don’t. I don’t…I support fracking. And, I stand…and I do support fracking.”pic.twitter.com/J8BGPr3qqm

2024-04-24 09:24:20,Boeing Jumps After Beating Apocalyptic Estimates Despite Biggest Cash Burn In 4 Years,https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/boeing-jumps-after-beating-apocalyptic-estimates-despite-biggest-cash-burn-4-years,"Having been hammered like a nail for much of 2024 as a result of incident after incident involving its flying paperweights (most recently this morning), Boeing stock enjoyed a modest rebound this morning when the airplane maker reported revenues, EPS and cash flow that were all stronger than expected, while assuring investors that ""demand across its portfolio was incredibly strong.""

Here is what the company reported for Q1:

The latest loss reflected slower 737 Max production, lower 737 deliveries  and compensation to customers after a door panel blew out on a commercial flight.

“Our first-quarter results reflect the immediate actions we’ve taken to slow down 737 production to drive improvements in quality,” said chief executive Dave Calhoun.

But while Boeing is ""driving improvements"", its cash flow is imploding and in Q1 plunged the most in three years. Well, nobody said DEI comes cheap...

And with Boeing incinerating cash at a near record pace, which fell by $8.5BN, even asmaturing debt declined by just $4.4BN,net debt actually rose by $4.1BN!

A closer look at the various divisions, staring withCommercial Airplanes, which saw revenue tumble from $6.7BN to $4.7BN

... andDefense, Space & Security, where thanks to the myriad US wars, revenue rose from $6.5BN to $7.0 BN

As Bloomberg notes, while the defense business posted a slim, $151 million operating profit for the first time in more than a year,the division is still grappling with cost overruns on fixed-price defense contracts,a hangover from its strategy of bidding aggressively to secure military contracts last decade. “Results also reflect $222 million of losses on certain fixed-price development programs,” the earnings release stated, without elaborating.

In any early morning message, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun touted the progress Boeing is making in tackling its quality breakdowns. He touted a 500% increase in employee “Speak Up” submissions compared to 2023. Speak Up is a program that Boeing started in 2019 to encourage employees to internally report potential safety issues. In total,more than 70,000 employees have participated in these ""quality stand downs.""

The company has been hyping the program in recent months, as it faces allegations from whistleblowers who say they were punished in the past for raising concerns. That includes recent claims from a union that represents Boeing employees, which on Tuesday alleged the company retaliated against two engineers who raised concerns about its 777 and 787 jets in 2022.

“Near term, yes, we are in a tough moment. Lower deliveries can be difficult for our customers and for our financials. But safety and quality must and will come above all else,” Calhoun said.

The gloriously incompetent and virtue signaling Boeing chief also acknowledged his plans to step down as CEO “around the end of the year,” adding he would spend his remaining time working to rebuild confidence in Boeing, and to earn that idiotic comp package he received for burning the stock price to the ground.

Turning to M&A, Boeing confirmed last month that it’s in talks to buy back fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems but there was no update on the deal in the earnings materials. In the meantime, Boeing is providing a $425 million cash advance to Spirit to help stabilize its operations while deliveries slow and the supplier works to improve quality control

This latest bailout by Boeing of one of its most important suppliers may signal the acquisition is taking longer to negotiate, RBC analyst Ken Herbert wrote in a note. The deal talks have hit a snag over pricing for factories that make components for Airbus SE jets, Bloomberg reported this week.

Looking forward, Boeing hasn’t provided any hints for its near- and longer-term prospects in the prepared materials published this morning so investors will have to wait for CEO Dave Calhoun’s appearance on CNBC or a later earnings call to learn more. Of particular interest: whether the planemaker still expects to generate $10 billion in annual free cash at some point during 2025 or 2026, as it had targeted before the latest crisis. The company suspended its annual financial guidance back in 2019, when the 737 Max tragedies sparked a global grounding that battered Boeing’s finances. Much of that detail seems uncertain right now with the FAA having a big say over production of the cash-cow jet. Boeing CFO Brian West said in March that the company still expects to generate cash for the year in the low-single-digit billions of dollars.

Still, while the results were terrible they were not as terrible as Wall Street's apocalyptic expectations - and that's even with the US engaged in multiple illicit wars - and BA stock managed to stage a modest short squeeze in premarket trading, which is not saying much: the bounce comes after a sharp selloff in the stock this year that made Boeing one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 Index. Also, whether the surge can stick is a different matter.

The company's Q1investor presentationis here.

Jack Boroudjian is a legendary former floor trader and now Chairman of SmartXData. Aside from over 30 years of industry experience, Jack is a published author ""Secrets of the Trading"", Wiley 2007 and has countless articles published in industry periodicals and websites. Jack appears regularly as a paid, guest contributor for CNBC, both domestic and Asia, and has done over 5000 global guest Television appearances. Jack graduated with honors and distinctions from Loyola University of Chicago and is happily married with two adult children.

Jack and Idiscussedmonetary policy, fiscal policy, the move in gold, politics and why the bond market may take the spending keys away from the Biden administration for more than an hour last weekend.

""People have been conditioned to buy dips, and quite frankly, it was almost forced upon us,"" Jack explains. He points to several factors that shaped this behavior: ""The Fed keeping money very loose, the lack of alternative investment avenues, and no real competition for capital—all of these elements contributed to creating a market condition that was, if you think about it, almost obscene.""

Boroudjian draws on his experiences from the trading floors to illustrate his point: ""It almost feels like what we used to call on the floor of the exchange, the big sucking noise. You'd hear people getting sucked into positions, all chasing the same strategy, and then, suddenly, the market would correct.""

Hereflectson the impact of such corrections: ""I've seen the market correct by 20%, 30% numerous times in my life. But consider this: a 30% correction now equates to 1,500 S&P points. That's more than most people have ever witnessed in their lifetimes.""

""Because there are still way too many people convinced that this little 5% pullback is a blip—it's nothing more than a hiccup. I've had at least half a dozen people tell me it's an election year; there's no way they'll let the market break. But the reality is this: if anybody really wants to know what's going on, I would suggest reading Nassim Taleb's book, 'Black Swan.' It talks about it.”

Jack continues: “Nassim was a trader at First Boston—many don't know his story, but I used to handle him on the floor. He was an options trader in the pit and he went broke. This is one of the most brilliant minds on Wall Street, and he went broke as a floor trader. He got off the floor and ended up making billions of dollars. What took him down was a black swan, something that came out of nowhere that he did not expect, and that's exactly what we could see happening now. Could it be something that we've already seen the beginnings of?""

Talking about gold, Jack said:""So fundamentally, something has shifted in the last few months in the gold market.If you've noticed...(Listen to or read my full interview with Jack at this link).

2024-04-24 09:40:00,Kering Tumbles On Profit Warning As Gucci Revamp Stumbles,https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/kering-tumble-profit-warning-gucci-revamp-stumbles#comment-stream,"Gucci owner Kering SA's problems in mainland China are only mounting as the French luxury giant issued a profit warning. As a result, shares of the company in Paris plunged to a six-year low.

Lackluster Chinese demand for the luxury goods maker, which includes the Gucci, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Yves Saint Laurent, Creed, and Alexander McQueen brands, sparked turmoil in Paris trading on Wednesday. Shares were down as much as 10%, tumbling to lows not seen since October 2017.

Kering said its sales in the first quarter dropped 11%, citing ""tough market conditions"" in its Asia-Pacific unit, particularly in China, one of the world's largest luxury goods markets.

""Kering's performance worsened considerably in the first quarter. While we had anticipated a challenging start to the year, sluggish market conditions, notably in China, and the strategic repositioning of certain of our Houses, starting with Gucci, exacerbated downward pressures on our topline,"" Francois-Henri Pinault, chairman and chief executive officer of Kering, wrote in a statement.

Pinault continued, ""In view of this revenue decline, together with our firm determination to continue investing selectively in the long-term appeal and distinctiveness of our brands, we now expect to deliver sharply lower operating profit in the first half of this year. All of us are working tirelessly to see Kering through the current challenges and rebuild a solid platform for enduring growth.""

Here's a snapshot of the first quarter earnings (courtesy of Bloomberg):

Comparable revenue -10%, estimate -10.2% (Bloomberg Consensus)

Gucci revenue on a comparable basis -18%, estimate -19.4%

Yves Saint Laurent revenue on a comparable basis -6%, estimate -6.75%

Bottega Veneta revenue on a comparable basis +2%, estimate -0.05%

Other Houses revenue on a comparable basis -6%, estimate -4.23%

Eyewear & corporate revenue on a comparable basis +9%, estimate +18.1%

Revenue EU4.50 billion, -11% y/y, estimate EU4.47 billion

Gucci revenue EU2.08 billion, -21% y/y, estimate EU2.05 billion

Yves Saint Laurent revenue EU740 million, -8.2% y/y, estimate EU737.1 million

Bottega Veneta revenue EU388 million, -1.8% y/y, estimate EU381.5 million

Other Houses revenue EU824 million, -7.4% y/y, estimate EU834.4 million

Eyewear & corporate revenue EU536 million, +24% y/y, estimate EU517 million

In the financial outlook, Kering warned that, considering ""deterioration revenue trends,"" the company now expects ""a decline of 40 to 45% in first-half 2024 recurring operating income compared to the first half of 2023.""

In February, Pinault stated, ""Our priority is to get Gucci back on track,"" adding that this ""won't happen overnight.""

Kering has scrambled to turn the sinking ship around, as Gucci accounts for half the group's sales.

Here's what Wall Street analysts are saying about Kering's profit warning amid fears the revamp of Gucci is faltering (list courtesy of Bloomberg):

Deutsche Bank (buy, PT cut to €460 from €540)

Kering has followed up its surprise first-quarter revenue pre- release with a bigger-than-expected flow-through into first-half Ebit guidance, analyst Adam Cochrane says

There are ""limited green shoots"" with regards to Gucci at this stage, and will have to wait until the third or even fourth quarter to see if the Sabato proportion of the collection hit 30-40%

RBC Capital Markets (outperform, PT cut to €430 from €440)

While Gucci's margin cut is ""optically bad,"" it was well- anticipated and largely in the price, analyst Piral Dadhania says

Performance is currently challenged, with no improvement in second-quarter trading, but the market will likely focus on sequential revenue growth improvement driven by new product introductions

Bryan Garnier (neutral, PT cut to €350 from €405)

Jefferies (hold, PT cut to €360 from €370)

Kering's update confirmed Ebit under pressure in the first half, with Gucci's recovery expected to be only gradual over this year, writes analyst James Grzinic

Analyst is encouraged that the group is seeking external partners for real estate holdings, but triangulating Gucci's renaissance remains a ""challenging affair""

Morgan Stanley (equal-weight, PT cut to €365 from €405)

Management's tone was cautious on the call regarding the sales and profit trajectory for the remainder of the year, analyst Edouard Aubin writes

The warning is more a function of incremental operating deleverage rather than proactive investments behind the brands

Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet says that Gucci's design transition and new brand aesthetics might be slower-than- expected in driving brand heat and store traffic

The greatest source of uncertainty this year is the shape of demand in subsequent quarters, and its impact on profitability

2024-04-24 10:00:00,Romney & The Wrong Question: Senator's Statement On Trump's Guilt Captures The Problem With The Manhattan Trial,https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/romney-wrong-question-senators-statement-trumps-guilt-captures-problem-manhattan-trial,"Authored by Jonathan Turley,

Yesterday, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) had a much covered interaction with CNN’s Manu Raju who asked him about Trump’s criminal trial and whether he was guilty of the underlying criminal conduct. Romneyresponded“I think everybody has made their own assessment of President Trump’s character, and so far as I know you don’tpaysomeone $130,000 not to have sex with you.”I havepreviously defendedRomney in his votes on impeachment despite our disagreement on the constitutional standard. I also understand that he was making a more general comment on character.

However, his response is precisely what Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is seeking from the jury: a verdict on Trump as a person rather than the underlying criminal allegations.

Trump is currentlyfacing34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree regarding payments made to Daniels during the 2016 presidential election. As Idiscuss todayin the New York Post, many of us (including liberal legal experts) still question whether there is any crime alleged by Bragg. Raju reasonably asked Romney for his own view.

Romney is an interesting person to ask. He is not only a critic of the President from within his own party but he is a former businessman who has had to deal with complex reporting and business obligations.

Romney’s response must be encouraging for Bragg.

Rather than address the ambiguous criminal allegation, Romney suggested that Trump was guilty as charged in having a tryst with a former porn star.

The defense is not contesting the payment and the fact of the affair is not central to the allegations.

The question is whether the payments were unlawfully denoted as legal expenses with the intent to somehow steal the 2016 election.

Asked Mitt Romney about the hush money allegations against Trump.“I think everybody has made their own assessment of President Trump's character, and so far as I know you don't pay someone $130,000 not to have sex with you.""pic.twitter.com/ofBL15MJw1

It is not a crime to use a NDA or other means to quash an embarrassing story.

Bill Clinton had a host of lawyers quashing allegations of affairs and sexual assaults throughout his presidency. He ran into trouble when he committed perjury in the effort to hide what Hillary Clinton called one of his “bimbo eruptions.”

Moreover, denoting this as a legal expense, on the advice of counsel, is not necessarily wrong.It is not clear how it should have been to be denoted. A “nuisance payment”? The campaign of Hillary Clinton and its general counsel Marc Elias hid the funding of the Steele dossier as a legal expense and was fined by the government for doing so. They litigated the question and insisted that that is precisely what it was.

Romney is precisely what Bragg is looking for in these jurors.Smart and savvy, he still viewed the question of the trial as whether Trump had an affair with Stormy Daniels.  If so, it was not a legal expense. Yet, quashing the story and avoiding any litigation was a legal matter with the eventual crafting of the NDA.

There are a lot of motivations for NDAs of this kind. Trump was married. He was the host of a hit television show (with a clause on termination for scandalous conduct). And, yes, he was also seeking to be president. He wanted these stories killed and friends like David Pecker were helping in that effort. What those facts say about the former president’s “character” will remain a matter of public debate and, as Romney said, most long ago reached their own conclusions. Yet, it is the crime not the character of Trump that is at issue in Manhattan.

Alvin Bragg would like the trial to remain a verdict on character, which is why he started the trial discussing not the Daniels matter but an uncharged affair and settlement with a former Playboy bunny.It is why he fought hard (and succeeded) in being able to question Trump about past cases involving an alleged assault and fraudulent conduct. As legal experts continue this week to debate if there is even a crime alleged in the indictment, Bragg is making a case that Trump’s lack of character is beyond a reasonable doubt.

To be fair, Romney was not giving a full interview on the case in his statement to CNN and may well have some reservations about the Bragg indictment. However,Bragg is likely hoping that “everybody has made their own assessment of President Trump,” including twelve jurors currently sitting in the Manhattan courtroom.

2024-04-24 10:20:00,Germany Arrests Unprecedented Six Spies In Less Than A Week,https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/germany-arrests-unprecedented-six-spies-less-week,"German security services say they've arrested an unprecedentedsix suspected spies in only the past week, and four of these are believed to have been working for the government of China, while the othertwo are suspected Russian agents.

As we reportedearlier, the latest case unveiled Tuesday centered on a staffer who worked for a high profile German AfD member of European Parliament. Identified only as Jian G., he had reportedly been a staff member for German MEP Maximilian Krah going back to 2019. ""In January 2024 the accused repeatedly shared information about negotiations and decisions in the European Parliament with his intelligence service employer,"" the prosecutorsoffice said.

The day prior, Monday, sawthree Germany citizens accused of having ties with Chinese intelligencearrested. Their case appears even more serious as it involves accusations that theytransported sensitive technologyto China which has potential military uses, violating Germany's export laws.

One suspect tried to export a specialized laser without permission, alongside two others - a German couple - who also sought to procure advanced technologies which investigators suspect were to help Chinesenaval development:

The couple allegedly set up a research transfer agreement with an unidentified German university, the first step in which was to draw up a study for a Chinese partner on thetechnology of machine parts that could be used for powerful ship engines, including those in battleships. Thomas R.'s handler at the MSS was behind the Chinese partner and the project was financed by the Chinese state, prosecutors said.

At the time of the arrests, the suspects were in negotiations on further research projects that could beuseful for expanding China's naval combat strength, they added.

Thomas Haldenwang, president of Germany's domestic intelligence service, said following the detentions: ""We initiated these investigations, and once the evidence was clear, we were able to hand this case over to the police and the public prosecutors,""accordingto told DW.

And head of the Parliamentary Control Committee for the Intelligence Services in the lower house, the Bundestag, said, ""We must finally understand that this is a very serious and very real threat to our security."" He added, ""We must act quickly and decisively both through criminal prosecution and by uncovering the structures and networks.""

According to more from Germany federalprosecutors:

One of the suspects, identified only as Thomas R. in line with German privacy laws, was allegedly an agent for an employee of China's Ministry of State Security and procured information in Germany on ""militarily usable innovative technologies"" for that person, federal prosecutors said in a statement.

The three suspects had reportedly been working on expanding their research contacts and endeavors reportedly in hopes of procuring further sensitive technologies which might be useful for the Chinese government.

The timing of this significant spy round-up involving China came at an interesting moment - justa week following the three day visit of Chancellor Olaf Scholz to China. It was his second trip there since taking office in 2021. Germany officials have refused to comment on whether he knew of the investigation or how far it had progressed at the time he made this latest trip.

Truly a fascinating coincidence that literally days after Scholtz comes back from a trip to China that was viewed as successful in resetting the relationship, they suddenly find all those Chinese spies in Germany.Almost as if someone was trying to unset the reset... but here I…https://t.co/VKSGsRf8N7

As for the pair of alleged Russian spies, they areGerman-Russian citizenswho were arrested in Bayreuth, northern Bavaria. They are believed to have been monitoring US Army bases in Germany, particularly ones connected with Pentagon programs to train Ukrainian troops. ABBC reportsays it went beyond even scouting secretive facilities, but that the spy duo had plans to conduct. Investigators cited ""preparing explosive and arson attacks, especially on military and industrial infrastructure. Dieter S is said to have scouted potential targets including US military facilities, taking photos and videos and handing the information to the Russian contact.""

And more: ""According to the Spiegel website, a US Army facility at Grafenwöhr in Bavaria was spied on. Last year, the US sent dozens of Abrams battle tanks to Bavaria for Ukrainian soldiers to train on at Grafenwöhr and another base at Hohenfels before the tanks were sent to the front line in Ukraine.""

Both Russia and China have of late sought to dismiss allegations of significant foreign spy rings in the heart of Europe as but political propaganda and attempts to gain leverage.

2024-04-24 10:38:06,"WTI Jumps After Bigger-Than-Expected Crude Inventory Build, Gasoline Demand (Reportedly) Slumps",https://web.archive.org/web/20240424143834/https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/wti-jumps-after-bigger-expected-crude-inventorybuild#comment-stream,"Oil prices are drifting lower this morning, despiteAPI reporting a surprise crude inventory draw last night, as hopes that geopolitical tensions are easing (hope is not a strategy) combined with a reduced expectation of economy-juicing rate-cuts are weighing on crude prices.

Supporting the upside, the US Senate, meanwhile, passed tougher measures against Iran in response to its attack on Israel earlier this month, with President Joe Biden saying he’ll sign the legislation into law. But the market is clearly calling Biden's bluff on this threat as he faces soaring pump prices domestically which will do nothing to help his ""but I fixed inflation"" narrative into the election...

However, for now, all eyes are on the official inventory and supply data for any signs of overall tightness, and refined products demand as the summer driving season is fast approaching.

Crude -3.23mm (+500k exp)

Gasoline -595k (-1.5mm exp)

Distillates +724k (-1.0mm exp)

Crude -6.4mm (+500k exp)

Gasoline -634k (-1.5mm exp)

Distillates +1.6mm (-1.0mm exp)

Confirming API's report, the official data showed crude inventories plunging last week by the most since January. On the product side, it was mixed with gasoline drawing down by distillates building...

There was a909k b/d drop in the adjustment factor versus last week, the biggest decline since February,coinciding with the big increase in crude exports. At 257k b/d this week’s balancing measure was pretty small by its own highly volatile standards.

The Biden admin added 793k barrels to the SPR last week - the largest addition since January... and probably the last!

Implied gasoline demand fell yet again, nearly slipping back below 2022 seasonal levels for the first time since early March.

The figure typically sees decent growth at this point in the year, yet a post-Spring Break slump appears to have become the norm since 2020.

In comparison to pre-pandemic demand, the figure is at its lowest since 2014.

US crude production was flat at 13.1mm b/d (near record highs) and we note a very modest rise in rig count trends starting...

WTI was trading around $83.00 ahead of the API data and jumped back into the green for the day after the crude draw...

The conflict in the Middle East has ""undoubtedly exacerbated tensions in an already volatile region,""Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, told MarketWatch.

""While the recent attacks have been downplayed, the potential for further escalation cannot be entirely dismissed.""

However, ""there's a lesson to be gleaned from this situation, particularly in how swiftly demand responded to higher oil and gasoline prices, as evidenced by the increase in U.S. oil stockpiles,""he said.

Finally,timespreads are signaling tighter conditions,with the gap between Brent’s two nearest contracts widening to $1.05 a barrel in backwardation, a bullish pattern in which the nearer contract trades at a premium to the next in sequence. That compares with 69 cents a week ago.

2024-04-24 11:15:14,Gold Price Just Dropped! What Happened?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240425111739/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-24/gold-price-just-dropped-what-happened-2024-update,"The gold price recently experienced its most significant intraday loss in nearly two years, prompting questions about its trajectory and its status as an investment. In this video, we delve into the reasons behind the drop and whether gold remains a viable investment option.

Despite the recent pullback, we maintain our bullish outlook on gold. Pullbacks are a natural part of a long-term uptrend, and historical patterns suggest that gold may still reach new highs this year. The fundamentals supporting gold, such as inflation and geopolitical tensions, remain intact.

The current decline in gold prices can be attributed to profit-taking by futures traders and some market uncertainty. However, this should not overshadow the broader bullish trends in the gold market.

Factors such as rising bond yields, a strengthening U.S. dollar, and shifting expectations regarding Federal Reserve interest rate cuts have contributed to the recent downturn. Nonetheless, the long-term outlook for gold remains positive, especially considering escalating U.S. debt levels and continued central bank demand for gold as a reserve asset.

While short-term market fluctuations may cause concern, gold's status as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation remains unchanged. Investors may consider utilizing strategies like dollar-cost averaging to capitalize on potential buying opportunities presented by market dips.

For more insights on why we believe the gold rally will persist, watch our related video. Additionally, learn about our GoldSaver program, which enables investors to spread out their gold purchases over time for a disciplined approach to investing in gold.

LGBTQ™ Propaganda Roundup: Nip/tucking the latest social engineering fisted from on high upon the American public.

ViaReduxx(emphasis added):

“TheGerman Parliament, or Bundestag,passedone of the world’s most far-reachingsex self-determination policieson April 12, despite protests from women’s rights campaigners.The Self-Determination Act(SBGG) establishes ‘gender identity’ as a protected characteristic andallows parents to change the sex marker on their children’s documents from birth.*

Supported by Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s three-party coalition and promoted and supported by the Socialist Democratic Party (SDP), theSBGG also creates the potential for citizens to be fined up to €10,000 (approx. $10,800 USD) for revealing a person’s given nameand birth sex without their permission – an action that trans activists staunchly oppose and refer to as ‘deadnaming.’

But arguably the most troubling aspect of the law relates to a portion ofthe billwhichpermits parents to alter the recorded sex of children beginning from birth. From the age of five years old, it allows for name and sex changes if there is ‘mutual consent’ between the child and their parents.

According to a description of the bill on the Bundestag’s official website, the Self-Determination Act was designed “to implement a core idea of ​​the Basic Law, the protection of gender identity, by giving people the opportunity to change their gender entry and first name without discrimination.””

In addition to Social Justice™ ideology failing to comport with any semblance of objective reality, it’s also totally lacking in internal logical coherence based on its own tenets. (Some might say the brutalization of logic is part of the point, so as to render any kind of rationality among its adherents impossible and therefore malleable blobs.)

These two things, we are expected to believe, are true at the same time:

·       Children must be trusted to “trans themselves,” granted ultimate decision-making authority over their own “gender identity”

·       Parents and the state are now allowed toassignchildren alternative genders at birth, when the baby bestowed with its new identity has no power of speech or agency whatsoever

A tangled web they weave, indeed!

Here, putting into proper perspective one nefarious NGO’s activities, is a perfect microcosm of the LGBTQ+++™ social engineering agenda in action.

ViaReduxx(emphasis added):

“Theco-founder and current head of B4U-ACT, Richard Kramer, who uses a pseudonym to conceal his identity, alsohas a long history of pro-pedophilia lobbying and has admitted to having a sexual attraction to boys. Prior to his involvement with B4U-ACT,Kramer operated a website called the Male Homosexual Attraction to Minors Information Center, whichadvocates favorably forwhat Kramer describes as‘feelings of sexual attraction that some men have for underage boys.’The website notes a previous symposiumaddressing the issue of removing ‘gender identity disorder and the paraphilias’ from the DSM.

B4U-ACT has campaigned for years to change and ultimately eliminate the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) entry on pedophilia. During a 2011 symposium titled ‘Pedophilia, Minor-Attracted Persons, and the DSM: Issues and Controversies,’ hosted by B4U-ACT, Kramer used results of anonymous surveys conducted with the participation of members of B4U-ACTin an attempt to establish that pedophilia is an innate identity that emerges in childhood…

B4U-ACT also maintains a robust catalogue of networks within major Universitiesaround the world. On its website, it lists institutions that have carried out research under its guidance or with its cooperation.Much of this research has to do with ending the stigmatization of ‘minor-attracted persons.’”

Related:Social Engineers Repackage, Market Pedophiles As ""Minor Attracted Persons""

FromB4U-Act’s self-description (emphasis added):

“Established in 2003,B4U-ACT is a 501(c)(3) organization run in collaboration between mental health professionals, researchers, and people who are attracted to minors.

B4U-ACT helps mental health professionalsand researchers learn more about attraction to minors and toconsider the effects of stereotyping, stigma, and fear. That way they can be informed before they interact with people who are attracted to minors, and before they talk, write, or make public statements about minor-attracted people.

We also work toward the day when minor-attracted people can find mental health professionals they can trust,so that those in need will be able to find help developing ways of coping withtheir situation orsociety’s attitudes about them, and learn to consider the effects of their actions on themselves and others before they react.”

Note the rhetorical pivot away from protecting children from predators in favor of combatting “stereotyping” and “society’s attitudes” about the pedophiles themselves.

This is how the process — undertaken concurrently in coordinated fashion in the governmental, cultural, and academic spheres — works, exactly in the same way that it works for transgenderism.

Consider that this is a technocratic, top-down social engineering process that is no way, contrary to claims to the contrary, an organic cultural evolution but rather a culturalrevolution:

·       De-pathologization (rewriting the clinical literature to declassify it as a disorder)

·       De-stigmatization

·       Normalization

·       Mandated “tolerance” by law and enforced legal accommodations

2024-04-24 20:50:00,ATF Rule-Change Creates A Trap For The Unwary,https://web.archive.org/web/20240425111739/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/atf-rule-change-creates-trap-unwary,"Authored by Christopher Roach via American Greatness,

On Friday, the 31st anniversary of the massacre of Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, the ATF issued new regulations that make it more difficult to comply with federal laws regulating gun dealing and background checks.

Since the 1930s, federal law hasrequiredgun dealers to be registered as Federal Firearms Licensees (FFL). The requirements hinged on the meaning of “engaged in the business of” gun dealing. This language has always been ambiguous, and there has never been (even after the announcement of the new rules) a true “bright line” that distinguishes when one graduates from selling a few guns from one’s personal collection into full-fledged gun dealing.

The law previously required the primary purpose of sales to be “livelihood and profit.” The new rules reduce the requirements to seeking profit alone, tracking the a congressional amendment to existing law in 2022. The changes are more extensive than the legislative guidance, though, by stating that selling guns in the original packaging or shortly after purchase create a rebuttable presumption of being “engaged in the business.”

The potential risk is substantial, as violations are felonies. Flipping a gun for a price higher than one paid, even if one originally intended to keep it, now may turn one into a dealer, making any such sale unlawful if it does not involve all the licensing and paperwork that govern FFLs.

The new rule is the latest salvo in the ATF’s longstandingwar on gun shows and private transfers. In the 1980s, the ATF wanted to make it easier to become a dealer because that meant fewer private transfers as well as more records and tax revenue. In those days, it only took $10 and filling out some forms to become an FFL. These were sometimes referred to as the “kitchen table” dealers, and the numbers of FFLsincreased substantially.

Then, during the Clinton years, the ATF wanted to limit FFLs, so it began requiring a larger fee as well as a storefront. They realized a lot of guns were being sold by these guys, and these measures cut down FFLs considerably. Clinton thought gun control was a greatwedge issueto peel off suburban moderates from the Republican coalition.

Now, with a Democrat again at the helm, the ATF wants to further limit private sales with the threat of criminal punishment by expanding the definition of gun dealing while leaving it vague enough to dissuade private sales.

Everything under the sun that is collected has a community and events associated with it, and this typically includes shows. Shows are places where people can buy, sell, trade-up, and learn about their hobby. Fishing, boating, cars, coins, beanie babies and every other hobby and collectable has shows.

Gun shows are particularly popular because guns tend to hold their value well, and lots of people collect guns. Since many gun owners are of modest means, many of these guns eventually need to be sold, taken to a pawn shop, or otherwise converted into money after they are purchased. Gun shows allow ordinary people to sell guns to other collectors and enthusiasts, whether they are dealers or not.

While the 1993 Brady Bill mandated FFLs conduct background checks on all transfers, private sales are unregulated. This is sometimes described incorrectly as the “gun show” loophole. Contrary to the propaganda, most sales at gun shows are conducted by FFLs, and all FFL sales include a background check. But, whether conducted at a gun show or a barbeque, private sellers transferring their personal firearms do not have to conduct a background check. As I was told by a cop when I was new to the game, selling a personal gun is like selling a toaster.

While this lack of regulation conjures images of shady back-alley transactions, these sales often involve family and friends, fellow collectors at a gun show, and sales to FFLs, who have already been thoroughly vetted when they were licensed. The only legal requirement is that a gun cannot be knowingly sold or transferred to a felon.

We have heard a lot in recent years about universal background checks as a cure for most criminal misuse of guns. This doesn’t sound crazy on its face. Most people support background checks because they don’t want guns in the hands of criminals and lunatics. Also, background checks are not particularly scary because most gun owners have been through many background checks when buying guns from FFLs or obtaining concealed weapons permits.

Even so, mandatory background checks would prevent the private sales that facilitate gun collecting as a hobby. Moreover, while background checks sound like they would stop illegal guns, theydon’t seem to have much of an impact. There is an extensive black market for guns, and many criminals using guns are already prohibited possessors because of felony records.

One more law is unlikely to stop criminals from getting guns, and the inevitable failure of such a law will be usedto provide support for a national gun registry, which is a necessary precursor to mass confiscation.

Like most gun control laws, reducing crime appears to be a secondary goal of the latest ATF move. But this changewillhave the effect of harassing and dissuading gun enthusiasts. The new and ambiguous regulations will have a chilling effect, making gun owners think twice before liquidating a personal collection or conducting a private sale. This will make gun ownership more expensive and less inviting to newcomers.

The law will also, through selective prosecution and strong pressure to turn people into confidential informants, destroy organic gun clubs and friend groups. Facing decades in prison, the pressure put on those caught in the net to become snitches will be tremendous. Government-sponsored sales, entrapment, and the creation of unintentional new criminals may become widespread in the same way italways iswhen federal law enforcement is involved.

The Democratic Left’s continuing pursuit of gun control isa bit of a surprise. In the 1990s, they hypothesized that it would get suburban moms to vote their way, but it has barely moved the dial as a wedge issue. Many thought it backfired,motivating gun owners in certain swing statesto vote Republican.

That said, as with much of the left’s actions in education, popular culture, and sexual mores, any short-term political cost is outweighed by a longer-term and more sinister aspect.In this case, the accretion of rules and uncertainty surrounding gun collecting and trading undermines the networking, organic friendships, and cooperation that allow gun owners to organize and present a real threat to the leviathan state.

2024-04-24 21:10:00,Biden's $60BN Can't Fix Ukraine's Manpower & Recruitment Crisis,https://web.archive.org/web/20240425111739/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/bidens-60bn-cant-fix-ukraines-manpower-recruitment-crisis,"With Biden's $60 billion in funding for Ukraine now fully authorized and implemented, the question isnow what?The US President on Wednesday announced just after signing the bill that the Pentagon will start sending equipment to Ukraine ""in the next few hours"" straight from the US stockpile.

The Kremlin in response isvowing to push back the front lines deeper into Ukraine, and says that newly infused American weaponswill burn. Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonovhas saidin fresh remarks that ""The American aidwon’t save Zelensky. New weapons will be destroyed, and the special military operation goals will be achieved.""

The diplomat continued, ""the military shipments of the US and its satellites have been burned,are being burned and will be burned by the Russian Armed Forces.""

Wednesday afternoon comments by Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan hailed that the long sought defense aid for Kiev has finally become a reality, but also cautioned that Russiacould still break through Ukrainian defensive positions soon.

""It was a long road to secure this funding, and I have to say standing here today, it was too long, and the consequences of the delay have been felt in Ukraine,"" Sullivan told reporters, and explained that troops have had to resort to rationing ammunition, resulting in lost ground in the east.

""And while today's announcement is very good news for Ukraine, they are still under severe pressure on the battlefield.And it is certainly possible that Russia could make additional tactical gains in the coming weeks,"" he warned.

The reality is that Ukraine is fundamentally sufferinga severe crisis of manpower. This essentially means that even as US weapons and equipment arrive, there are fewer and fewer troops experienced enough to actually man and operate them.

This is a grim trend which has especially been on display this week, for example in a Tuesdayannouncementby  Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who said the government would be cutting off consular services for military-age men living abroad. The move is to encourage them to return home and fight for their country.

""How it looks like now:a man of conscription age went abroad, showed his state that he does not care about its survival, and then comes and wants to receive services from this state,"" the top diplomatwrote on X. ""It does not work this way. Our country is at war.""

""The obligation to update one’s documents with the conscription centers existed even before the new law on mobilization was passed,"" Kuleba also explained. The new policy requires that all men 18 to 60 must update their information with a state office - andif they don't comply then they get cut off from all consular services abroad.

According toThe New York Times, US weapons could start arriving in Ukraine within days. But on parts of the front line, Ukraine's situation is desperate. And it still has a major problem that aid can't fix: a lack of troops.

""The most important source of Ukrainian weakness is thelack of manpower,"" Konrad Muzyka, director of the Rochan military consultancy in Poland, told Reuters.--Business Insider

Meanwhile, inside Ukraine military officials are trying to get creative amid the ongoing manpower shortage.Reutersreports, ""As Ukraine's efforts to conscript enough men to fight Russia are stymied by public skepticism, defense officials and military units are embarking ona multi-pronged charm offensive to recruit a citizens' armyto resist the invasion.""

The “Experts” are finally admitting that Russia is winning the war in Ukraine, but they are still lying about why. The reason is not congressional inaction over further funding. The reason is that Russia has more manpower than Ukraine; it produces more artillery than the West;…pic.twitter.com/TnE7EuLEII

""Thissofter call-upis being conducted on job-search sites and outreach centers, as well as billboards and social media, and offers a wartime novelty: an element of choice,"" the report continues. ""Candidates can select their precise unit and roles suiting their skills, for instance, as well as how long they will serve.""

And yet we are likely to still witness more examples of recruitment officers brutally seizing young men off the streets, as was seen at various times over the course of the first two years of the war.

2024-04-24 21:50:00,Russia Vetoes US-Authored UN Resolution Banning Nuclear Weapons In Space,https://web.archive.org/web/20240425111739/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/russia-vetoes-us-authored-un-resolution-banning-nuclear-weapons-space#comment-stream,"Russia has just vetoed a very rare and interesting resolution set before the United Nations Security Council focused on banning nuclear weaponsin space:

The treaty bars signatories, including the U.S. and Russia, from placing""in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction""or anywhere else in outer space.

On Wednesday Russia registered the lone veto which shot down the draft resolution aimed ultimately at preventing a future nuclear arms race in outer space.

China was the only abstention while the US was among the 13 UNSC members that voted in favor. It had been drafted andbrought forward by the US and Japan.

In February the US government alleged that Russia was preparing to deploy a 'space weapon' which might be nuclear, which subsequently set off a frenzy of media speculation.

Reutershad reported at the time, ""The space-based weapon U.S. intelligence believes Russia may be developing ismore likely a nuclear-powered device to blind, jam or fry the electronics inside satellites than an explosive nuclear warhead to shoot them down, analysts said.""

The Kremlin has blasted what it characterized as a""malicious fabrication"". It claimed US officials were seeking to distract the public and ram through more foreign aid and defense spending in Congress.

The US press release summarizing Wednesday's failed resolution included the followingdescription:

The detonation of a nuclear weapon in space would destroy satellites that are vital to communications, agriculture, national security, and more worldwide, with grave implications for sustainable development, and other aspects of international peace and security. The diverse group of cosponsors of this resolution reflects the strong shared interest inavoiding such an outcome.

Additionally National Security Council spokesman John Kirby warned that in the absence of any international prohibition or treaty, nukes in space could cause""physical destruction"" on Earth.

US Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield after Moscow's no vote lashed out at Russia's ambassador: ""Today's veto begs the question: why? Why, if you are following the rules, would you not support a resolution that reaffirms them?What could you possibly be hiding,"" shesaid.

2024-04-24 22:10:00,Biden Calls For Record High 44.6% Capital Gains Tax Rate,https://web.archive.org/web/20240425111739/https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/biden-calls-record-high-446-capital-gains-tax-rate,"By John Kartch ofAmericans For Tax Reform

President Biden has formally proposed the highest top capital gains tax in over 100 years.

Here is a direct quote from theBiden 2025 budget proposal:“Together, the proposals would increase the top marginal rate on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends to 44.6 percent.”

Yes, you read that correctly: A Biden top capital gains and dividends tax rate of 44.6%.

Under the Biden proposal, the combined federal-state capital gains tax exceeds 50% in many states.California will face a combined federal-state rate of 59%, New Jersey 55.3%, Oregon at 54.5%, Minnesota at 54.4%, and New York state at 53.4%.

Worse, capital gains are not indexed to inflation. So Americans already get stuck paying tax on some “gains” that are not real. It is a tax on inflation, something created by Washington and then taxed by Washington. Biden’s high inflation makes this especially painful.

Many hard working couples who started a small business at age 25 who now wish to sell the business at age 65 will face the Biden proposed 44.6% top rate, plus state capital gains taxes. And much of that “gain” isn’t real due to inflation. But they’ll owe tax on it.

Capital gains taxes are often a form of double taxation. When capital gains come from stocks, stock mutual funds, or stock ETFs, the capital gains tax is a cascaded second layer of tax on top of the current federal corporate income tax of 21%. (Biden has also proposed a corporate income tax hike to 28%).

The proposed Biden top capital gains tax rate is more than twice as high as China’s rate. China’s capital gains tax rate is 20%. Is it wise to have higher taxes than China? And with Biden’s combined federal-state capital gains rate of 59% in California, residents will face a rate nearly three times as high as China.

The capital gains tax was created as its own tax in 1922, at a rate of 12.5%. See the chart below to see how Biden’s proposed capital gains tax for 2025 puts the United States in uncharted territory.

Biden’s proposed capital gains tax hike will also hit many families when parents pass away. Biden has proposed adding a second Death Tax (separate from and in addition to the existing Death Tax) by taking away stepped-up basis when parents die. This would result in a mandatory capital gains tax at death — a forced realization event.

As previously reported byCNBC:

“When someone dies and the asset transfers to an heir, that transfer itself will be a taxable event, and the estate is required to pay taxes on the gains as if they sold the asset,” said Howard Gleckman, senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

Biden’s proposal to take away stepped-up basis has already been tried, and it failed: In 1976 congress eliminated stepped-up basis but it was so complicated and unworkable it was repealed before it took effect.

As noted in a July 3, 1979 New York Timesarticle, it was “impossibly unworkable.”

“Almost immediately, however, the new law touched off a flood of complaints as unfair and impossibly unworkable. So many, in fact, that last year Congress retroactively delayed the law’s effective date until 1980 while it struggled again with the issue.“

As noted by the NYT, intense voter blowback ensued:

“Not only were there protests from people who expected the tax to fall on them — family businesses and farms, in particular — bankers and estate lawyers also complained that the rule was a nightmare of paperwork.“

Biden’s 2025 budget calls for about$5 trillion in tax increasesover the next decade.

2024-04-24 22:30:00,"Are Pro-Palestinian Protests Being Hijacked By Marxists To ""Destroy Capitalism, Freedom & Democracy""?",https://web.archive.org/web/20240425111739/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/are-pro-palestinian-protests-being-hijacked-marxists-destroy-capitalism-freedom-democracy#comment-stream,"Just over a week ago, we asked our readers a very straightforward question:Who is funding this chaos?This question followed incidents where pro-Palestinian protesters disrupted critical infrastructure, such as shutting down airport terminals, blocking bridges, causing major traffic congestion on highway arteries, and targeting the distribution networks of major corporations.

So, what does shutting down critical infrastructure have to do with helping poor Palestinian children?It has absolutely nothing and more to do with a Marxist movement, similar to the Black Lives Matter movement several years ago, with the one goal to crash the US economy, destroy freedom, and abolish democracy.

Mike Shelby, a former military intelligence non-commissioned officer and contractor, and now the CEO of intelligence services companyForward Observer, sheds more color on a leftist revolutionary group that is very active today and responsible for some of the chaos in 2020 called ""A15.""

""A15 is actually a reprise of efforts from Antifa and the far-left revolutionary class we saw in 2020. these activists and militants were making plans to oust then-President Donald Trump if he stayed in office,"" Shelby wrote on X.

A15 is actually a reprise of efforts from antifa and the far left revolutionary class we saw in 2020.these activists and militants were making plans to oust then-President Donald Trump if he stayed in office.

He said, ""Their plan was to effectively shut down the US economy to force Trump out of the White House,"" adding, ""Activists publicly stated they would keep the economy disrupted until Trump caved to public pressure and resigned."" He warned, ""That was their plan and probably still is.""

their plan was to effectively shut down the u.s. economy to force trump out of the white house.activists publicly stated they would keep the economy disrupted until trump caved to public pressure and resigned.that was their plan and probably still is.

Shelby said the group has circulated literature on critical chokepoints that, if hit by an attack, could trigger a massive shock to the US economy.

starting in january 2020, far left militants began circulating a pamphlet called “Chokepoints in a Fragile Network” (image below)pic.twitter.com/S4oosYq2YY

He continued: ""A15 is connected to the Tides Center + Foundation -- the social justice organization central to the 2020 uprisings -- through ActBlue, a political action committee and fundraising arm for the democratic party.""

A15 is connected to the Tides Center + Foundation -- the social justice organization central to the 2020 uprisings -- through ActBlue, a political action committee and fundraising arm for the democratic party.

Shelby warned with the ""2024 election less than 7 months away,"" there are mounting risks of ""mass mobilizations"" of these bad actors.

A15 matters because the 2024 election is less than 7 months away.mass mobilizations aren't something you ""cold start"" in november.organizations have to start applying accelerators of conflict to turn the temperature up.A15 is just a vehicle for the broader movement.

As Marxist revolutionary groups plot their next attacks on critical infrastructure, we would like to remind readers about the surge in news stories in recent years about train derailments, food processing fires, power grid disruptions, and other incidents on critical infrastructure, which some seemed like accidents - but it's not against the law to question if these mysterious incidents were attempts by leftist groups to disrupt the economy. Even one month after the container ship slammed into a bridge in Baltimore and collapsed, it's still not against the law to question if that was an attack on America's infrastructure by foreign adversaries.

According to Bloomberg data, headlines in the corporate press featuring train derailments have surged over the last 4.5 years.

Coincidence, who knows?

Let's gravitate back to pro-Palestinian protests that have a weird obsession with doing absolutely nothing for the poor Palestinians overseas but more to do with trying to disrupt critical infrastructure.

Former US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman recently warned on X that these protests have ""nothing to do with Israel or the Palestinians—most of the protesters are entirely ignorant of those issues.""

Friedman continued, ""It is a Marxist movement to destroy capitalism, freedom and democracy. The protesters have cleverly hijacked a complex issue and tapped in to the ever-present vein of antisemitism.""

""Make no mistake, these Marxists are not just after Israel. Their real goal is to destroy our Western values and way of life,"" Friedman concluded.

Besides A15, we recently pointed out that a little-known international organization called Samidoun could be behind some protests. The Israeli government declared Samidoun a terrorist organization in 2021.

""They support terrorism, and they want to gain public opinion — support — for terrorism,"" Yossi Kuperwasser, the former chief of the research division in the Israel Defense Forces' military intelligence unit, recently said.

Who is funding this chaos that appears to be ramping up ahead of summer? Is it dark Soros money or Gulf sources?

Also, why is Biden's Department of Justice publicly silent on this increasing national security threat?

EMPs (Electromagnetic Pulse) are a trope that is often used in prepper fiction.

We often think of an EMP attack as the worst-case, end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scenario that is just around the corner.

There’s little doubt that it would change everything, but what’s the truth?

Nobody knows this better than Dr. Arthur T. Bradley. Dr Bradley is a NASA engineer and the leading expert on EMPs in the preparedness community. He’s the author ofHandbook to Practical Disaster Preparednessand the must-haveDisaster Preparedness for EMPs and Solar Storms. I’ve had the opportunity to speak with him before myself, and you couldn’t ask for a nicer, more down-to-earth person. He really knows what he’s talking about and he shares information without hyperbole. He is the person I trust the most for information in this genre.

In this compelling interview, Brian Duff interviews Dr. Bradley to get the real answers. If you want to separate fact from fiction, watch this video.

2024-04-24 23:30:00,Divide And Conquer: The Government's Propaganda Of Fear And Fake News,https://web.archive.org/web/20240425111739/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/divide-and-conquer-governments-propaganda-fear-and-fake-news,"Authored by John and Nisha Whitehead via The Rutherford Institute,

“It is the function of mass agitation to exploit all the grievances, hopes, aspirations, prejudices, fears, and ideals of all the special groups that make up our society, social, religious, economic, racial, political.Stir them up. Set one against the other. Divide and conquer.That’s the way to soften up a democracy.”

- J. Edgar Hoover, Masters of Deceit

“Nothing is real,”observed John Lennon, and that’s especially true of politics.

Much like the fabricated universe in Peter Weir’s 1998 filmThe Truman Show, in which a man’s life is the basis for an elaborately staged television show aimed at selling products and procuring ratings, the political scene in the United States has devolved over the years into a carefully calibrated exercise in how to manipulate, polarize, propagandize and control a population.

Take the media circus that is the Donald Trumphush money trial, which panders to the public’s voraciousappetite for titillating, soap opera drama, keeping the citizenrydistracted, diverted and divided.

This is the magic of the reality TV programming that passes for politics today.

Everything becomes entertainment fodder.

As long as we are distracted, entertained, occasionally outraged, always polarized but largely uninvolved and content to remain in the viewer’s seat, we’ll never manage to present a unified front against tyranny (or government corruption and ineptitude) in any form.

Studies suggest that the more reality TV people watch—and I would posit that it’s all reality TV, entertainment news included—themore difficult it becomes to distinguishbetween what is real and what is carefully crafted farce.

“We the people” are watching a lot of TV.

On average,Americans spend five hours a daywatching television. By the time we reach age 65, we’re watchingmore than 50 hours of television a week, and that number increases as we get older. And reality TV programming consistently captures thelargest percentage of TV watchersevery season by an almost 2-1 ratio.

This doesn’t bode well for a citizenry able to sift through masterfully-produced propaganda in order to think critically about the issues of the day.

Yet look behind the spectacles, the reality TV theatrics, the sleight-of-hand distractions and diversions, and the stomach-churning, nail-biting drama that is politics today, and you will find there is a method to the madness.

We have become guinea pigs in a ruthlessly calculated, carefully orchestrated, chillingly cold-blooded experiment in how to control a population and advance a political agenda without much opposition from the citizenry.

This is how you persuade a populace to voluntarily march in lockstep with a police state and police themselves (and each other): by ratcheting up the fear-factor, meted out one carefully calibrated crisis at a time, and teaching them to distrust any who diverge from the norm through elaborate propaganda campaigns.

Unsurprisingly, one of thebiggest propagandiststoday is the U.S. government.

Add the government’s inclinationto monitor online activity and police so-called “disinformation,”and you have the makings of a restructuring of reality straight out of Orwell’s1984, where the Ministry of Truth polices speech and ensures that facts conform to whatever version of reality the government propagandists embrace.

This “policing of the mind” is exactly the danger author Jim Keith warned about when he predicted that “information and communication sources are gradually being linked together into a single computerized network, providing an opportunity for unheralded control of what will be broadcast, what will be said, and ultimately what will be thought.”

You may not hear much about the government’s role in producing, planting and peddling propaganda-driven fake news—often with the help of the corporate news media—because the powers-that-be don’t want us skeptical of the government’s message or itscorporate accomplices in the mainstream media.

However, when you have social media giants colluding with the government in order to censor so-called disinformation, all the while the mainstream news media, which is supposed to act as a bulwark against government propaganda, has instead become the mouthpiece of the world’s largest corporation (the U.S. government),theDeep State has grown dangerously out-of-control.

This has been in the works for a long time.

Veteran journalist Carl Bernstein, in his expansive 1977Rolling Stonepiece“The CIA and the Media,”reported on Operation Mockingbird, a CIA campaign started in the 1950s to plant intelligence reports among reporters at more than 25 major newspapers and wire agencies, who would then regurgitate them for a public oblivious to the fact that they were being fed government propaganda.

In some instances, as Bernsteinshowed, members of the media also served as extensions of the surveillance state, with reporters actually carrying out assignments for the CIA. Executives with CBS, theNew York TimesandTimemagazine also worked closely with the CIA to vet the news.

If it was happening then, you can bet it’s still happening today,only this collusion has been reclassified, renamed and hidden behind layers of government secrecy, obfuscation and spin.

In its article, “How the American government is trying to control what you think,” theWashington Postpoints out“Government agencies historically have made a habit of crossing the blurry line between informing the public and propagandizing.”

This is mind-control in its most sinister form.

The end goal of these mind-control campaigns—packaged in the guise of the greater good—is to see how far the American people will allow the government to go in re-shaping the country in the image of a totalitarian police state.

The government’s fear-mongering is a key element in its mind-control programming.

It’s a simple enough formula. National crises, global pandemics, reported terrorist attacks, and sporadic shootings leave us in a constant state of fear. The emotional panic that accompanies fear actually shuts down the prefrontal cortex or the rational thinking part of our brains. In other words,when we are consumed by fear, we stop thinking.

A populace that stops thinking for themselves is a populace that is easily led, easily manipulated andeasily controlledwhether through propaganda, brainwashing, mind control, or just plain fear-mongering.

Fear not only increases the power of government, but it also divides the people into factions, persuades them to see each other as the enemy and keeps them screaming at each other so that they drown out all other sounds. In this way, they will never reach consensus about anything and will be too distracted to notice the police state closing in on them until the final crushing curtain falls.

This Machiavellian scheme has so ensnared the nation that few Americans even realize they are being brainwashed—manipulated—into adopting an “us” against “them” mindset. All the while, those in power—bought and paid for by lobbyists and corporations—move their costly agendas forward.

This unseen mechanism of society that manipulates us through fear into compliance is what American theorist Edward L. Bernays referred to as “an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.”

It was almost 100 years ago when Bernays wrote his seminal workPropaganda:

“We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of... In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.”

To this invisible government of rulers who operate behind the scenes—the architects of the Deep State—we are mere puppets on a string, to be brainwashed, manipulated and controlled.

All of the distracting, disheartening, disorienting news you are bombarded with daily isbeing driven by propagandachurned out by one corporate machine (the corporate-controlled government) and fed to the American people by way of yet another corporate machine (the corporate-controlled media).

“For the first time in human history, there is a concerted strategy to manipulate global perception. And the mass media are operating as its compliant assistants, failing both to resist it and to expose it,”writes investigative journalist Nick Davies.

So where does that leave us?

Americans should beware of letting others—whether they be television news hosts, political commentators or media corporations—do their thinking for them.

A populace that cannot think for themselves is a populace with its backs to the walls: mute in the face of elected officials who refuse to represent us, helpless in the face of police brutality, powerless in the face of militarized tactics and technology that treat us like enemy combatants on a battlefield, and naked in the face of government surveillance that sees and hears all.

As I make clear in my bookBattlefield America: The War on the American Peopleand in its fictional counterpartThe Erik Blair Diaries,it’s time to change the channel, tune out the reality TV show, and push back against the real menace of the police state.

If not, if we continue to sit back and lose ourselves in political programming, we will remain a captive audience to a farce that grows more absurd by the minute.

2024-04-25 02:00:00,Iran Vs Israel: What Happens Next Now That Shots Have Been Fired?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240425111739/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/iran-vs-israel-what-happens-next-now-shots-have-been-fired,"Authored by Brandon Smith via Alt-Market.us,

In October of 2023 in my article‘It’s A Trap! The Wave Of Repercussions As The Middle East Fights “The Last War”’I predicted that a multi-front war was about to develop between Israel and various Muslim nations including Lebanon and Iran. I noted:

“Israel is going to pound Gaza into gravel, there’s no doubt about that. A ground invasion will meet far more resistance than the Israelis seem to expect, but Israel controls the air and Gaza is a fixed target with limited territory. The problem for them is not the Palestinians, but the multiple war fronts that will open up if they do what I think they are about to do (attempted sanitization). Lebanon, Iran and Syria will immediately engage and Israel will not be able to fight them all…”

So far, both Lebanon and Iran have directly engaged Israeli military forces and civilian targets. Syrian militias are also declaring they will once again start attacking US military bases in the region. In my article‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’published on April 5th I noted that:

“I warned months ago…that the war in Gaza would expand into a multi-front conflict that would probably include Iran. I also warned that it would be to Israel’s benefit if Iran entered the war because this would eventually force the US to become directly involved. To be sure, Iran has already been engaging in proxy attacks on Israel through Lebanon, but Israel’s attack on the Iranian “embassy” or diplomatic station in Syria basically ensures that Iran will now directly commit to strikes on Israeli targets.”

Iran did indeed commit to a large scale missile and drone based attack on Israel, a situation which has had some curious consequences. Of course, US naval forces aided Israel’s Iron Dome in shooting down the majority of drones and missiles sent by Iran. However, even though there are several videos showing that some cruise missiles hit their targets, the Israelis have been reticent to admit that any damage was done.

I suspect it’s because the cruise missiles struck military targets instead of civilian targets and Israel doesn’t want to release any information on what was hit. Iran’s drones were likely meant to act as decoys for anti-air defenses. They are much cheaper than the missiles used by Israel and the US to shoot them down.

Whether or not these strikes had any real affect on Israeli offensive capabilities we’ll probably never know. What we do know is that Israel’s counter-strike was much smaller than most analysts expected.Does this mean that the tit-for-tat is over and both sides are going hands-off? That would probably be the smart decision, but no, that’s not what’s happening here.

Israel’s limited response was likely due to a lack of clarity on how much the US government under Biden is willing to participate in the war during an election year.What we will see in the next six months is a steady escalation towards winter,followed by new bombardments with far more extensive destruction than we recently witnessed.

In other words,spring is just the dress rehearsal for what will happen in winter.

Here are the most probable scenarios as 2024 rolls forward…

I have little doubt that Israel will commit to extensive aerial strikes on Iran this year or very early in 2025, and we’ll see very quickly if Russian air defense technology sold to the Iranians is effective or ineffective. Iran’s drone program may be useful in helping to even the playing field against Israeli fighter jets, but then again, the technology gap could be extensive.

The Israeli public position will be that their strikes are focused on taking down any existing Iranian nuclear labs. There is no solid evidence that Iran has made much headway in developing nukes (they might have dirty bombs), but the notion of nukes is more than enough in terms of public relations and justification for the war.

The Strait of Hormuz would be at the top of the list of primary targets for Iran. It is the narrowest point of access to the Persian Gulf and oversees the passage of around 25%-30% of the world’s total oil exports. Blocking it is relatively easy – All Iran has to do is sink a few tankers into the shallow waters or destroy enemy ships passing through, creating a barrier that will make transport of oil impossible.

This would also make naval operations for Israel or the US difficult. Clearing obstructions would take time and expose forces to Iranian artillery which can be fired from up to 450 miles away. Once artillery is locked in on a narrow point or pasage, nothing is going to get through. As we’ve seen in Ukraine, a blanket of artillery fire is essentially unstoppable.

Anti-ship missiles wouldn’t even be necessary and would probably prove less effective, unless they are hypersonic. Iran can also utilize its small fleet of diesel submarines to deploy naval mines in the strait.

Once the Hormuz is disrupted and global oil shipments slow down the US military will join the war if they haven’t done so already.

A ground war between Iran and Israel is inevitable if the tit-for-tat continues, and much of it will be fought (at least in the beginning) in Lebanon and perhaps Syria. Iran has a mutual defense pact with both countries and Lebanon is generally a proxy for Iranian defense policy.

Iran will have active troops or proxy forces in all of these regions, not to mention the Houthis in Yemen striking ships in the Red Sea. There are questions in terms of how Iraq will respond to this situation, but there’s not a lot of love between the current government and Israel or the US.

The Iraq government did not initially condemn the attack by Hamas against Israel on October 7th and has voiced support for the Palestinians in Gaza. It’s unlikely that they would willingly allow the use of their territory for projecting an offensive against Iran. The use of Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti territory is possible for invasion IF the US gets involved, and the Persian Gulf would be a primary point of attack. But, both the US and Israel lack enough regional bases needed to project large scale ground forces into Iran (keep in mind that bases in Afghanistan are now gone).

Turkey is another staging ground for US forces but they certainly don’t like Israel, meaningTurkey is going to be off limits. Like Iraq, I think it will be difficult to convince Turkey, a vocal defender of Gaza, to support an invasion force or exploit their border for operations.

What about Pakistan? No, not a chance. It’s important to remember that many of these nations have worked with the US in the past, but they have angry populations to deal with. Support for an attack on Iran could lead to civil unrest at home.

The war would mostly be fought by air and by sea with US and Israel seeking to dominate the Persian Gulf. A lot of the ground fighting will be done in neighboring countries. A direct invasion of Iran would be an exhaustive affair with mountain terrain that must be reached by going through allied territories.

Can it be done? Yes. Could the US and Israel/allies win? Yes, as long as the goal is destruction and not occupation. Would it be costly? Absolutely. Far too costly to be acceptable to the western public these days, and a war that would require extensive military recruitment or a draft which Americans in particular will not tolerate.

Think gas prices are high now? Just wait until 25% of the world oil exports are locked out of the market for months at a time. We might see double the prices at the pump; perhaps even triple, and that’s not counting the inflationary conditions already ongoing in the west.

This would be a disaster for the economy as energy prices affect EVERYTHING else. Costs on the shelf will climb right along with oil.

Below the surface, there are many benefits to expanding the war in the Middle East for the globalists. War can be blamed for the inflationary collapse they created. War can be used as an excuse to implement even more aggressive censorship standards in Europe and the US. War can be used to create a military draft which will trigger great unrest in the US and some parts of the EU. War could invariably be used to rationalize martial law. And, it could even be used to stall or disrupt elections.

At bottom, the war in Ukraine, the war in the Middle East and the many other regional wars that will probably erupt in the next few years have a cumulative effect that causes confusion and chaos. All that is needed is a short period of disarray and a lot of economic panic and the public may even forget who created the mess in the first place Liberty activists caught in the middle of these events will take action to defend their freedoms, and I have no doubt we will be accused of “aiding foreign enemies” or working as “agents of the Russians, Iranians, etc.”

Given that NATO has seen fit to engage in a proxy war in Ukraine it makes sense that Russia would return the favor and engage in a proxy war in Iran. Don’t be surprised to see a lot of discussion in the media in the coming months about Russian “advisers” in Iran as well as Russian weaponry. Russia already has military bases in Syria and defense agreements with Iran. It would appear that the US and allies are being set on a collision course with Russia that will lead to direct kinetic interactions.

At this stage world war will already be well underway. Russia and the US may never actually try to strike each other’s territory and nuclear exchange makes little sense for anyone (especially the globalists who would lose their financial and surveillance empire in the blink of an eye) but they will be fighting each other in regional wars in multiple spots across the globe. It seems to me that this process has already been set in motion, and once the avalanche starts, it’s very hard to stop.

And thus, theWorld Happiness Reportwas born.

In 2012, the first report released, examining Gallup poll data from 2006–2010 that asked respondents in nearly every country to evaluate their life on a 0–10 scale. From this they extrapolated a single “happiness score” out of 10 to compare how happy countries are.

More than a decade later, the2024 World Happiness Reportcontinues the mission to quantify, measure, and compare well-being. Its latest findings also include how countries have becomehappierin the intervening years.

Visual Capitalist's Pallavi Rao visualizes these findings in the chart below, which shows the 20 countries that have seen their happiness scores grow the most since 2010.

Serbialeads a list of 12 Eastern European nations whose average happiness score has improved more than 20% in the last decade.

In the same time period, theSerbian economyhas doubled to $80 billion, and its per capita GDP has nearly doubled to $9,538 in current dollar terms.

Since the first report, Western Europe has on average been happier than Eastern Europe. But as seen with these happiness gains, Eastern Europe is now seeing their happiness levels converge closer to their Western counterparts. In fact, when looking at those under the age of 30, the most recent happiness scores are nearly the same across the continent.

All in all,20 countrieshave increased their happiness score by a full point or more since 2010, on the 0–10 scale.

2024-04-25 03:30:00,"UK Government-Funded Trans-Lobbyist Group Calls Puberty Blockers ""Wonderful""",https://web.archive.org/web/20240425111739/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/uk-government-funded-trans-lobbyist-group-calls-puberty-blockers-wonderful#comment-stream,"Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news,

A government funded LGBT activist group that is active in more than half of Scotland’s schools has called puberty blocking drugs, which effectively sterilise children, “wonderful.”

LGBT Youth Scotland, which is registered as a charity, has also declared that children should have the “autonomy” to decide whether to take puberty blockers without the views of their parents interfering.

The group, which receives almost £1 million per year in taxpayer funding, issued a statement in opposition to a decision tosuspend the prescription of the drugs to childrenby the country’s gender reassignment centre, Sandyford Clinic in Glasgow.

The Telegraphreportsthat LGBT Youth Scotland’s Trans Rights Youth Commission declared“We would like to be clear about the wonderful impacts that accessing gender affirming care can have,”adding“Gender affirming care is about our right to do what we want with our own body. It is freedom. We deeply urge Sandyford to reconsider this decision.”

Yesterday,@JennyGilruthdefended the presence of this rogue charity in Scottish schools. They have repaid her by calling puberty blockers 'wonderful' &, disturbingly, calling for “bodily autonomy” for young children.They are a safeguarding nightmare.https://t.co/Fadx7V5FUF

The comments come in the wake of a major long term study in the UK that concluded that treatment gender-confused children have been offered was built entirely on “shaky foundations” and that there is “no good evidence to support the global clinical practice of prescribing hormones to under-18s to pause puberty or transition to the opposite sex.”

The review also noted possible risks such as infertility and damage to brain function and growth.

The author of the review, retired consultant paediatrician Dr Cass, formerly the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics, called the evidence for life altering drugs “remarkably weak” and warned that transgender activists are the ones“deliberately spread(ing) misinformation.”

Since the review was published, Cass has been subject to abuse and cannot use public transport over fears for her safety.

As we highlighted last week, LGBT Youth Scotland is also encouraging teachers in Scottish schools not to communicate with parents if their children express a desire to ‘transition’ to a different gender.

It was alsorevealed earlier last weekthat schools signed up to the LGBT Youth Scotland charter scheme are appointing children as “LGBT champions” and being encouraged to question pupils about their sexual orientation and gender.

Scottish primary schools appoint children as young as FOUR as 'LGBT Champions'https://t.co/tXLhur4fSi

Earlier this week, Scotland’s education secretary Jenny Gilruth, defended the group as helping to create “inclusive” environments, and said that it is up to schools whether they sign up for the charter scheme.

Jenny Gilruth refused to answer whether LGBT Youth Scotland, whose remit is young people between 13 and 25, was working in primary schools with kids as young as 2. But we know it is. So why is the Scottish Government trying to keep it secret?https://t.co/aUhp7RkFGcpic.twitter.com/LcLU6xb0Bq

Scottish Conservative deputy leader Meghan Gallacher hit back noting that parents have been “outraged” by “cult like” materials distributed by LGBT Youth Scotland, and pointing to an account of one parent who claimed herdaughter had been “radicalised”by trans ideology after her school became involved with the group.

'My daughter was ‘radicalised’ by Scottish LGBT club in school'Read the full story below 👇https://t.co/y7MG7U2c3n

The account notes that the child’s decision to begin identifying as male was kept from the parents by the school, but that the girl soon reverted after being sent to a private school in England.

Gallacher urged that “LGBT Youth Scotland’s ideological and dogmatic response to the Cass review sums up why many are extremely concerned about their continued influence on kids in our schools.”

On top of all this, LGBT Youth Scotland was recently embroiled in a scandal with one of its employees under investigation for alleged grooming and child sex abuse:

1./ A charity that sheltered leading figures in the biggest and most appalling paedophile scandal in Scottish criminal history are now invited into primary schools to ask kids if they are gay or trans. Just another average day in SNP(aedo) Scotland. 👇https://t.co/g8j3eL9g6A

We have previously highlighted how radical lobbyist trans activist groups such as Stonewall are injecting LGBTQ+ propaganda into teaching, and even recruiting ‘activist’ teachers to ignore government guidance that has essentially said schools do not have to adopt ‘gender identity ideology’ or recognise ‘social transitions’ among pupils.

These groups masquerading as charities are siphoning taxpayer money to fund their extreme operations, which are directly targeting children.

2024-04-25 04:15:00,I Kant Even: German Chancellor Triggered After Putin Quotes Legendary Philosopher,https://web.archive.org/web/20240425111739/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/i-kant-even-german-chancellor-triggered-after-putin-quotes-legendary-philosopher#comment-stream,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is quite upset, after Vladimir Putin quoted German philosopher Immanuel Kant - who the Russian president called ""one of the greatest thinkers of both his time and ours,"" and said that the philosopher's call ""to live by one's own wits"" is relevant today.

""A country must live by its own wits… This does not mean that we do not care about the interests of others... but we will never allow Russia’s interests to be neglected. In some countries, among our neighbors, this thesis has been forgotten. Many live by someone else’s wits. This will not bring them any good,"" Putin told a group of college students in Kaliningrad - where Kant was born in 1724 (previously known as Königsberg, which belonged to the Kingdom of Prussia before becoming part of the Russian empire).

According to Scholz, ""Putin doesn’t have the slightest right to quote Kant, yet Putin’s regime remains committed to poaching Kant and his work at almost any cost,"" he told an audience at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences,Die Zeitreports.

According to Scholz, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is not in alignment with Kant's teachings - noting that the philosopher spoke of the interference of states in the affairs of other nations. He also defended Ukraine's decision not to enter into peace talks with Moscow, and that 'forced treaties' could not achieve 'perpetual peace' - something Kant spoke of.

Putin has praised Kant over the years- suggesting in 2013 that he should be made an official symbol of the Kaliningrad Region.

Kaliningrad administrators hit backat Scholz' comments - saying in a Tuesday statement that nobody has done more than Russia to ""perpetuate the memory of the great philosopher and his teachings,"" adding ""Immanuel Kant died as a subject of the Russian crown. It seems to me that this, more than any words of all possible German politicians, shows the position of the great philosopher regarding Russia.""

Kant was born in 1724 and died in 1804, and spent his entire life in Königsberg. During his later years, specifically from 1758 until his death, Königsberg and the entirety of East Prussia temporarily came under Russian control due to the events of the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). Although Prussia regained control over Königsberg after the war, Kant's status during those specific years was technically as a subject of the Russian Empire.

2024-04-25 05:00:00,Will The Anglo-American Axis Really Deploy Nukes To Poland?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240425111739/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/will-anglo-american-axis-really-deploy-nukes-poland,"Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

Polish President Andrzej Dudaconfirmedin an interview during his latest trip to the US that“If our allies decide to deploy nuclear weapons as part of nuclear sharing also on our territory to strengthen the security of NATO's eastern flank, we are ready for it. We are an ally in the North Atlantic Alliance, and we also have obligations in this respect, i.e., we simply implement a common policy.”

As a reminder, the Russian Ambassador to Poland toldRTearlier this month that the US has yet to oblige Poland’s offer.

He didn’t elaborate why, but it’s not anything new that Poland wants to host American nukes.The only reason why it’s newsworthy is because his confirmation of this intent comes after his latest trip to the US and ahead of NATO’s next annual summit in early July.

Moreover, if one reads between the lines, his reference to “our allies” as opposed to the US (the specific country whose nukes he wasasked about hostingby his interlocutor) suggests that Poland could possibly host British nukes.

TheAnglo-American Axisworks in tandem to wage NATO’sproxywaron Russia through Ukraine, and each has excellent bilateral ties with Poland.The UK has also shown itself to be more “daring” in terms of openly provoking Russia than the US has as proven by its Storm Shadow cruise missiles and assistance to Ukraine in striking civilian targets like theCrimean Bridgeandcities in Kherson Region. It therefore wouldn’t be far-fetched if they one day deploy their nukes to Poland before the US or instead of it.

Extrapolating the motives at play, the first scenario could be intended to move the needle inside the US in the direction of following suit just like prior weapons deliveries were intended. As for the second, it could be due to the UK’s desire to maintain its “sphere of influence” in the region via “Three Seas Initiative”-leader Polandamidst Germany’s immense gainsthere since its change of government. In that case, the US could approve of it so as to keep Germany’s continental influence in check via the UK.

To be clear, there’s no credible indication that either member of the Anglo-American Axis is interested in deploying nukes to Poland, who’s been asking the US to do so but to no avail.Any positive decision would be driven by purely political motives since there’s no military necessity for adding Poland to the nuclear-sharing program.It would be presented as a tit-for-tat after Russia deployed tactical nukes in Belarus after NATO’s saber-rattling whereas Russia hasn’t saber-rattled against the bloc in any way.

The blowback, however, could be that Germany gets jealous and begins to fear that its continental influence isbeing partly replacedby Poland due to the Anglo-American Axis’ favoritism towards it.The EU’s de facto leader already hosts US nukes and more of its partner’s military forces than any country in Europe so expanding the abovementioned program to Poland could make it wonder about their plans. In that event, it might not be as willing to obey their demands vis-à-vis Russia and soon China.

In order to not be misunderstood, Germany wouldn’t “defect” from NATO to theSino-RussoEntentein any way, it might only be more reluctant to sacrifice its objective national interests (mostly economic in this context) than if it felt comfortable with its perceived prestige over Poland. Germany would probably do their bidding anyhow at the end of the day, but it would be easier for them if it didn’t feel offended by Poland sharing in some of the perceived prestige of hosting nuclear weapons.

Considering the interests at play, while it can’t be ruled out that the Anglo-American Axis might agree to deploy nukes to Poland– whether around the time of NATO’s next summit in early July or sometime afterwards – there’s no reason to expect that it’ll happen anytime soon unless something changes.

If Russia achieves a military breakthrough across the front lines, irrespective of whether this prompts aconventional NATO intervention, thenthat could potentially serve as a tripwire for this scenario.

Section 702 authorizes warrantless surveillance of foreign citizens. When the FISA Act was passed, surveillance state boosters promised that 702 warrantless surveillances would never be used against American citizens. However, intelligence agencies have used a loophole in 702, allowing them to subject to warrantless surveillance any American who communicated with a non-US citizen who was a 702 target.

Despite the fearmongering by Mike Pompeo and others, as well as the opposition of both President Biden and Speaker Johnson, the amendment failed to pass by only one vote. The amendment would have passed had Speaker Johnson not cast a rare floor vote (speakers usually do not vote on legislation) against the amendment. -Ron Paul

Paul went further this week- calling Johnson out for being a complete sellout and acting, once again, against the interests of Americans.

""Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is reported to have bragged to his colleagues about how easily Speaker Johnson gave Democrats everything they wanted and asked for nothing in return,"" Paul noted, adding that Johnson ""reached across the aisle, stiffed the Republican majority that elected him speaker, and pushed through a massive gift to the warfare corporate welfare state."" in passing a massive aid package for Ukraine and Israel.

""After the House voted to send another $60 billion to notoriously corrupt Ukraine, members waved Ukrainian flags on the House floor and chanted, ‘Ukraine! Ukraine!’ While I find it distasteful and disgusting, in some ways, it seemed fitting.""

2024-04-25 05:45:00,Cashless Society: WEF Boasts That 98% Of Central Banks Are Adopting CBDCs,https://web.archive.org/web/20240425111739/https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/cashless-society-wef-boasts-98-central-banks-are-adopting-cbdcs#comment-stream,"Whatever happened to the WEF?  One minute they were everywhere in the media and now they have all but disappeared from public discourse.  After the pandemic agenda was defeated and the plan to exploit public fear to create a perpetual medical autocracy was exposed, Klaus Schwab and his merry band of globalists slithered back into the woodwork.  To be sure, we'll be seeing them again one day, but for now the WEF has relegated itself away from the spotlight and into the dark recesses of the Davos echo chamber.

Much of their discussions now focus on issues like climate change or DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion), but one vital subject continues to pop up in the white papers of global think tanks and it's a program that was introduced very publicly during covid.  Every person that cares about economic freedom should be wary of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as perhaps the biggest threat to human liberty since the attempted introduction of vaccine passports.

The WEF recently boastedin a new white paperthat 98% of all central banks are now pursuing CBDC programs.  The report, titled 'Modernizing Financial Markets With Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency', notes:

“CeBM is ideal for systemically important transactions despite the emergence of alternative payment instruments...Wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) is a form of CeBM that could unlock new economic models and integration points that are not possible today.”

The paper primarily focuses on the streamlining of crossborder transactions, an effort which the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has been deeply involved in for the past few years.  It also highlights an odd concept of differentiated CBDC mechanisms, each one specifically designed to be used by different institutions for different reasons.  Wholesale CBDCs would be used only by banking institutions, governments and some global corporations, as opposed to Retail CBDCs which would be reserved for the regular population.

How the value and buying power of Wholesale CBDCs would differ is not clear, but it's easy to guess that these devices would give banking institutions a greater ability homogenize international currencies and transactions.  In other words, it's the path to an eventual global currency model.  By extension, the adoption of CBDCs by governments and global banks will ultimately lead to what the WEF calls ""dematerialization"" - The removal of physical securities and money.  The WEF states:

""As with the Bank of England’s (BOE) RTGS modernization programme, the intention is to introduce a fully digitized securities system that is future-proofed for incremental adoption of DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology). The tokenization of assets involves creating digital tokens representing underlying assets like real estate, equities, digital art, intellectual property and even cash. Tokenization is a key use case for blockchain, with some estimates pointing towards $4-5 trillion in tokenized securities on DLTa  by 2030.""

Finally, they let the cat out of the bag:

""The BIS proposed two models for bringing tokenization into the monetary system: 1) Bring CBDCs, DTs and tokenized assets on to a common unified ledger, and 2) pursue incremental progress by creating interlinking systems.

They determined the latter option was more feasible given that the former requires a reimagination of financial systems. Experimentation with the unified ledger concept is ongoing.""

To interpret this into decoded language - The unified ledger is essentially another term for a one world digital currency system completely centralized and under the control of global banks like the BIS and IMF.  The WEF and BIS are acknowledging the difficulty of introducing such a system without opposition, so, they are recommending incremental introduction using ""interlinking systems"" (attaching CBDCs to paper currencies and physical contracts and then slowly but surely dematerializing those assets and making digital the new norm).  It's the totalitarian tip-toe.

The BIS predicts there will be at least 9 major CBDCs in circulation by the year 2030; this is likely an understatement of the intended plan.  Globalists have hinted in the past that they prefer total digitization by 2030.

A cashless society would be the end game for economic anonymity and freedom in trade.  Unless alternative physical currencies are widely adopted in protest, CBDCs would make all transactions traceable and easily interrupted by governments and banks.  Imagine a world in which all trade is monitored, all revenues are monitored and transactions can be blocked if they are found to offend the mandates of the system.  Yes, these things do happen today, but with physical cash they can be circumvented.

Imagine a world where your ability to spend money can be limited to certain retailers, certain services, certain products and chosen regions based on your politics, your social credit score and your background.  The control that comes with CBDCs is immense and allows for complete micromanagement of the population.  The fact that 98% of central banks are already adopting this technology should be one of the biggest news stories of the decade, yet, it goes almost completely ignored.

In the movieThe Perfect Storm, George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg are among the crew of a boat off the Northeast coast that is caught in the convergence of multiple powerful storms. The combination of tempests ultimately takes down the craft and its crew. We should all hope one of our nation’s most vital industries doesn’t succumb in similar fashion as it is caught in a perfect storm of ideological rigidity, bureaucratic arrogance, and regulatory overreach.

From fueling cars to heating homes to providing raw materials for much of the stuff that makes modern life possible,the oil and gas industry is indispensable to economic activity and comfortable living.Significant disruptions to the smooth functioning of the industry could have ripple effects throughout the entire economy, impacting businesses and consumers alike. At a time when inflation remains stubbornly high, the industry is a bright spot in the U.S. economy. Spurred on by technological development, abundant natural resources, and a dynamic market built upon the rule of law,America’s energy industry is undergoing a major renaissance. Despite political assaults grounded in the Biden administration’s hostility to fossil fuels, it remains the world’s largest supplier fuel supplier.But hasty and politically motivated FTC investigations, cheered on by allies in Congress, could erode progress and prosperity.

The FTC is currently blocking at least four mergers and acquisitions in the industry –between Chesapeake Energy and Southwest Energy, Chevron and Hess, Exxon and Pioneer Natural Resources, and Occidental and Crown Rock. The allegation is that mergers of these American companies would limit competition and hurt consumers. Count me unconvinced. The only unusual aspect of these deals is the lengths the FTC is willing to go to stop them. For an example of the unprecedented nature of this obstruction, Occidental (or “Oxy”) completed an acquisition valued at $57 billion less than four years ago gaining FTC approval about one month after it was announced. The FTC has now delayed Oxy’s deal with Crown Rock, which is less than one-fourth the size of the earlier acquisition, for more than six months. And there appears to be no light at the end of the tunnel.

These deals present the perfect opportunity for opposition based on the convergence of the storms of the Biden administration’s desire to accelerate a transition away from oil and gas,whether consumers want it or not, with the FTC’s efforts to entertain novel theories and to push the bounds of the law in order to amass even more power. As the Wall Street Journal recently revealed, “Some staff think failure in court may even be Ms. Khan’s goal. As one wrote: ‘I’m not sure being successful (or doing things well) is a shared goal, as the Chair wants to show that we can’t meet our mission mandate without legislative change.’” As the Journal’s editorial board opined, “This isn’t the role of the FTC, which is supposed to follow the law that Congress has already written.”

Blocking deals will send shockwaves throughout energy and capital markets and signal once and for all that America’s flirtation with energy independence is coming to an ignominious end.Most importantly, the decline of the oil and gas industry would be disastrous for the American people.The industry supports more than 10 million jobs in the United States.  The product: cheap, reliable, and local energy is critical to American manufacturing and to the high standard of living we all enjoy. Beyond America’s shores, the export of liquified natural gas is decoupling European and Asian countries from the grips of authoritarian Russia and China. A robust oil and gas industry makes America wealthier, safer, and promotes peace abroad.

Rather than fostering competition and protecting consumers, the FTC’s wonton use of authority stifles innovation, threatens American security, and undermines the vitality of a critical sector of our economy. Instead of focusing on unnecessary market interventions, policymakers should prioritize policies that promote innovation, encourage investment, and ensure a level playing field for all participants in the oil and gas industry. My organization, the Financial Fairness Alliance, is dedicated to informing the public on what their government is really doing.  Our goal is to uncover attempts from unelected bureaucrats to rig markets in favor of the politically connected.  In this vein, the FTC’s intervention in oil and gas mergers should be viewed with great scrutiny by the American public.FTC Chair Lina Khan promised to Republican senators to be a fair and an independent minded regulator.  We will soon find out if this was an empty promise.

Justin Bis is the Director of the Financial Fairness Alliance. He has held senior government roles, including at the White House and the U.S. Department of Energy, where he assisted with recruiting top-level governmental leaders responsible for regulating the U.S. financial and energy markets.

2024-04-25 12:06:47,Settling the Gold Versus Crypto Debate,https://web.archive.org/web/20240426145556/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-25/settling-gold-versus-crypto-debate,"by James Hickman via Schiff Sovereign

In 1972, while excavating to build a factory on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, a backhoe operator noticed gold objects glimmering in the bucket of his machine.

The construction worker had accidentally discovered the Varna Necropolis.

Dating back to around 4500 BC, the jewelry found in this ancient burial site is the earliest evidence of the use of gold by humans, and archeologists believe that they were considered a status symbol in ancient burial rituals.

Thousands of years ago, gold was likely collected from the earth’s surface in the form of nuggets or river dust.

It wasn’t until about 3500 BC, on a hilltop located in the modern-day country of Georgia, that a group of people from the prehistoric Kura-Araxes dug the oldest known gold mine.

Known as Sakdrisi-Kachagiani, the gold mine predates Ancient Egypt and even Mesopotamia.

By around 2000 BC, commercial transactions involving gold were being recorded on cuneiform tablets in modern-day Turkey. Materials like tin and textiles were traded for a particular weight of gold, because the first known gold coins weren’t minted until around the 6th Century BC.

King Croesus of Lydia in modern-day Turkey, used these coins to standardize the weight and purity of gold.

After that, gold coins were used directly in commerce for thousands of years, until the United Kingdom formally adopted the gold standard in the early 1800s. This was the first monetary system where a country’s paper money had a value directly linked to gold.

And even today, over 50 years since the US abandoned its own gold standard, central banks around the world still hold vast quantities of gold as a reserve to store value.

Individuals and large financial institutions do the same. And gold jewelry is still extremely valuable.

That’s quite a track record. For over 6,000 years, humans have valued gold.

Fifteen years ago, Bitcoin was created. And today there are countless millions of people who believe crypto has value too.

Now, gold and crypto are completely different and seldom belong in the same sentence. But for some reason there are often heated debates between proponents of each who argue bitterly over whether Gold or crypto is better.

No other asset classes attract such conflict or controversy. You don’t see passionate oil investors engaging in riotous debates with natural gas speculators. There is no heated argument over wheat vs. soybeans.

But gold and crypto are sometimes positioned as diametrically opposed, and this is just silly. Each asset has its function.

Gold has an enormous amount of value— and I have actuallyargued that it is still undervalued, even at its all-time high.

I’ve written extensively about the US government’s financial woes; the national debt is closing in on $35 trillion, and that figure is set to grow by $20+ trillion over the next decade according to the government’s own financial forecasts.

In addition to the new debt, the amount of debt the US government has to refinance over the next 5-7 years is staggering— literally tens of trillions of dollars. And all of it will be refinanced at a higher interest rate.

This means that interest payments on the national debt will keep growing like a malignant tumor.

In fact this year the amount of interest paid on the national debt will exceed defense spending for the first time in US history. And it will only keep rising.

Gold will most likely do very well in that scenario. But more importantly, foreign governments will likely move away from the US dollar as the global reserve currency over the next 5-10 years… and gold is the most likely asset to replace the dollar.

Central banks are already buying more gold as a reserve. And when the dollar loses its dominant global reserve status, countries are likely to turn to gold as a stable alternative that they can trust… because they already own it.

Simultaneously, crypto also has a lot of benefits. If you hold 100% of your savings in the financial system— whether at a bank, brokerage, etc., you might be surprised to find how easily it is to lose access to your funds.

Government agencies can seize your account (without due process) even by mistake. Banks can fail. They can freeze your account and force you to prove that you’re not doing anything wrong.

Plus even the most mundane bank transfers these days are heavily scrutinized. I had an exasperating conversation with a bank not long ago when I tried to send money to my sister… and they required all sorts of paperwork and justification to send my own money to my family.

Crypto is a great way to bypass that mess… to simply send money from point A to point B directly, without any middleman whatsoever.

Crypto exists digitally, so it can be moved across borders easily and at no cost. And if you know what you’re doing, you can hold it yourself, without any third party or even special security equipment… and this is an incredibly unique feature.

The idea behind a Plan B is to figure out what you want to accomplish and figure out which tools are available to help you achieve your goals.

Well, it’s a pretty smart goal to want to have protection against the declining currency of the world’s most heavily indebted nation. It’s also a reasonable goal to want to some assets that are completely beyond the financial system.

Crypto and gold are two completely separate tools for completely separate purposes. There’s no sense in debating crypto vs. gold. To me the answer is both.

‘TheNIHwithholds the entirety of therecordsas theyare protected from release,’ Gorka Garcia-Malene, an NIH officer, told The Epoch Times in a letter.

She citedan exemptionoutlined in the act thatallows government agencies to partially or fully withhold information.

‘In this case, exemption 3 incorporates 35 U.S.C. 209 (f), which reads in relevant part, ‘No Federal agency shall grant any license under a patent or patent application on a federally owned invention unless the person requesting the license has supplied the agency with a plan for development or marketing of the invention, except that any such plan shall be treated by the Federal agency as commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged and confidential and not subject to disclosure under section 552 of title 5,’’ Ms. Garcia-Malene wrote.

‘Exemption 4 protects from disclosure trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is privileged and confidential,’ she added.”

What is left to say? It’s been three years and a billion tears, to paraphrase Social Distortion, the $400 million Moderna kickback has been public knowledge for over a year, and no amount of screaming into the ether nor bureaucratic hoop-jumping apparently has any effect whatsoever on the political leadership class in our so-called democracy.

“Tens of thousands of people rallied over the weekend in a central Tokyo park to protest the World Health Organization’s (WHO) proposed pandemic treatyand amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) — proposals that critics allege threaten Japan’s and other countries’ national sovereignty…

The rally called for Japan’s withdrawal from the WHO. Participants also opposed the ‘pandemic treaty’ and IHR amendments and the Japanese government’s public health policies, Hayashi and Inoue, who both spoke at the rally, told The Defender.

The rally was organized at the East Ikebukuro Central Park. Izumi Kamijo, a member of WCH Japan, told The Defender the site was symbolic as it once housed the Sugamo Prison, ‘where most of the top government and military people after World War II were detained who refused to collaborate with the occupying force, i.e., General McArthur and the U.S. military.’

Estimates of the turnout are as high as 100,000 people, but according to Kamijo, ‘The turnout is estimated around 20,000 … Some people say up to 30,000, others say well over 10,000. So, 20,000 would be appropriate.’”

2024-04-26 05:45:00,Russia To Seize $440 Million From JPMorgan,https://web.archive.org/web/20240426145556/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/russia-seize-440-million-jpmorgan,"Seizing assets?Two can play at that game...

Just days afterWashington voted to authorize the REPO Act- paving the way for the Biden administration confiscate billions in Russian sovereign assets which sit in US banks - it appears Moscow has a plan of its own (let's call it the REVERSE REPO Act) as aRussian court has ordered the seizure of $440 million from JPMorgan.

The seizure order follows fromKremlin-run lender VTB launching legal action against the largest US bank to recoup money stuck under Washington’s sanctions regime.

As The FT reports,the order, published in the Russian court register on Wednesday, targets funds in JPMorgan’s accounts and shares in its Russian subsidiaries, according to the ruling issued by the arbitration court in St Petersburg.

The assets had beenfrozen by authorities in the wake of the western sanctions, andhighlights some of the fallout western companies are feelingfrom the punitive measures against Moscow.

Specifically,The FT notesthat the dispute centers on $439mn in funds that VTB held in a JPMorgan account in the US.

When Washington imposed sanctions on the Kremlin-run bank, JPMorgan had to move the funds to a separate escrow account. Under the US sanctions regime, neither VTB nor JPMorgan can access the funds.

In response, VTB last week filed a lawsuit against the New York-based group to get Russian authorities to freeze the equivalent amount in Russia, warning that JPMorgan was seeking to leave Russia and would refuse to pay any compensation.

The following day, JPMorgan filed its own lawsuit against the Russian lender in a US court to prevent a seizure of its assets, arguing that it had no way to reclaim VTB’s stranded US funds to compensate its own potential losses from the Russian lawsuit.

Yesterday's decision sided with VTB, ordering the seizure of funds in JPMorgan’s Russian accounts and “movable and immovable property,” including its stake of a Russian subsidiary.

JPMorgan said it faced ""certain and irreparable harm""from VTB’s efforts, exposed to a nearly half-billion-dollar loss, for merely abiding by U.S. sanctions.

The order was the latest example of American banks getting caught between the demands of Western sanctions regimes and overseas interests. Last summer, a Russian court froze about $36mn worth of assets owned by Goldman following a lawsuit by state-owned bank Otkritie. A few months later the court ruled that the Wall Street investment bank had to pay the funds to Otkritie.

The tit-for-tat continues.

Shares are higher by more than 5% in the cash session on Thursday. However, this note will not expand on earnings. Instead, we will focus on a letter from the company to employees stating: Stop eating chicken during lunch and dinner meals because soaring demand has collided with dwindling poultry supply—and the need to preserve supply urgently.

Bloombergobtained the letter Chief Restaurant Officer Scott Boatwright sent employees last week. He told them:

""Due to its sustained strong sales we need your help to keep up with our guests' demand for this popular protein option.""

Boatwright told store managers and hot-side and cold-side kitchen employees not to order chicken or chicken al pastor with their free or discounted employee meals. Even white-collar Chipotle workers were told not to order chicken.

The message read,""Let's Conserve Our Fan-Favorite Chicken.""Execs did not give a timeline for boosting the chicken supply. The letter aimed to""preserve our supply of Adobo Chicken for our guests.""

Chief Corporate Affairs and Food Safety Officer Laurie Schalow told Bloomberg in an emailed statement:

""Due to the high demand for chicken in our restaurants and sustained success of our limited-time offer chicken al pastor, we temporarily asked all of our employees at corporate and in-restaurants to select another protein option for their meals to preserve our supply.""

The Chipotle mobile app shows no disruptions to any protein option on the menu.

Harper McNamara, an employee in Michigan at the only unionized Chipotle US store, was quoted by Bloomberg as saying the company's move was a slap in the face to its workforce: ""It's disrespectful, just on a personal level.""

2024-04-26 06:01:00,Sceptical Supreme Court Could Hand Trump Partial Victory In Immunity Case,https://web.archive.org/web/20240426145556/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/listen-live-supreme-court-hears-trumps-presidential-immunity-appeal,"After two and a half hours, the Supreme Court has finished hearing arguments on whether a former president is immune from criminal prosecution.

Reading the tea-leaves of the comments has left most believing that SCOTUS will fail to grant former President Trump the full immunity he is seeking (choosing instead to narrow the protections for former presidents), but are likely to issue a ruling that could further delay his trial on charges of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.

That would be a partial win for the former President.

As Axios reports,a definitive ruling against Trump- a clear rejection of his theory of immunity that would allow his Jan. 6 trial to promptly resume -seemed to be the least likely outcome.

Amajority of the justices seemed inclined to rule that former presidents must have at least some protection from criminal charges,but not necessarily the ""absolute immunity"" Trump is seeking.

The core distinction during oral arguments came down to a president's official vs. unofficial actions. — and which of Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results were official vs. unofficial.

The most likely outcome might be for the high court to punt,perhaps kicking the case back to lower courts for more nuanced hearings.

That would still be a victory for Trump,asSam Dorman reports via The Epoch Timesthat the outcome ofthis appeal could delay lower court proceedings in President Trump’s Washington trial as well as his cases in Georgia and Florida. It’s unlikely that the Supreme Court, which is expected to release a decision in June, will write an opinion that delays his ongoing criminal “hush money” trial in New York.

The bottom-line is that no clear, concise majority opinion emerged this morning.

But there may be five justices willing to kick the can down the road - and that's enough for Trump, at least for now.

The Supreme Court will hear oral argument today over former President Donald Trump’s claim that he’s immune from criminal prosecution for official acts he undertook while in office.

Listen live here (due to start at 1000ET):

LISTEN LIVE: Supreme Court hears case on whether Trump has presidential immunity from prosecutionhttps://t.co/zGSnfhqCJq

Jonathan Turley is live-blogging the hearing on X:

We are off and running on the oral arguments on immunity with John Sauer, former Scalia clerk, arguing for the former president.

...Chief JusticeRobertsasked the most poignant question.What if a president appointed an ambassador (a clearly official act) but does so for a bribe?Sauer offered a nuanced point that the bribe itself would not be an official act...

...JusticeSotomayor just hit Sauer and said that Trump was only acting for personal gainand not in the interests or in a function of his government. She is making the slippery slope argument that such immunity would protect the assassination of a president...

...JusticeJacksonsaid that""every president from the beginning of time"" understood that they could be prosecutedbut they ""have continued to function and do their job.""...

...Saueragrees that a president can be prosecuted for private conduct. His point is only thatthe motivations of official conduct should not be the inquiry of the court.He is doing a good job in maintaining a more nuanced position before the Court...

Justice Jackson gets embarrassed by Trump lawyer John Sauer when she tries to describe America where the president has immunity:“The regime you've described is the one we've operated under for over 234 years.”pic.twitter.com/yo15zSUkhA

...JusticeAlito is asking whether the ""robust form of immunity"" that he is presenting is really necessary.Alito is exploring the middle ground that some of us have previously discussed...

...Sauer responded again about the danger of allowing motivations to be pursued.Alito suggests that they may insist on objective, not subjective, grounds in making the key determination -- on ""purely objective grounds"" to determine if this is an official function or issue...

...Interestingly,Alito seems to have answered Sotomayoron a hypothetical in dealing with the term ""plausible"" . . . an early preview of the conference!

HAHAHA: Justice Alito Exposes Flaws in D.C. Court Opinion Being Used Against Trump After Special Counsel Attorney Claimed Grand Juries Are Layers Of Protection, Says That May Not Be True Since Even Ham Sandwiches Aren't Safe from Grand Jury Indictments! LISTENpic.twitter.com/ueYZXcdN0r

... JusticeThomas just asked Sauer if he is challenging the constitutionalityof the Special Counsel. Sauer said that they have not come so in this case.

...Sotomayor just referred to the alternative electors as ""fake""and Sauer pushed back on the language of the indictment on the record for decision...

Trump Lawyer NUKES Sotomayor's ""Fraudulent Electors"" Talking Point at SCOTUS""Apply it to the allegations here. What is plausible about the president assisting in creating a fraudulent slate of electoral candidates, assuming you accept the facts of the complaint on their face,…pic.twitter.com/0J0A8KzenM

Michael Dreeben is now up for Special Counsel...

...Roberts just slammed the lower court""a former president can be prosecuted for his official acts because the fact of the prosecution means that the former president has acted in defiance of the laws.""...

...He said that he is ""concerned"" because itsounds like ""a former president can be prosecuted because he is being prosecuted.""...

...Roberts just laid low the appellate decision and Dreeben struggled in defense of it.Roberts responded that, if the Special Counsel does not subscribe to the sweeping decision, why shouldn't the court send it back?

...Roberts said that the D.C. Circuit failed to do a ""focused"" analysis on these act by adopting a ""tautological"" standard...

...Gorsuch returned to whether Dreeben is suggesting that immunity questions turn on motivations.Dreeben insists that it is the objection of the conduct rather than the motives...

...Dreeben just conceded that he is not sure if motivations would be relevant in determining immunityin relation in core powers...

...Gorsuch noted however that all presidents use their powers in part out of a desire to get reelected. Dreeben insisted that this all just falls under a different category.Gorsuch is clearly frustrated the lack of clarity if motive are relevant...

...Dreeben just dealt with the drone strikes and said Obama fell in an exception from the murder statute.

...Barrett noted that that sounds a lot like a public versus private distinction...

...This ""public authority defense""sounds a lot like arguing a question of motives, again,as raised by the other justices. Dreeben could only say that it was based on ""objective"" facts.

...Justice Barrett just asked if any immunity would also bar state prosecutions.She suggested that immunity may also protect a president from standing for trial on the state or local levels...

As The Epoch Times' Sam Dorman reports,besides altering longstanding precedent, the decision could bear heavily on, and delay the criminal prosecutions President Trump is facing before the election.

An appeals court in Washington rejected his attempt to claim immunity in the Justice Department’s prosecution of his activity on Jan. 6 and in response to the 2020 presidential election.

The Supreme Court is set to review that decision and potentially establish a broader definition of presidential immunity.

The Supreme Court here has three main options:

to uphold the appeal court’s rejection of President Trump’s immunity claims,

to accept his claims,

or remand the matter back to U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan with a refined test on what presidential acts are immune from prosecution.

Nixon v. Fitzgerald, a Supreme Court case from 1973, established that presidents enjoy absolute immunity from civil liability for actions that fell within the “outer perimeter” of their official duties.

Experts speculated to The Epoch Times that the justices could extend that same framework to criminal liability.

This is the second major oral argument the justices are hearing about attempts to punish President Trump for his conduct following the 2020 presidential election.

They heard oral argument in February over Colorado’s attempt to disqualify him from the state’s ballot, and issued a unanimous judgment in opposition."
2024-04-26 06:30:00,Polish President Admits That Major Infrastructure Project Has Dual Military Purposes,https://web.archive.org/web/20240426145556/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/polish-president-admits-major-infrastructure-project-has-dual-military-purposes#comment-stream,"Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

Polish President Andrzej Duda revealed in an interview that the Central Communication Port (CPK by its Polish abbreviation) transportation megaproject outside of Warsaw has dual military purposes.

He represents Poland’s prior conservative-nationalist government but remains in office despite the liberal-globalist opposition’s victory at the polls last fall since his term doesn’t expire till next year.

Duda’s latest claim makes Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s decision topause and auditthe CPK even more scandalous.

It was analyzedhereat the time that he was economically subordinating Poland to Germany after having already done so on the political and military fronts, whichlent credence to conservative-nationalist chieftain Jaroslaw Kaczynski’s warning late last year that Tusk is actually a “German agent”.Tusk then subordinated his country to its neighbor on theeducational, judicial, and diplomatic fronts, all of which is being done on the pretext of implementing various “reforms”.

The end result is thatPoland now plays an indispensable role in Germany’s “Fortress Europe”that was elaborated uponhere, but Duda’s unexpected revelation about the CPK’s dual military purpose might reverse some of the tempo by putting grassroots and external pressure on Tusk to approve the CPK. Most Poles are in favor of this transport megaproject according to the latest polls that Duda’s interlocutor cited, while the US has an interest in using Poland as an anti-Russian military launchpad.

Here's exactly what Duda saidaccording to Google Translate:

“It is no secret to anyone, and I emphasize this: If a situation of potential danger for Poland were to occur, and the relocation of additional allied forces to Poland would be necessary to defend our territory, we do not currently have an airport that would be able to provide such support for the West to quickly come to Poland.”

This reminder is meant to imply that Tusk is harming NATO’s contingency plans for partisan reasons.

It’s also a dog whistle harkening back to what the former conservative-nationalist government’s Defense Minister claimed about his liberal-globalist predecessors regarding Tusk’s defensive plans during his prior two terms in office. Mariusz Blaszczak alleged that Tusk’s governmentplanned to withdraw west of the Vistula Riverin the political fantasy that Russia invaded Poland until NATO reinforcements arrived and claimed to have the classified documents to prove it too.

Tusk’s previous time in power was marked by the arguably German-advised Russian-Polish rapprochement that was meant to create a “Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok” during the halcyon era of Russian-EU relations. Those hopes were obviously dashed as everyone now knows, after which Tusk’s conservative-nationalist successors never wasted an opportunity to speculate that his pragmatic policy at the time was due to secret Russian influence over his government.

Blaszczak’s allegation should be seen in that light just like Duda’s reminder should too. Their conservative-nationalist movement sought to exploitpolitical Russophobia in Polish societyahead of the elections to remain in power, but even though that didn’t work, they haven’t learned their lesson and are now trying to employ it yet again in their attempt to return to power one day. That said, it’s indeed important for Poles to be aware of both facts, after which they can make up their own mind.

Revealing allegedly classified details about outdated Polish national defense policy is one thing, while raising awareness of how possibly canceling the country’s largest megaproject in recent memory could impact national security in theoretical contingencies (not to mention killing lots of jobs) is another.

The first disclosure didn’t succeed in reshaping popular perceptions of the liberal-globalists whereas the second stands a greater chance of success of doing so even though it’s too early to conclude that it will.

Another point to pay attention to is that this isn’t the first time that Duda dropped a bombshell about a significant issue.Earlier in April, he told Lithuanian media thatforeign companies own most of Ukraine’s industrial agriculture, thus confirming what had previously been reported but denied by the West. He therefore has a habit of being very candid about issues that he sincerely believes are of immense importance for Poland’s objective national interests.

Regardless of whatever the reader’s opinion might be about the likelihood of Duda’s scenario unfolding, which concerns Poland relying on the CPK to serve as the port of entry for a large-scale NATO intervention in the event of a Russian invasion, his point about that megaproject is militarily and strategically sound. It’ll be very difficult for Tusk to argue against it after he himself jumped on the Russia-bashing bandwagon since returning to power and continues fearmongering about its intentions.

He even jumped the shark last month by sensationally claiming that “we are in a pre-war era” that he compared to the run-up to World War II, thus suggesting whether sincerely or not that he supposedly believes that it’s possible for Russia to invade Poland in the coming future.If he ultimately decides to cancel the CPK despite Duda reminding him of its dual military purposes, then he’d discredit his previous fearmongering about Russia, which is thepretext for justifyingPoland’s subordination to Germany.

Tusk’s hands might be tied, however, since the combination of grassroots and external (US/NATO) pressure might be enough to get him to reconsider weaponizing the CPK as part of his partisan war against his conservative-nationalist opponents under whom this megaproject was initiated.In any case, Duda inadvertently vindicated those Russian observers who long suspected that the CPK had dual military purposes, thus proving that they were right about Poland’s real plans all along.

2024-04-26 06:55:00,UK Defense Chief Says Ukraine To Increase Long-Range Strikes In Russia,https://web.archive.org/web/20240426145556/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/uk-sends-record-aid-package-defense-chief-says-ukraine-increase-long-range-strikes,"Just as President Biden was signing into effect the newly approved foreign defense package which includes $60 billion for Ukraine, the United Kingdom also rolled out its own massive aid package (though paling in comparison), first unveiled Tuesday.

Britain announced its single largest aid package for Ukraine yet, at the equivalent of$620 million(£500 million). According to UKNATO officials, the arms include Storm Shadow missilesamonga total of 1,600 strike and air defense missiles, four million rounds of ammo, 60 boats, and over 400 vehicles.

Even though the White House isbusy cautioningthat in the coming monthsRussia is likely to make more gains on the front lines, according to fresh words of Jake Sullivan, British leadership is still talking about ""winning"".

Defense Minister Grant Shapps, for example, hadthis to sayabout new aid: ""This record package of military aid will give President Zelensky and his brave nation more of the kit they needto kick Putin out and restore peace and stability in Europe.""

""The UK was the first to provide NLAW missiles, the first to give modern tanks, and the first to send long-range missiles,"" he added. ""Now, we are going even further. We will never let the world forget the existential battle Ukraine is fighting, and with our enduring support,they will win.""

Britain's military leadership is also echoing this optimism, with UK defense chief, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, tellingFinancial Timesthat the West's new infusion of military aid will help Ukraine increase its long-range strikes onRussian territory:

Ukraine isset to increase long-range attacks inside Russiaas an influx of western military aid aims to help Kyiv shape the war “in much stronger ways”, the head of the UK military has said.

Admiral Sir Tony Radakin acknowledged the downbeat mood surrounding Ukraine’s defence in an interview with the Financial Times, admitting the country was facing a “difficult” fight to repel advancing Russian forces.

But Britain’s chief of defence, a key figure in the west’s military support for Kyiv, stressed that such a gloomy “snapshot” of the war failed to recognise longer trends more in Kyiv’s favour.

Adm. Radakin continued, ""As Ukraine gains more capabilities for the long-range fight . . . its ability to continue deep operations will [increasingly]become a feature"" of the war. He emphasized of new weapons systems, ""they definitely have an effect.""

UK leadership has of late put the country's defense industry on a ""war footing"" in preparation to support Kiev for the long haul. More of Radakin's words point to escalation (and not negotiations) in the following...""Don’t expect anyone to say publicly ‘this is the plan’ and A, B and C are now going to happen,"" he told FT. Some aspect of Ukraine's strategy and operations ""will be hidden . . . some will be dictated by a tactical or operational advantage, and some also depends on more foundational aspects,"" he added.

Nowhere in the UK defense chief's interview was acknowledgement that these policies could lead to runaway escalation, and an eventual direct confrontation between nuclear-armed powers. The Kremlin has in response vowed that it willtake more territoryin Ukraine in orderto counteract the longer range of NATO missiles.

Abysmal economic data released on Thursday painted a not-so-rosy picture for the US economy. In the last 3 post-pandemic years, nominal growth has been positive while quality of life has deteriorated behind the scenes of officially released data, and the latest data continues the trend.

GDP growth slowed from 3.4% to 1.6%—missing economist expectations by 90 basis points (0.9%). Not bad enough? Core PCE inflation has also accelerated (on a quarterly basis) from 2% to 3.7%. I wouldn't weigh these numbers as gospel, since they are not yearly figures, but the fact remains that nominal growth is sputtering and consumer prices, the most sticky ones, are red hot:

GDP came in 3 standard deviations below the mean estimate, and core PCE came in 2 standard deviations above the mean estimate. Though we're not there yet, since the unemployment rate hasn't spiked yet, the makings of stagflation are shaping up during an election year. No wonder gold has been surging lately. It is up $150 per ounce over the last 30 days as people look to insulate themselves.

One note: this is the advance print for Q1 GDP, and will have more revisions before the final release in a few weeks. It could be revised higher:

GDP growth shrinks in the lead-up to recessions, before flipping negative and making the contraction official. Look at the chart below in the late '90s. We're currently in one of these deceleration phases. This is the lowest print in 2 years:

The core PCE print is more disconcerting since it has dislocated from growth. Prices are supposed to ebb and flow with economic growth, as measured by GDP, in our credit-based world economy.

Price growth is moving in the opposite direction of GDP growth, a killer combination. People aren't quite thrown out of work en masse, but living expenses are rising faster than people can stomach.

The correlation between Core PCE and headline consumer price inflation is clear, and CPI could be headed back above 4% sooner and faster than many believe:

For voters in an election year, this is poison for the incumbent. The last time that the US had true stagflation was during the Jimmy Carter presidency.

Again, the US has not entered true stagflation just yet. The unemployment rate is still fully intact, albeit a little bit elevated, and this is only one data release, not a consistent trend.

This is what the electoral map looked like during Jimmy Carter's re-election bid:

Markets are pricing inhotinflation expectations andhighFed interest rate expectations. The 2-year US Treasury yield, a Fed Funds proxy, and 10s, a growth/inflation proxy, both spiked 8 basis points moments after the data. This only adds to the months-long trend of 2s and 10s both etching higher as the Fed holds interest rates firm but economic activity is still stubbornly elevated:

Another view is this chart of Fed rate expectations for different months. The expectation in January was for the Fed to make 3+ rate cuts by June, that expectation has shrunk to zero cuts. For December, 6+ expected cuts have shrunk to just one and will become zero if data releases continue showcasing positive nominal GDP, however weak it may be, and hot price inflation:

Ultimately, just don't worry about it. We know how every cycle resolves: financial markets reach their breaking point, corporates begin layoffs, equities crater, and the Fed slashes its policy rates. Now that the Fed faces the problem of a US Treasury burdened by $1.5 trillion in annual interest expense by year-end, the certainty of this cycle resolving in cuts is even more crystallized.

If you're on a multi-decade time horizon, as you should be, this is simply the late stage of another economic cycle. One of many that you'll experience in the years to come. Data releases like this one should not matter to you unless you're an algorithmic trader. Chill out, zoom out. Bitcoin has been rangebound for 8 weeks:

2024-04-26 07:20:00,"""Our Enemy, The Fed""",https://web.archive.org/web/20240426145556/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/our-enemy-fed#comment-stream,"Authored by George Ford Smith via The Mises Institute,

The first thing to know about Dr. Thomas E. Woods, Jr.’s’ bookOur Enemy, the Fedis he’s giving it away. Click the link, get your copy and read the whole book. Clearly, such intellectual charity is not only rare but in the educational spirit of Mises.org. The subject matter is light-heavy but Woods, author of the bestsellerMeltdown(reviewedhere), navigates it with the smooth skill of a master, making the reader experience satisfying from beginning to end.

The title reflects another insight, paralleling as it does Albert Jay Nock’sOur Enemy, the State.Most of us were raised to believe government and its agencies serve our best interests. As libertarian scholarship has shown the truth is the exact opposite,particularly with government’s sleazy relationship with money and banking.

Admittedly, it’s a hard idea to accept since it involves a pernicious breach of trust, but Woods makes it abundantly clear. To our overlords we are easily-duped chattel.

Until Ron Paul decided to run for president and hisEnd the Fedcame along in 2009, the general public was mostly blind to the Fed’s existence.Austrians aside, the few who knew something about it — mostly university-trained economistson the take from the Fed— considered it a vital part of an advanced industrial economy. Yet the Fed had been around for 96 years when Dr. Paul’s book emerged. Given that it’s in charge of the money we use how did it remain in the shadows for tax-burdened citizens for nearly a century? What’s up with that?

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis tells us the Fed’scongressional assignmentis “to promotemaximum employmentandprice stability.” (Bold in original) For these it talks about interest rates, and its aim is to increase the money supply so that prices rise gently at or around a 2 percent rate.

How gentle is a two percent rate? After 10 years of two percent monetary inflation, it would take$121.90 to buy what $100bought in year one.But that’s over a decade, and you might not notice it unless you’re one of the hungry poor not on welfare. The Fed’s inflation of the money supply has been ongoing since it began operations in 1914, draining 96 percent of the dollar’s purchasing power.

On what planet is a 96 percent devaluation considered stability?Its real purpose is to inflate then assure us it makes good sense. Never mind the boom - bust cycle it creates along with the debauchery of our currency. We’re being gaslighted. Where did all the newly-created money go?

Dr. Paul, who had a long career in Congress whose confrontations with Fed Chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke have become legendary in libertarian circles,tells us:

Law permits this highly secretive, private bank to create credit at will and distribute it as it sees fit.

The chairman of the Federal Reserve can blatantly inject in a public hearing thathe has no intention of revealing where the newly created credit goes and who benefits.When asked, he essentially answered, “It’s none of your business,” saying that it would be “counterproductive” to do so. [My italics]

The picture I get is of people in a hideout somewhere — in this case, the FOMC meeting in the Eccles building in Washington, D.C. — cranking out money then injecting it into the economy in some mysterious manner, while telling us in Keynesian doublespeak their operations keep us safe and prosperous.

Is it really hard to fathom that those in charge might be up to no good?

After defining the Federal Reserve System — the Fed — as the American central bank enjoying“a government-granted monopoly on the creation of legal-tender money,”Woods proceeds to evaluate the Fed from a broad or macro perspective.

What exactly did the Fed fix?Christina Romer who served under Obama as Chair of his Council of Economic Advisors found that “recessions were in fact not more frequent in the pre-Fed than the post-Fed period.” Even comparing the periods of 1796-1915 to post-WW II — thus omitting the Great Depression of 1930-1945 — “economist Joseph Davis finds no appreciable difference between the length and duration of recessions as compared to the period of the Fed.”

Woods takes us back through American history to see how banking and credit developed. Government, which has no money of its own, befriends ones that have it. During the period between the expiration of the first Bank of the US and the creation of the Second Bank of the US — 1811-1817 — the government granted banks the privilege of expanding credit unsecured by deposits while allowing them to tell depositors attempting to withdraw their money to “come back in a couple of years.” While banks could be charged with legal counterfeiting and embezzlement, Woods does not use the terms. In fact, nowhere in the book does he use the words “counterfeit” or “embezzle.”

When the Second Bank of the US started inflating in 1817 it created the Panic of 1819.He writes:

The lesson of that sorry episode — namely, that the economy gets taken on a wild and unhealthy ride when the money supply is dramatically and artificially increased and then suddenly reduced — was so obvious that even the political class managed to figure it out.

Many inflationists before the panic became hard-money believers after.Condy Raguet and Daniel Raymond, a disciple of Alexander Hamilton, became hard-money advocates and wrote books on economics. John Quincy Adams cited the hard-money Bank of Amsterdam “as a a model to emulate.”

But the inflationists persisted and pushed for more government intervention, and Unit banking in particular:

In the nineteenth century, nearly all American states instituted a regulation known as unit banking, which limited all banks to a single office. No branch banking was allowed, whether intrastate or interstate. The obvious result was a very fragile and undiversified banking system in which banks could be brought to ruin if local conditions turned sour.

Fractional-reserve banking is a major cause of bank panics.But the US went further. Other countries did not “cripple their banking systems” with unit banking laws. Canada, in particular, had no unit banking laws and no banking panics. The Bank of Canada did not emerge until 1934:

As Milton Friedman was fond of pointing out, although the Great Depression claimed over 9,000 American banks, the number of banks that failed in Canada at that time was zero. American bank panics, it turns out, were in large part the result of government intervention — in the form of unit banking — in the first place.

Yet it was the market and the imposed pseudo-gold standard that took the blame, and Americans got Hoover’s meddling then FDR’s New Deal.

Later in the book Woods mentions the hands-off approach to the depression of 1920-1921, “which saw unemployment shoot up to 12.4 percent and production decline by 17 percent. Wholesale prices fell by 56 percent.” And the Fed kept its printing press quiet. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research the depression was over by the summer of 1921.

One of the strongest parts of Woods’ book is his treatment of deflation — falling prices. It is only in the inflationary world of larcenous economics that falling prices are the“It” to be avoided.

A few of the points he makes:

Increasing the money supply to support increased production is a fallacy. “Any supply of money can facilitate any number of transactions.”

The money supply under a hard money system grows “relatively slowly, and the supply of other goods and services increases more rapidly. With these goods and services more abundant with respect to money, their prices fall.”

The claim that people would stop buying things if they knew prices would fall ignores the fact that people “value goods in the present more highly than they do the same goods in the future. This factor offsets the desire to wait indefinitely for a lower price.”

If deflation is anticipated entrepreneurs and the firms they deal with would adjust their bids accordingly.

With the increase in money’s purchasing power people could save simply by hoarding.

Who’s hurt the most by deflation? The power centers in society — government and Wall Street. We hear hysteria over deflation because it hurts the establishment the most, “and only the mildest concern about inflation, which hurts everyone else.”

Tom Woods has published another gem and is giving it away.The war we’re fighting now depends for its outcome on sound information and, as always, personal integrity. Never forget, the Fed must go.His book provides much of the intellectual ammunition needed to neutralize the enemy and avoid repeating the mistakes that brought us this mess in the first place.

2024-04-26 08:18:31,"Futures Jump As Tech Giants Soar, Yen Plummets After BOJ Refuses To Prop Up Crashing Currency",https://web.archive.org/web/20240426145556/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/futures-jump-tech-giants-soar-yen-plummets-after-boj-refuses-prop-crashing-currency#comment-stream,"In a rollercoaster 48 hours to close the week, yesterday's early market slump (after the disappointing Meta guidance) has been fully reversed and stock futures are now pointing sharply higher after blockbuster earnings from Microsoft and Alphabet with attention now turning to the release of US personal consumption data - the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, where a hotter-than-expected reading after Thursday’s weaker GDP figures may signal US rates will remain higher for longer. As of 7:40am, S&P futures are 0.7% higher while Nasdaq futures gain 1.1%. The positive sentiment carried into European trading, with tech stocks leading equity gains, with miners outperforming as copper hit $10,000 a ton for the first time in two years. Traders are also speculating as to whether Japan will intervene to support the Yen after the currency slid to a 34-year low before rebounding after the central bank kept rates on hold and Ueda said nothing to prop up the currency in what Deutsche Bank has called a policy of ""benign neglect."" Later in the day, attention will shift. Elsewhere, the USD is higher and bond yields are slightly lower. In commodities, oil and precious metals are higher; base metals and Ags are mixed. Today, key focus will be the March PCE release at 8.30am ET, where consensus expects headline PCE and core PCE to both rise +0.3% MoM.

In premarket trading, Google parent Alphabet surged as much as 12%, poised to add more than $230 billion to its market capitalization and exceed $2 trillion in valuation. Microsoft rose 4% after the software giant reported third-quarter results that beat expectations, a sign that AI is fueling growth and demand. The companies trounced Wall Street estimates with their latest quarterly results, fueled in part by demand for AI services.  In other earnings-related moves, Exxon fell 1.2% after missing EPS but smashing revenue estimates, while Intel slumped more than 7% after providing weaker-than-anticipated guidance. Here are some other notable movers:

While earnings remain center stage, the focus Friday will also be on US data, with the Fed's preferred measure of inflation of particular interest. Treasury yields dipped following yesterday’s bond-market losses when stagflationary GDP data pushed back expectations for policy easing. A gauge of the dollar was steady.

“We have a precarious situation where the earnings of a few big companies are driving sentiment on the entire market,”said Justin Onuekwusi, chief investment officer St James Place Management. “We have seen a bit of volatility driven by earnings as well as rate decreases being priced out and that’s likely to continue.”

Almost 80% of S&P 500 firms that have reported so far have beaten analysts’ earnings estimates, according to JPMorgan strategists. Still, stock price reactions have been underwhelming, with better-than-expected results seeing below average upside, while those missing estimates are being penalized by more than usual, the strategists wrote. More than 50% of S&P 500 companies have yet to report.

A big highliight of the overnight session was the latest collapse in the Japanese yen which fell to a fresh cycle low near 157 versus the dollar after the Bank of Japan stood pat on interest rates and Governor Ueda did little to push back against recent weakness in the press conference. The yen’s slump to a record low versus the dollar has left traders on guard for any hints of intervention from Japan. The yen swung sharply from the day’s low to near its high amid jittery trading in the wake of the Bank of Japan’s decision to keep monetary policy unchanged.

“Should the yen fall further from here, like after the BOJ decision in September 2022, the possibility of intervention will increase,” said Hirofumi Suzuki, chief currency strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “It is not the level but it’s the speed that will trigger the action.”

European stocks rose along with US equity futures: the Stoxx 600 is up 0.6%, with technology and construction sectors leading gains, while chemicals and insurance subgroups are the biggest losers. Thyssenkrupp shares jumped after Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky’s EP Corporate Group agreed to buy a fifth of the German manufacturer’s troubled steel unit. Miners outperformed as copper hit $10,000 a ton for the first time in two years. Here are the biggest movers Friday:

Earlier in the session, Asian stocks rose, headed for their best week since November, as investors cheered upbeat earnings from technology firms and sentiment on China continued to improve. Japanese stocks rose as the Bank of Japan left interest rates unchanged. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.8%, with TSMC and Tencent among the biggest boosts. The gauge extended its weekly gains to more than 3%. Stocks rose in mainland China and Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index poised for its best week since April 2015. Signs of an improving Chinese economy, better corporate earnings and Bejing’s support measures have spurred inflows from global funds.

In FX, the dollar was slightly lower, as all the action was in the Japanese yen which cratered to a fresh 34 year low near 157 versus the dollar after the Bank of Japan stood pat on interest rates and Governor Ueda did little to push back against recent weakness in the press conference. USD/JPY did swing sharply lower to sub-155 before swiftly rebounding in jittery trading amid heightened speculation that authorities may intervene in the market.

In rates, treasuries climbed, paring some of Thursday’s post-data drop. US yields are richer by up to 2bp across long-end of the curve with 5s30s spread around 8bp, tighter by around 1bp on the day;10-year yields around 4.685%, down 1.5bp on the day with bunds outperforming by 1bp in the sector.

In commodities, oil prices advance, with WTI rising 0.4% to trade near $83.90 a barrel. Spot gold rises 0.7% to around $2,350/oz. Copper hit $10,000 a ton for the first time in two years.

Looking at today's calendar, the US session highlight is the March personal income/spending (8:30am); we algo get the April revised University of Michigan sentiment (10am) and April Kansas City Fed services activity (11am). Fed members are in self-imposed quiet period ahead of May 1 policy announcement

A recap of overnight news courtesy of Newsquawk

APAC stocks were mostly higher as the region digested recent market themes including disappointing US data, strong big tech earnings and the BoJ policy announcement.ASX 200 underperformed after the prior day's losses caught up with the index on return from holiday. Nikkei 225 was initially choppy and briefly dipped into negative territory as participants braced for the BoJ policy announcement and whether the central bank flags a reduction in bond buying, but then surged as the central bank kept policy settings unchanged and refrained from any major hawkish surprises. Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp. were underpinned by strength in tech and property, while the constructive mood was also facilitated by a meeting between US Secretary of State Blinken and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang where it was stated that the US-China relationship has stabilised although negative factors are building.

European bourses, Stoxx 600 (+0.5%) are entirely in the green, though trade has been contained at session highs, as participants await March's US PCE at 13:30 BST. European sectors are almost entirely in the green, with the exception of Chemicals, following poor IMCD (-9.1%) results. Tech tops the pile, with optimism lifted following strong large-cap Tech earnings in the US. US Equity Futures (ES +0.7%, NQ +0.9%, RTY +0.1%) are entirely in the green, with the NQ outperforming, benefitting from significant pre-market strength in both Google (+11.1%) and Microsoft (+3.6%), after reporting strong earnings after-market.

Geopolitics: Middle East

DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap

It’s been a volatile 24 hours in markets, but in spite of a selloff yesterday, there’s increasing positivity this morning thanks to strong results from Microsoft and Alphabet after last night’s close. Both companies exceeded revenue and earnings expectations, with Alphabet seeing the larger beat on profitability, as their growth was boosted by demand for cloud computing and AI-related offerings. That’s seen Alphabet rise by over 11% in after-hours trading, while Microsoft is up more than -4%, having both been down in the main session yesterday. In turn, futures on the S&P 500 are currently up +0.81%, which is a significant turnaround from yesterday, as the index closed -0.46% lower, and that was only after recovering from initial losses that had pushed it down -1.60%.

That positivity has continued into Asian markets overnight, which comes as the Bank of Japan left their interest rates unchanged at their latest meeting. That’s seen the Japanese Yen weaken further, and it’s currently trading at 156.11 per dollar, which is its weakest level since 1990. Front-end government bond yields have also fallen overnight in Japan, with the 2yr yield down -0.7bps to 0.29%. And for equities, all the major indices have risen, including the Nikkei (+0.74%), the KOSPI (+1.10%), the Hang Seng (+1.98%), the CSI 300 (+1.03%) and the Shanghai Comp (+0.79%).

Before that overnight reversal, markets had struggled yesterday, as challenging data and poor earnings led to a notable selloff. That meant investors pushed back the timing of rate cuts yet again, and the 2yr Treasury yield (+7.1bps) closed at 4.998%, so almost at 5% for the first time since mid-November. That was mainly driven by the Q1 US GDP release, which had the unfortunate combination of a downside surprise on growth, and an upside surprise on inflation. As we found out in 2022, that stagflationary mix can potentially be a bad recipe for markets, so it wasn’t a surprise to see equities and bonds lose ground simultaneously even if equities have since been busy making up their initial losses.

In terms of the details, growth came in at an annualised rate of +1.6% (vs. +2.5% expected), which is the slowest growth since Q2 2022. But more alarmingly for markets, core PCE surprised on the upside, with an annualised rate of +3.7% in Q1 (vs. +3.4% expected). Headline PCE was also strong, at +3.4% in Q1, and core services ex housing (a measure Fed Chair Powell has cited in the past) was at +5.1%. So whichever way you crunch the numbers, this clearly isn’t the sort of inflation momentum where the Fed could be comfortable cutting rates. We’ll get the monthly US PCE numbers for March today within the spending report as well. If you’re looking for positives on growth, final private domestic sales came in at 3.1%, with the slowing in headline GDP growth coming from net exports, inventories and government spending. So domestic demand still holding up well. However you could argue that just ties in with the strong inflation component.

Unsurprisingly, that release meant markets dialled back the odds of rate cuts anytime soon. For instance, the chance of a rate cut by the July meeting fell from 50% the previous day to 34% afterwards. And for the year as a whole, futures are now pricing in just 34bps of cuts by the December meeting, down from 43bps the previous day and 67bps at the start of the month. So futures are now pricing the most hawkish profile we’ve seen to date in this hiking cycle, at least in terms of where rates are set to be by the end of 2024. Indeed for the first time, the first 25bp cut isn’t fully priced in until the December 2024 meeting.

With investors pricing out rate cuts, US Treasuries slumped and yields hit their highest levels of 2024 so far. In particular, the 2yr Treasury yield (+7.1bps) saw a closing value of 4.998%, having reached 5.02% intra-day. And similarly, the 10yr yield was up +6.2bps to 4.70%, although this morning it’s since come down -1.0bps to 4.69%. Bear in mind that just after Christmas, the 10yr yield hit an intraday low of 3.78%, so it’s moved up by almost 100bps from that point now. At the same time, there was a decent spike in real yields, with the 10yr real yield (+4.4bps) reaching a post-November high of 2.28%.

That trend was echoed in Europe, where investors lowered their expectations for ECB rate cuts this year, and now see just 68bps of cuts by December’s meeting, down -5.5bps on the day. As in the US, that meant 10yr yields hit new YTD highs, with those on 10yr bunds (+4.1bps) up to 2.63%, 10yr OATs (+3.7bps) up to 3.13%, and 10yr gilts (+2.8bps) up to 4.36%. For now at least, a June rate cut from the ECB is still seen as an 84% probability, but from Monday we’ll start to get the flash CPI prints for April, so it’ll be interesting to see if that changes anything.

For equities, this backdrop meant it was a tough day across the board even if the recovery was steady as the US session progressed. All the major indices fell, including the S&P 500 (-0.46%), the NASDAQ (-0.64%) and the Dow Jones (-0.98%). Rebounds by Nvidia (+3.71%) and Tesla (+4.97%) helped limit and reverse the earlier larger losses. But Meta (-10.56%) was the worst performer in the entire S&P 500 following its earnings release the previous day, meaning that the Magnificent 7 (-1.19%) underperformed despite the gains for Nvidia and Tesla. IBM (-8.25%) lost significant ground after its release the previous evening as well.

Over in Europe, the STOXX 600 (-0.64%) also saw a decent decline, although the FTSE 100 (+0.48%) was again an exception as it hit another record high, aided by a surge in Anglo American (+16.10%), which was the index’s best performer after BHP proposed a takeover. The proposed deal would bring together two of the world’s largest mining companies and create a clear number one globally. Our mining team think the deal rationale is about global scale and growth in copper, a structurally tight commodity which is key to future global electrification. Copper prices have risen by +17.6% so far this year, and overnight they’re trading at their highest level since April 2022. The mining team’s note (link here) runs through the deal terms and other talking points.

Looking at yesterday’s other data, the US weekly initial jobless claims fell to 207k in the week ending April 20 (vs. 215k expected), which is their lowest level in a couple of months. Otherwise, pending home sales grew by +3.4% in March (vs. +0.4% expected), reaching a 13-month high.

To the day ahead now, and data releases include US PCE inflation for March, along with personal income and personal spending. In addition, there the University of Michigan’s final consumer sentiment index for April, and in the Euro Area, we’ll get the M3 money supply for March. Finally, earnings releases include Exxon Mobil and Chevron.

2024-04-26 08:25:00,China Is Pivotal For US Inflation's Path,https://web.archive.org/web/20240426145556/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/china-pivotal-us-inflations-path,"Authored by Simon White, Bloomberg macro strategist,

Amore forthright response from China to its deflationary predicament would further support US inflation that is already proving sticky, adding to longer-term upwards pressure on term premium and thus yields.

There are upside risks to the US PCE release today after the higher-than-expected core-PCE price index released on Thursday.

Inflation is more stubborn than most expected.

That’s proven to be the case even without China so far managing to engineer robust recovery.

The San Francisco Fed separates out core PCE to a cyclical and an acyclical component, with the first being those inputs to PCE most correlated to Fed policy and acyclical is anything left over.

Most of the fall in core inflation has been driven by the acyclical component, while the cyclical has only fallen marginally, inferring that much of the disinflation was not directly down to Fed policy.

The acyclical component, though, is highly correlated to China PPI,i.e. China is a big driver of global inflation pressures. If the country had had stronger recovery, it is likely the US (and other countries) would be contending with a larger inflation problem than they currently have.

That’s why China’s next move is so important.Falling bond yields, in contrast to rising ones in almost every other country, signal the economy is nearing a crunch point. Typically, China has responded with much broader stimulus - reflected in rising M1 growth - when yields have seen such a fall.

If it responds similarly again, inflation pressures in the US will receive an unwelcome boost even as it is already dealing with price growth that is becoming embedded.

2024-04-26 08:39:04,Fed's Favorite Inflation Indicator Prints Hotter-Than-Expected As Savings Rate Plunges,https://web.archive.org/web/20240426145556/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/feds-favorite-inflation-indicator-prints-hotter-expected-savings-rate-plunges#comment-stream,"With inflation data surprising to the upside recently...

...the doves' last chance for sooner than later rate-cuts is today's Core PCE Deflator - often described as The Fed's favorite inflation signal. Last month saw an uptick in the headline deflator and following yesterday's core PCE rise for Q1, all eyes are on the March data released this morning.

However,both the headline and core PCE Deflator data printed hotter than expected(+2.7% vs +2.6% exp vs +2.5% prior and +2.8% vs +2.7% exp vs +2.8% prior respectively)...

The silver lining is that this hot PCE print is 'dovish' relative to the GDP-based data we saw yesterday, with whisper numbers of +0.4 to +0.5% MoM (vs the +0.3% print).

But still - it's not good for the doves.

As WSJ Fed Whisperer Nick Timiraos notes, the 3-Month annualized core PCE jumped to 4.4%...

TheService sector led the MoM and YoY accelerationin headline PCE...

And forCore PCE, it was Services prices toothat drove the acceleration...

The so-calledSuperCore - Services inflation ex-Shelter - rose once again, and was revised higher...

Stripping it back even further,Transportation Services and 'Other Services'were the biggest gainers in SuperCore...

Income and Spending both rose again on a MoM basis withspending outpacing income (again).The 0.8% MoM rise in spending was the highest since Jan 2023...

Spending is accelerating fast relative to incomes (on a YoY basis) - and remember this is allnominal...

On the income side, government and private wage growth accelerated:

Govt wages rose to 8.5% YoY, from 8.3%, the highest Dec 22

Private wages rose to 5.5% YoY, from 5.4%, highest since Dec 22 as well

Which meant the personal savings rate plunged to 3.2% from 3.6% - its lowest since Nov 2022...

And the soaring credit card balance explains how people are getting by...

And all this amid the fourth straight month of government handouts...

Finally, while the markets are exuberant at thesurvey-based disinflation,we do note that it's not all sunshine and unicorns.The vast majority of the reduction in inflation has been 'cyclical'...

Acyclical Core PCE inflation remains extremely high, although it has fallen from its highs.

Is The (apolitical) Fed going to be able to cut at all this year like Joe Biden said they would?

2024-04-26 08:55:00,Ukrainian Drone Strikes Target Russian Oil Refineries Again Despite White House Pleas,https://web.archive.org/web/20240426145556/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/russian-refineries-under-attack-again-brent-crude-nears-90-mark,"Just days after the Biden administration signed a new military aid package worth billions of dollars to Ukraine, Kyiv launched a series of suicide drone attacks on Russian oil refineries.Biden's top officials have pleaded with Kyiv to stop attacks on Russia's energy infrastructurebecause of the fears that turmoil in crude markets would send pump prices in the US higher ahead of the presidential elections in November.

""Our region is again under attack by Ukrainian UAVs,"" Smolensk Governor Vasily Anokhin wrote in a post on Telegram on Wednesday. Kamikaze drones damaged oil facilities in western Russia.

Another drone attack hit the Lipetsk region further south, which is home to steel production plants and pharmaceutical sites, Governor Igor Artamonov said.

""The Kyiv criminal regime tried to hit infrastructure in Lipetsk industrial zone,"" Artamonov said.

The Moscow Timespointed out:

A source in the Ukrainian defense sector confirmed to AFP on Wednesday that drones in the service of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) had carried out the attacks.

The source made no mention of the attack on Lipetsk but claimed two oil depots were destroyed in the Smolensk region.

""Rosneft lost two storage and pumping bases for fuels and lubricants in the towns of Yartsevo and Rozdorovo,"" the source said, referring to the Russian state-controlled energy giant.

The Financial Times, citing unnamed US officials, recently said long-range drones have hit at least 20 energy facilities deep within Russia so far this year. Kyiv's drone attacks on Russia's energy complex have been frightening for the Biden administration, as Brent prices have risen to the $90/bbl level on higher war risk premiums. Higher energy costs feed into inflation as stagflation concerns mount in the US. Also, gasoline pump prices in the US are inching closer to thepolitically sensitive$4 level.

According to AAA data, the average cost of gas at the pump across the US was $3.66 as of Thursday, up from $3.10 in mid-January.

""The recent uptick in US consumer price inflation, driven by services, housing and fuel, is already of concern to the Biden administration, which is hoping to secure a second term in the November election,"" Markus Korhonen, senior associate at geopolitical risk consultancy S-RM, toldNewsweek.

In recent weeks, Brent prices jumped to the $90bbl to $92bbl range on a higher war risk premium as Israel and Iran volleyed missiles and drones at each other. Prices sank to as low as the $85bbl handle as the market saw the Middle East conflict was just theatrics. However, prices have increased from $85bbl earlier this week, to $89.50 on Friday morning - perhaps on new fears of tighter Russia supplies.

The latestBloombergdata shows Russian seaborne crude exports hit a multi-month high in the four weeks to April 21. Refineries in the country have struggled to be repaired from the series of drone attacks as oil processing sinks to lows last seen in May 2023 when floods forced the Orsk refinery offline.

So far, Ukraine has only attacked oil-processing facilities deep within Russia, avoiding crude and crude product export ports.

""Should Ukraine begin also targeting crude oil facilities, this could threaten Russia's overall production and exports and, more meaningfully, global oil prices would tick up, driving up inflation and cost-of-living pressures in the US and elsewhere,"" said Korhonen, adding, ""It would also raise the prospects of Russia retaliating, for example, targeting energy infrastructure that the West relies on.""

The ultimate goal of Ukraine's drone attacks is to reduce Moscow's oil revenues that finance the war. This means that Russia's crude export ports will be targeted at some point. And we're 100% sure the Biden administration is terrified about this ahead of the elections.

If that happens, ""it would not only bring up the price of oil, it would put a lot of pressure on inflation because of the impact on prices,"" said O'Donnell.

The question becomes when does Kyiv begin hitting Russia's crude export terminals.

One of my favorite investors that I love reading and following, Harris Kupperman, has offered up his latest thoughts on the market this week. Attached is part of his Q1 2024 letter, reprinted with Harris’ permission.

Harris is the founder ofPraetorian Capital, a hedge fund focused on using macro trends to guide stock selection.

Harris is one of my favorite follows and I find his opinions - especially on macro and commodities - to be extremely resourceful. I’m certain my readers will find the same. I was excited when he offered up his latest thoughts, published below (slightly edited for grammar, bold and bracket emphasis is QTR’s).

Please be sure to read both my and Harris’ disclaimers, located at the bottom of this post

Ever since I began investing in stocks, over two decades ago, I have been of the view that fiscal deficits cannot simply be papered over with money printing. That is the road to ruin for all nations that have tried it. However, when the deficits are moderate, and economic growth is strong, the deficits matter less. As a result, we’ve been able to avoid a crisis, despite our nation’s level of absolute debt, and the debt-to-GDP being on an ascent. Since COVID, both metrics have expanded at a far more rapid pace. It’s the sort of thing you’d see in an Emerging Market economy, right before they would experience a crisis.

As the wealthiest nation on earth, with the world’s functional reserve currency, the rules are somewhat different here, but they only stay different for as long as we do not abuse our status. Increasingly, I believe that we’ve crossed a line, where our fiscal balances begin to look a lot more like those of an Emerging Market. As I see zero inkling of any spending restraint amongst those in Congress, nor the two leading candidates for President, I believe that our deficits will continue to expand. In such a scenario, the rules will eventually be reversed, and the Central Bank will be forced to worry about the health of the bond market—at the expense of the economy and the jobs market.

I believe we’re nearing a point where the bond market has an aneurism, as it refuses to Fund the Treasury’s spending levels [QTR: Exactlywhat I discussedwith Jack Boroudjian days ago]. We’ve seen this play out in many Emerging Markets before. In such a scenario, the natural knee-jerk response is for the Central Bank to intervene in the yield curve, buying longer-dated bonds, usually with printed money. It buys time, but expands the money supply, leading to further distortions to the economy. I also call this “Project Zimbabwe.” In such a world, there may be a short-term decline in asset prices as the bond market seizes-up, followed by an explosion in inflation-linked asset prices as investors realize what’s underway. Alternatively, we may simply sleep-walk into “Project Zimbabwe” without ever having experienced that dip. The question for me, has always been how to avoid the short-term dip, while being prepared for the longer-term rip. I’ve increasingly been of the view that it’s better to suffer some pain, rather than miss it. Particularly, as precious metals, are already telling me that the timing of this is increasingly imminent.

For the past two years, this Fund has under-performed my expectations, as we’ve been heavily weighted towards inflationary assets, during a time when inflation rates were in decline. As the Central Bank is forced to pivot, I believe that our portfolio should finally perform more in line with my expectations, albeit with the potential for a nasty dip along the way. Everything in my views is simply a reflection of the coming bond market crisis that I believe to be almost inevitable. Should I be right about that, not much else will matter to capital markets, except the timing and the...(READ THIS FULL NOTE & HARRIS' TOP 5 CORE POSITIONS HERE).

Video has emerged of a drag queen leading children barely older than toddler age in chanting “Free Palestine” during a so called “Queer Storytime for Palestine”event in Massachusetts.

The event, featuring a drag queen going by the name of ‘Lil Miss Hot Mess’, took place earlier this month at the Northampton Center for the Arts.

The event was advertisedby the organisersas“dancing, celebrating Palestine culture, learning about queer heroes and doing arts and crafts.”

According to the hosts, Valley Families for Palestine, profits from the event were donated to alQaws, a Palestinian organisation that is “working for queer liberation.”

Video captured at the event shows ‘Hot Mess’ reading her book titled “If You’re a Drag Queen and You Know It,” andordering the kids “If you’re a drag queen and you know it shout ‘Free Palestine.'”

First off, gay people are at best severely disrespected, and at worst murdered in Gaza and other Palestinian areas. In terms of how gay-friendly it is,The LGBT Equality Indexranks Palestine as 192 out of 197 countries. Syria, Somalia and Yemen are ranked as more open to homosexuality.

It’s safe to say that a drag queen encouraging American kindergarteners to say ‘free Palestine’ is not really going to shift the needle as far as that situation is concerned.

Secondly, these children are clearly being subjected to a double dose of ideological and political indoctrination.

2024-04-26 09:35:00,"Anglo American Rejects BHP's Takeover Deal, Calls It ""Highly Unattractive""",https://web.archive.org/web/20240426145556/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/anglo-american-rejects-bhps-takeover-deal-calls-it-highly-unattractive,"The world's largest global diversified miner, BHP, is being forced to significantly raise its buyout offer of Anglo American or walk away from theproposed all-share dealvalued at £31.1 billion ($38.9 billion).

""The BHP proposal is opportunistic and fails to value Anglo American's prospects, while significantly diluting the relative value upside participation of Anglo American's shareholders relative to BHP's shareholders,""Anglo chairman Stuart Chambers wrote in a statement on Friday.

Chambers continued,""The proposed structure is also highly unattractive, creating substantial uncertainty and execution risk borne almost entirely by Anglo American, its shareholders and its other stakeholders.""

The first indication that Anglo executives would reject the deal came Thursday afternoon when Reuters reported two sources familiar with talks with top Anglo investors who said the offer was 'unattractive.'

Anglo owns massive copper mines in South America. The miner has become an acquisition target of BHP solely to create the world's largest copper mining giant, with control of about 10% of the global copper mining supply. Copper mining supplies are dwindling, and demand is expected to soar as power grids worldwide are upgraded to support the green energy transition.

The Financial Review quoted hedge fund manager Rafi Lamm of Melbourne's L1 Capital as saying BHP would have to increase its bid for Anglo's assets, which have been underappreciated by the market and make strategic sense for BHP.

""We think it's a sensible move by BHP and we think they can afford to pay the proposed deal pricing and a lot more,"" Lamm said.

James Whiteside, head of mining and metals corporate research at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said BHP will have to raise its offer to bring its value""closer to the share price in 2023 before operational issues emerged.""

On Thursday, BHP proposed anall-share dealvalued at £31.1 billion ($38.9 billion). The transaction depends on Anglo spinning off its South African iron ore and platinum businesses to its shareholders. The offer is conditional and non-binding at £25.08 a share, or about a 14% premium to Anglo's closing share price on Wednesday.

BHP investor Equity Trustees Asset Management told the Sydney Morning Herald that BHP's bid to buy Anglo American made sense strategically,""but much will depend on what BHP will eventually pay.""

""Having a bit more copper in the portfolio is a positive. If copper can move up from here this will likely offset any errors made in its purchase price of Anglo,""Equity Trustees head of equities Chris Haynes said.

Haynes added,""As we know, large acquisitions like this always have problems and will likely weigh on the BHP stock price in the short term.""

Shares in BHP fell on Friday, ending the Australian session at 4.6% lower.

Meanwhile, copper prices hit $10,000 a ton for the first time in two years, fueled by speculation of dwindling supplies and robust demand from the green energy transition.

Copper bulls like BlackRock and Trafigura Group have said the base metal must move higher to spur new mine development.

BofA recently warned, ""The copper supply crisis is here.""

Let's not forget our note titled""The Next AI Trade,""which explains the investment opportunities in upgrading America's grid as generative AI data centers increase power demand.

And Jefferies is on it: ""Copper Demand in Data Centers.""

Recall billionaire mining investor Robert Friedland, who explained last year on Bloomberg TV that ""copper prices might explode ten times.""

2024-04-26 10:09:57,UMich Inflation Expectations Accelerated In April To 2024 Highs,https://web.archive.org/web/20240426145556/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/umich-inflation-expectations-accelerated-april-2024-highs,"Short-term inflation expectations rose... again...according to the latest UMich sentiment survey with 1-year expectations at 3.2% final, up from preliminary 3.1% for April, and 2.9% for March. This is the highest level since Nov 2023...

The headline sentiment also declined in April from three-year-highs.Consumers’ perceptions of their current financial situation and the economic outlook over the next year both slid to four-month lows. The current conditions gauge dropped to 79 from 82.5. A measure of expectations fell to 76 from 77.4.

While “consumers’ frustration over high prices in their day-to-day spending decisions grew this month, price concerns for large purchases - durable goods, vehicles, and homes - were all little changed from last month,’’Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, said in a statement.

About 38% of consumers reported that high prices were weighing down their living standards, up from 33% who said so last month.

Sentiment gauges also provide insight into voters’ feelings about the economy and their finances leading up to the presidential election in November. President Joe Biden’s recent polling bump in key battleground states has mostly evaporated amid economic pessimism, the latest Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll found.

“Consumers continue to express uncertainty about the future trajectory of the economy pending the outcomes of the upcoming election,”Hsu said.

Partisan differences in views of the economy remain pronounced.While Democrats and Independents saw little change in sentiment this month, sentiment for Republicans fell about 6 index points.

Republicans reported declines for four of the five components of the sentiment index, reflecting their deteriorating views across multiple facets of the economy. Despite these declines,sentiment for Republicans remains well above 2022 and 2023 levels.

In fact, the current reading for Republicans’ Expectations Index is the second highest (after last month) since the end of 2020, as the Trump presidency came to a close.

The protests, which began at Columbia University, have expanded nationwide - with copycat tent cities erected at colleges including Harvard, Yale, Berkeley in California, the Ohio State University and Emory in Georgia,with organized branches of the Soros-funded Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) having organized them.

Biden has sparked a wildfire.pic.twitter.com/YXbHCKONcm

Which might explain this:

Something odd about those campus tent encampments. Almost all the tents are identical - same design, same size, same fresh-out-of-the-box appearance. Which suggests that rather than an organic process, whereby students would bring a variety of individual tents, someone or some…pic.twitter.com/86JV5BD9NM

The parent organization of SJP has been funded by a constellation of nonprofits which all lead to Soros.

At three colleges, the protests are being encouraged by paid radicals who are “fellows” of a Soros-funded group called the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR).

USCPR provides up to $7,800 for its community-based fellows and between $2,880 and $3,660 for its campus-based “fellows” in return for spending eight hours a week organizing “campaigns led by Palestinian organizations.”

They are trained to “rise up, to revolution.”

The radical group received at least$300,000from Soros’ Open Society Foundations since 2017 and also took in $355,000 from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund since 2019. -NY Post

The group has three ""fellows"" who have helped propel the protests into a nationwide phenomenon, which you can read more abouthere...

We're sure if the protests get violent, prosecutors will take appropriate action, yes?

And while many of the protesters are just morons...

“I wish I was more educated.”Video captured at New York University shows that some of the students protesting there have no idea why. Full report:https://t.co/iYSbhaxxEfpic.twitter.com/iqXpoZexiP

Some of them are quite spicy, like the leader of Columbia's encampment...

“Be glad — be grateful — that I’m not just going out and murdering Zionists. I’ve never murdered anyone in my life, and I *hope* to keep it that way.” This is a top leader of@Columbia’s encampment, with whom the school is “negotiating,” expanding on his thoughts about how Israel…pic.twitter.com/ugodO4O7M5

Gold trading in China has exploded and stocks of copper have risen sharply prompting speculation that policymakers are on the brink of a yuan devaluation.Even though it’s still a tail-risk, it’s one requiring greater vigilance as the economy becomes increasingly deflationary, redoubling capital outflow pressures.

The yuan has been steadily falling versus the dollar this year. So far the decline has been measured, butactivity in commodities has prompted conjecture that China is about to orchestrate a significant one-off yuan devaluation.Futures gold trading in China has moved sharply higher, and the net long position has been rising.

Also, there has been a sharp rise in China’s copper stocks.Copper as well as other commodities is used as a source of collateral in China.

USD/CNY has been bumping up against the upper band of the PBOC’s fix for the currency pair.

China has a nominally closed capital account, but it is de facto leaky. Capital outflow is rising,and this puts further pressure on the economy as it has a geared negative effect on domestic liquidity.

Allowing the yuan to depreciate against the dollar (it is appreciating against most other currencies) takes some of the pressure off.

China, though, has been unofficially intervening, via the state banks, to stabilize the yuan’s fall.

Nonetheless, it is still less likely than not they will countenance a significant devaluation of the yuan versus the dollar.

First, it would compromise the financial stability that China has sought to obtain.

Second, it risks a tariff backlash from the US.

Third it may be counter-productive if it looks panicky and prompts even more capital outflow.

The stockpiling could well be for other reasons.

Rising global inflation risks (there is more to come, and even China will likely soon face consumer inflation);

reserve diversification in a more multi-polar world;

and raw materials for solar (AI needs a lot of energy) and EVs, and so on.

China planning for an invasion of Taiwan is another tail-risk that can’t be completely discounted.

Falling bond yields, though, show China is nearing a crunch point (read why here) and will need to do something soon to avert a debt deflation.

Even though a full-scale devaluation is less likely, it’s a non-negligible risk that can’t be ignored.

2024-04-26 10:50:00,JPY Plunges To Fresh 34-Year-Lows After BoJ Does Nothing... Again,https://web.archive.org/web/20240426145556/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/jpy-plunges-fresh-34-year-lows-after-boj-does-nothing-again#comment-stream,"Having already lost more than 10% of its value versus the US dollar this year, the yen plunged further overnight after Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda indicated monetary policy will stay easy as he kept rates unchanged and showed little to no support for the embattled currency during the press conference.

While investors had not expected the BoJ to change its policy this week, there was anexpectations that Ueda would strike a hawkish tone regarding future rate rises to slow the yen’s decline.

Instead, Ueda said at a news conference on Friday that the central bank’s board members judged there was “no major impact” from the weaker yen on underlying inflation for now.

“Currency rates is not a target of monetary policy to directly control,”he said.

“But currency volatility could be an important factor in impacting the economy and prices.If the impact on underlying inflation becomes too big to ignore, it may be a reason to adjust monetary policy.”

And that sent the currency reeling (amid chaotic swings) back above 157/USD...

“There is no intention by the BoJ to stop the yen’s decline, at least looking at its statement and its outlook report,” said UBS economist Masamichi Adachi.

“The finance ministry will have to act [to stem the yen weakness]... It would have been more effective if both the government and the BoJ faced the same direction,”he added.

Blowing further below the 'interventionist' levels seen previously to a fresh 34-year low...

“Markets remain on high alert for any indication of whether the yen’s current weakness will be interpreted as a lasting inflationary signal,” said Naomi Fink, global strategist at Nikko Asset Management.

“The BoJ however is likelier to find any knock-on impact from yen weakness upon inflation as more concerning than short-term currency moves.”

Driving the depreciation is the yawning gap between the interest rates in the US- which are at highest in decades after the Fed’s aggressive tightening cycle last year - and those in Japan, where borrowing costs remain stubbornly low near zero.

“Intervention is possible at anytime, but it could have been just someone selling a large lot, which stoked intervention speculation and spurred follow-through moves,” said Koji Fukaya, a fellow at Market Risk Advisory Co. in Tokyo.

“It does not look like intervention, but the only way to confirm is to check data that will be released later by the Ministry of Finance.”

Policymakers have repeatedly warned that depreciation won’t be tolerated if it goes too far too fast.

Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki reiterated after the BoJ meeting that the government will respond appropriately to foreign exchange moves.

Potential triggers for interventions are public holidays in Japan on Monday and Friday next week, which bring the risk of volatility amid thin trading.

“Should the yen fall further from here, like after the BOJ decision in September 2022, the possibility of intervention will increase,” said Hirofumi Suzuki, chief currency strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.

“It is not the level but it’s the speed that will trigger the action.”

But so far, nothing! And so the market continues to call Ueda and Suzuki's bluff, knowing full well that a sudden intervention will perhaps briefly support the currency but will pancake the current gains in Japanese stocks.

However, not everyone is convinced intervention is imminent.

In a note this morning, Deutsche Bank says the currency's decline is warranted andfinally marks the day where the market realizes that Japan is following a policy of benign neglect for the yen.

We have long argued that FX intervention is not credible and the toning down of verbal jawboning from the finance minister overnight is on balance a positive from a credibility perspective. The possibility of intervention can't be ruled out if the market turns disorderly, but it is also notable that Governor Ueda played down the importance of the yen in his press conference today as well as signalling no urgency to hike rates. We would frame the ongoing yen collapse around the following points.

Yen weakness is simply not that bad for Japan.The tourism sector is booming, profit margins on the Nikkei are soaring and exporter competitiveness is increasing. True, the cost of imported items is going up. But growth is fine, the government is helping offset some of the cost via subsidies and core inflation is not accelerating. Most importantly, the Japanese are huge foreign asset owners via Japan’s positive net international investment position. Yen weakness therefore leads to huge capital gains on foreign bonds and equities, most easily summarized in the observation that the government pension fund (GPIF) has roughly made more profits over the last two years than the last twenty years combined.

There simply isn't an inflation problem.Japan's core CPI is around 2% and has been decelerating in recent months. The Tokyo CPI overnight was 1.7% excluding one-off effects. To be sure, inflation may well accelerate again helped by FX weakness and high wage growth. But the starting point of inflation is entirely different to the post-COVID hiking cycles of the Fed and ECB. By extension, the inflation pain is far less and the urgency to hike far less too. No where is this more obvious than the fact that Japanese consumer confidence are close to their cycle highs.

Negative real rates are great.There is a huge attraction to running negative real rates for the consolidated government balance sheet. As we demonstrated last year, it creates fiscal space via a $20 trillion carry trade while also generating asset gains for Japan's wealthy voting base. This encourages the persistent domestic capital outflows we have been highlighting as a key driver of yen weakness over the last year and that have pushed Japan's broad basic balance to being one of the weakest in the world. It is not speculators that are weakening the yen but the Japanese themselves.

The bottom line, Deutscxhe concludes, is thatfor the JPY to turn stronger the Japanese need to unwind their carry trade.But for this to make sense the Bank of Japan needs to engineer an expedited hiking cycle similar to the post-COVID experiences of other central banks. Time will tell if the BoJ is moving too slow and generating a policy mistake.A shift in BoJ inflation forecasts to well above 2% over their forecast horizon would be the clearest signal of a shift in reaction function. But this isn’t happening now.

The Japanese are enjoying the ride.

But there is potential for yen upside as Bloomberg's Simon White notes thatprofit taking on foreign asset positions might soon prompt some yen repatriation and pressure USD/JPY lower.

If it is perceived that the yen won’t get much cheaper due to intervention risk, domestic investors might choose to start switching some of their US equity positions back to the domestic market, repatriating yen and pressuring USD/JPY lower in the process.

The chart below shows that on the year, the Nasdaq in yen terms and the Nikkei are both up by the same 13%-14% on the year. A stronger yen would present an ongoing headwind to the US position.

Equity positions are typically less FX hedged than bond positions, meaning that the repatriation of the currency is not neutered by the unwind of the hedge.

The dynamics of spot trading, options barriers and potential intervention as well as US PCE data released later today will dominate the currency’s short-term gyrations, but the slightly longer-term considerations of profit taking on foreign positions will start to drive the medium-term outlook.

Once that trend establishes itself, longer-term drivers of the yen will come into focus.Japan is the world’s largest net creditor, and there is a significant structural short in the yen.

The country’s net international investment position is $3.3 trillion, but its net position in portfolio assets, i.e.so-called hot flows that could be liquidated quickly, is $4.4 trillion.

Only a fraction of that being repatriated has significant potential to drive the yen considerably higher.

The question is, how much pain is China willing to take from its regional neighbor's 'devaluation'?

2024-04-26 12:45:00,These States Are Making It Illegal For Illegal Immigrants To Enter,https://web.archive.org/web/20240427121603/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/these-states-are-making-it-illegal-illegal-immigrants-enter#comment-stream,"Authored by Darlene McCormick Sanchez via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Conservative states across the country—Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Tennessee, Georgia, and Oklahoma—are taking border security matters into their own hands, proposing or passing legislation targeting illegal immigration.

The Oklahoma legislature just passed abilldesigned to prohibit illegal immigrants from entering or living in the state.

HB 4156 states: “A person commits an impermissible occupation if the person is an alien and willfully and without permission enters and remains in the State of Oklahoma without having first obtained legal authorization to enter the United States.”

The bill passed the state House and Senate by wide margins and Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, is expected to sign it into law.

The legislature declared the issue a crisis in the state and stated in the bill: “Throughout the state, law enforcement comes into daily and increasingly frequent contact with foreign nationals who entered the country illegally or who remain here illegally.

“Often, these persons are involved with organized crime such as drug cartels, they have no regard for Oklahoma’s laws or public safety, and they produce or are involved with fentanyl distribution, sex trafficking, and labor trafficking.”

Under the new law, a conviction related to “impermissible occupation” would be considered a misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in a county jail, a fine of up to $500, or both.

Subsequent offenses are felonies, punishable by up to two years in prison, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.

Illegal immigrants who are barred from the country or have been issued a removal order by an immigration judge, and then enter Oklahoma will face a felony charge carrying a possible sentence of up to two years in prison, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.

In all instances, those found guilty must leave Oklahoma within 72 hours of being convicted or released from custody.

The law requires police to collect fingerprints, photographs, and biometric data, which will be cross-checked with Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation databases.

“The failure of the federal government to address this issue … has turned every state into a border state,” said bill sponsor state Rep. Charles Mr. McCall said in a statement.

“Those who want to work through the process of coming to our country legally are more than welcome to come to Oklahoma; we would love to have them here. We will not reward [illegal immigration] in Oklahoma, and we will protect our state borders.”

U.S. border authorities have apprehended more than 9 million illegal immigrants nationwide under President Joe Biden, according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP)data.

Under the administration’s catch-and-release policy, many have been released into the United States and have taken up residence all over the country.

Texas’ law, Senate Bill 4, makes it a state crime to enter Texas outside legal ports of entry.

The new law was set to go into effect in March, but has been blocked and is currently tied up in the courts.

Earlier this month, Iowa’s Republican Gov. Kim ReynoldssignedSenate File 2340 into law.

The new law, which goes into effect July 1, makes it a misdemeanor to be in the state or attempt to enter the state after being deported, denied admission to the United States, or if an individual has an outstanding deportation order.

Being in the state illegally becomes a felony under certain circumstances such as the accused having two or more misdemeanor convictions involving drugs or crimes against a person.

As with the Texas law, it gives judges the discretion to drop the charges if the illegal immigrant agrees to return to the country from which he or she entered the United States.

“Those who come into our country illegally have broken the law, yet Biden refuses to deport them,” Ms. Reynolds stated in a news release.

“This bill gives Iowa law enforcement the power to do what he is unwilling to do: enforce immigration laws already on the books.”

Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed anew lawthis month that requires law enforcement agencies to communicate with federal immigration authorities if they discover people are in the country illegally, requiring in most cases cooperation in the process of identifying, catching, detaining, and deporting them.

The law takes effect July 1.

“When there is an interaction with law enforcement, it’s important that the appropriate authorities are notified of the status of that individual,” Mr. Lee, a Republican, told reporters after signing the bill into law. “I think that makes sense. So, I’m in support of that legislation.”

Members of the Tennessee House blamed President Biden’s lack of border enforcement for the necessity of the law.

“President Biden’s administration has delivered this pain to our doorsteps,” Tennessee state Rep. Chris Todd said on the House floor.

In Georgia, lawmakers passed House Bill 1105 that would require jailers to check the immigration status of inmates.

Thebillis part of an ongoing political response to the February slaying of nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus, allegedly by an illegal immigrant from Venezuela.

The man, Jose Antonio Ibarra, was arrested in February on murder and assault charges in the death of the 22-year-old.

Immigration officials say Mr. Ibarra, 26, crossed into the United States illegally in 2022. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed to Sen. Lindsey Graham(R-S.C.)  that Mr. Ibarra was paroled into the country illegally due to “capacity problems” at border detention facilities

The Georgia bill was sent to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk on April 3 and awaits his signature, at which time most measures would take effect immediately.

Texas’ neighbor, Louisiana, is considering the passage ofSB 388, a GOP-led bill that would allow state police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants within the state.

The law passed the chamber on April 8 along party lines and headed to the House, also controlled by Republicans.

“Louisiana is one step closer to securing our border and addressing our illegal immigration crisis,” Republican state Sen. Valarie Hodges, the bill’s sponsor, posted on X.

The battleground state of Arizona passed a law similar to Texas’ HB 4, but its Democratic Gov. Katy Hobbs vetoed it.

That inspired the Legislature to draft a ballot measure to be put to voters in November that would require businesses to use E-verify. E-verify is a voluntary federalonline servicefor employers to check an employee’s eligibility to work in the United States against Department of Homeland Security and Social Security records.

New Hampshire, which is Republican-led, passed SB 504 allowing police to bring criminal trespassing charges against people suspected of illegally entering the United States from Canada. The measure must be approved by the House to advance.

Cities and counties in red and blue states are also pushing back in creative ways to stop illegal immigrants from coming into their jurisdictions.

“They’re basically dumped on their doorstep,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a “pro-immigrant, low-immigration” think tank.

In June 2023, New York City under Democratic Mayor Eric Adams suedmore than 30 New Yorklocal governments alleging they issued unlawful executive orders prohibiting temporary housing for illegal immigrants in their jurisdictions.

Counties such as Orange and Rockland in upstate New York were successful in using local zoning laws to stop the mayor from busing illegal immigrants to live in their hotels.

The state Supreme Court granted Rockland a temporary restraining order against the mayor’s plan after the county argued that local zoning laws bar hotels from operating as shelters.

Orange County was granted a similar ruling.

Likewise, zoning was used by the city of Taunton, Massachusetts, to stop illegal immigrants from living in hotels, Ms. Vaughan said.

In May 2023, the state was paying millions of dollars to house some 120 homeless and migrant families at a local hotel long-term.

Taunton city leaders filed a lawsuit against the hotel, claiming it violated its occupancy limit for nearly four months. The city aims to collect $114,600 in fines.

Residents in these small communities often struggle with housing and obtaining services that illegal immigrants get for free, Ms. Vaughan noted."
2024-04-26 16:07:42,Report: Nestle Dumps Sugar Into Baby Food,https://web.archive.org/web/20240428125739/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-26/report-nestle-dumps-sugar-baby-food,"Originally published viaArmageddon Prose:

“Let them eat high-fructose corn syrup!”-Nestle Antoinette

The liberal and loving executives in charge of manufacturing wholesome Nestle foodstuffs to sustain the peasantry have reportedly been busy beavers, dumping unheard-of quantities of processed sugar into its baby feed marketed to Third World mothers.

Related:Kellogg’s CEO Encourages Cash-Strapped Peasants to Eat Cereal For Dinner

ViaPublic Eye(emphasis added):

“Cerelac and Nido are some of Nestlé’s best-selling baby-food brands in low- and middle-income countries… Their sales value in this category was greater than $2.5 billion in 2022.

In its own communications or via third parties,Nestlé promotes Cerelac and Nido as brands whose aim is to help children “live healthier lives”. Fortified with vitamins, minerals and other micronutrients, these products are, according to the multinational, tailored to the needs of babies and young children and help to strengthen their growth, immune system and cognitive development.

But do these infant cereals and powdered milks really offer “the best nutrition,” as Nestlé claims...

Most Cerelac and Nido products marketed in lower-income countries do contain added sugar, often at high levels…

In Senegal and South Africa, Cerelac cereals contain6 grams of added sugar per serving*…

Manufacturers may try to get children accustomed to a certain level of sugar at a very early age, so that they prefer products high in sugar.”

*One need not have done an endocrinology residency at Mount Sinai or whatever to understand how devastating 6 grams of added sugar would be for a 10-pound baby.

Where, pray tell, are all of the vaunted, credentialed medical “experts” on the processed sugar baby-poisoning pandemic?

If one were inclined to conspiracy theory, one might surmise that feeding infants high-fructose corn syrup is nothing but gravy for the medical-industrial complex — a guaranteed lifelong customer created with every feeding!

So where would the incentive lie to intervene?

While Nestle’s baby feed might be going Genghis Khan on their vulnerable little pancreases, it’s going gangbusters for the corporation’s bottom line, which conveniently has been acquiring biomedical firms left and right for decades.

ViaNestle(emphasis added):

“Pamlab, acquired in 2013, specialises in medical food productsfor useunder medicalsupervision in the nutritional management of patients withmild cognitive impairment, depression anddiabetic peripheral neuropathy…

Prometheus Laboratories, acquired in 2011, specialises in diagnostics and licensed speciality pharmaceuticalsin gastroenterology (GI) and oncology…

CM&D Pharma, acquired in 2011, specialises in the development of products for patients with chronic conditionslike chronic kidney disease and gastrointestinal.”

That’s called solving a problem you created in the first place — the #1 marketing play in the marketer’s satanic playbook.

… A play, by the way, Nestle has run for decades with impunity, especially in the Third World where medical illiteracy in the captive populations abounds and where regulatory agencies, such as they exist at all, are bought off much cheaper than they are in the West.

ViaBusiness Insider(emphasis added):

“The New Internationalist published an exposé on Nestlé's marketing practices in 1973, ""Babies Mean Business,"" which described how the company got Third World mothers hooked on baby formula.

But it was ""The Baby Killer,"" a booklet published by London's War On Want organization in 1974, that really blew the lid off the baby formula industry…

Nestlé accomplished this in three ways, said New Internationalist:

Creating a need where none existed.

Convincing consumers the products were indispensable.

Linking products with the most desirable and unattainable concepts—then giving a sample.”

Imagining anything more morally reprehensible than a multinational “food” corporation dumping processed sugar into baby food with no apparent nutritional justification doesn’t come easy, at least not to me.

I can conclude with nothing better than the sage words of Bill Hicks, encouraging marketers to, for once, do something good for the world by removing themselves from it.

¨There’s no rationalization for what you do, and you are Satan’s little helpers. This is not a joke… There’s no joke coming… You are Satan’s spawn… It’s the only way to save your f***ing soul. Kill yourself.¨

March will be lit:1. Reverse repo ends2. BTFP expires3. Fed cuts (allegedly)4. QT ends (allegedly)

Admittedly, we were a couple of weeks off, but trouble has been brewing in the banking sector and tonight - after the close - we get the first bank failure of the year.

The FDIC just seized the troubled Philadelphia bank, Republic First Bancorp and and struck an agreement for the lender’s deposits and the majority of its assets to be bought by Fulton Bank.

Republic Bank had about$6 billion of assets and $4 billion of depositsat the end of January, according to the FDIC (considerably smaller than the $100-200BN assets with SVB and Signature).

The FDICestimated thefailure will cost the deposit insurance fund $667 million.

As The Wall Street Journal reports, Republic First had for months struggled to stay afloat.

Around half of its deposits were uninsured at the end of 2023,according to FDIC data.

Its total equity, or assets minus liabilities, was $96 million at the end of 2023, according to FDIC filings.

That excluded$262 million of unrealized losses on bonds that it labeled “held to maturity,”which means the losses hadn’t counted on its balance sheet.

Its stock, which was delisted from Nasdaq in August, had been near zero.

Republic Bank’s 32 branches across New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York will reopen as branches of Fulton Bank on Saturday,according to a statement from the FDIC.

Depositors of Republic Bank will become depositors of Williamsport, Pennsylvania-based Fulton Bank, the regulator said.

You should not be surprised given that rates are higher now than they were at the start of the SVB crisis - which means, unless banks have hedged hard or dumped their bonds at a loss, they are even more underwater...

U.S. Banks finished the year with almost $400 billion of unrealized losses on held-to-maturity assets. The assumption is this wouldn't be a problem because the Fed would cut A LOT this year but what if that doesn't happen?pic.twitter.com/fsfMCisEd3

Add to this the fact that last week - seasonally-adjusted for tax-season -US banks saw the largest deposit outflows since 9/11 (yes, that 9/11)...

...and, as we showed earlier, absent the $126BN outstanding in The Fed's BTFP bailout fund (which is now terminated and slowly running down as the term loans mature)...

...the banking crisis is back and now the question is ""who's next?""

2024-04-26 19:15:00,Mainstream Media Misrepresenting Crime Statistics In Order To Protect Biden,https://web.archive.org/web/20240427121603/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/mainstream-media-misrepresenting-crime-statistics-order-protect-biden,"Authored by Eric Lundrum via American Greatness,

With the November election less than 7 months away, mainstream media outlets are now choosing to misrepresent the current state of crime in the United States,claiming that crime is declining without providing full context or key details.

As theDaily Callerreports,there are two ways in which the federal government measures crime in the United States: The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR).

Whereas theNCVS asks roughly 240,000 Americans whether or not they’ve been a victimof crime in the last year, theUCR focuses on crimes that have been reported to policewithin the last year and shared with the FBI.

While more people are reporting to the BJS that they have been the victims of crime, the FBI is reporting fewer crimes through the UCR.

The UCR claims that violent crime dropped by 2% from 2021 to 2022, while the NCVS shows the exact opposite, reporting that the number of victims of violent crime increased by a staggering 42.4% from 2021 to 2022;this constitutes a rise from 16.5 victims per 1,000 people to 23.5 victims per 1,000.

Nevertheless, many mainstream media outlets such as CBS, NBC, PBS, NPR, Reuters, and The Hill have all turned to the FBI’s data to claim, falsely, that crime is on the decline. All such reports have failed to mention the crucial data from the NCVS.

Even Joe Biden himself has turned to deliberately misrepresenting the facts by relying solely on the FBI’s data.

“This week, the FBI released data showing that crime declined across nearly every category in 2023,” said Biden recently.

“Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, which every Republican in Congress voted against, we made the largest-ever federal investment in fighting and preventing crime at any time in our history.”

This directly contradicts broad public sentiment in the United States, with a Gallup poll in December finding that 77% of Americans believe crime is getting worse.

2024-04-26 19:40:00,Why You Can't Afford Most Hotels In New York City,https://web.archive.org/web/20240427121603/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/why-you-cant-afford-most-hotels-new-york-city#comment-stream,"Authored by Fred Roeder via RealClearMarkets,

On a Friday night in March 2011, I stayed at an upscale W Hotel on Lexington Avenue in New York City for $124.That hotel later became The Maxwell, but sadly itdidn’t survive the pandemicand is now permanently closed.Today the average hotel stay in that same neighborhood costs between $400 and $500 on a Friday night.The surge in hotel prices, particularly for upmarket accommodations, hascaught the attentionof travelers and investors worldwide. What led to this spike in hotel rates post-pandemic?

Several factors have been at play for the hospitality industry since COVID entered the rearview, resulting in higher prices for travelers.

Competition within hospitality plays a crucial role in determining hotel prices.While it might appear that there's no shortage of lodging options for travelers, the regulatorycrackdownon platforms like Airbnb in big cities has redirected travelers back into the arms of traditional hotels, thereby increasing demand.

As the Consumer Choice Center haspointed out,80 percent of properties were alreadydelistedfrom Airbnb by October 2023 thanks to New York City’s stringent new short-term rental policies.Because of the new restrictions on temporary rentals, which state thatonly two paying guests at most can stay for up to 30 daysunder certain conditions (unobstructed access to the whole residence, short-term registration, owner present on site), many families have no choice but to look for a hotel room during their NYC stay.

Not to mention themassive buying upof hotel room blocks by the city in order to house newly arrived migrant populations.This warps the market for hotel rooms in profound ways. NYC has at least 140 active contracts with city hotels to fill all their vacant rooms, normally valued around $110 per night, but marked up by 73 percent to $190 for a room. Vacancies mean lower prices, but if surrounding inns are full, hotel prices rise for consumers.

This arrangement may not be what hoteliers had in mind for their business, but it has proven highly lucrative for the properties cooperating with the city in these contracts.

Closures of smaller hotels along with industryconsolidationreduce the number of options for consumers, which empowers larger hotel chains to raise prices. Moreover, high interest rates on financing discourage the construction of new hotels, leading to an even more constrained supply of rooms. All the while, prices creep even higher.

Consolidated hotel groups have found innovative ways to manage yields and hence increase revenue.This would explain higher average daily rates despite similar oreven lower occupancy ratesfor NYC hotels pre-pandemic.

Higher prices are also related to consumer preferences, which have evolved significantly in recent years. The pandemicprompted a shift towards saferand more luxurious options, with travelers prioritizing enhanced safety measures and amenities. This shift, coupled withpent-up demandfrom periods of lockdown, has resulted in a willingness among travelers to pay a premium for upmarket hotels.

Consumers alsotend to bookcloser to their travel dates and are proving reluctant to commit far in advance. A few years of uncertainty around travel has created a more cautious average traveler. On top of that, the normalization ofremote work has blurredthe lines between business and leisure travel, leading to longer average stays.

People are taking personal vacations and then staying there longer while they transition back into work mode.

Amidst all these trends, operational costs rise with minimum wage hikes, labor shortages, crunched supply chains overseas, and ever-increasing taxes in America’s largest cities. The labor shortfall is not insignificant and leaves hotels struggling to meet the high demand for rooms. The costs are likely being passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

It’s also very possible that hotels are eager torecoup losses incurredduring the pandemic period, driving them to maximize revenue through price adjustments as demand rebounds in major travel markets.

It’s a perfect storm of industry trends, regulatory pressures on competitors, and consumer behavior driving up the average price of a hotel stay in NYC and other large cities. Is there anything that can be done?

Ideally, as prices rise, consumers will see a new wave of entrepreneurial competition offering market solutions and testing out new models for lodging travelers. For the sake of all our wallets, let’s hope that happens sooner rather than later.

2024-04-26 20:20:00,Immunity For Me But Not For Thee,https://web.archive.org/web/20240427121603/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/immunity-me-not-thee#comment-stream,"Authored by William Woodruff via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

“Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office?” That is the question the Supreme Court will answer when it hears oral argument inTrump v. U.S.on April 25, 2024.

Legacy media and the ladies of “The View”nearly lost their collective mindswhen the Court agreed to hear Trump’s appealof theD.C. Circuit’s decision denying him immunityfor his actions surrounding the events of Jan. 6, 2021. However, even Jack Smith, the Special Counsel prosecuting the case, argued that it was of “imperative public importance” that the Court resolve the immunity question before trial.

But forget about Trump for the moment.The issue is bigger than Trump and his legal woes. As the partisan divide between the left and the right grows larger, there is a real risk that the criminalization of policy differences could raise our current state of “lawfare” to a new level.

Several retired four-star generals and admirals, as well as former cabinet officials, have filed anamicusbriefwith the Supreme Courtarguing that granting immunity to former presidents for actions within the outer perimeter of their official duties would raise questions about the ability of the United States to peacefully transfer power from one administration to another, and thereby pose a grave risk to national security.

The retired officials’ brief also argues that granting immunity would undermine civilian control of the military and undermine trust and confidence in the military as an institution.

The “parade of horribles” in the retired officials’ brief assumes that a future president would instruct subordinate military officers to carry out illegal orders for which they, but not the president, would be criminally liable. The brief also suggests that an unrestrained incumbent would use the military to retain power and, thus, destabilize America’s diplomatic and military standing among nations.

Of course,none of the hypotheticals feared by the brief writers occurred in the case pending before the Court. Apparently, they are afraid not of Donald Trump but of some unidentified future president.

To analyze the pros and cons of immunity, however, there is no need to speculate about what some future president might do. We need only look at actual events from our recent history.

President Obama ordered adrone strike in Yemen to kill Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen and Islamic Imam critical of American foreign policy in the Middle East. Before releasing the drones that killed al-Awlaki and two others, the White House sought and received aMemorandum from the Department of Justiceproviding legal justification for the attack.

Several questions come to mind.Should the memo from DoJ authorizing the killing of an American citizen abroad without judicial due process immunize President Obama for violating the federal criminal statute that imposes criminal penalties for theextra territorial killing of an American citizen?

Could a subsequent President, a member of the opposing political party, direct a new Attorney General to investigate whether the killing of the U.S. citizen by drone attack in Yemen violated federal criminal law? If an indictment is returned against the now former President for that killing, should President Obama be allowed to claim immunity or be forced to stand trial?

President Biden revoked many of President Trump’sExecutive Ordersaddressing border security when he took office. He also halted construction of physical barriers intended to secure the southern border and stem the flow of illegal border crossings and the smuggling of dangerous drugs.

The number ofillegal border crossings skyrocketed. Instead of remaining in Mexico until asylum claims were adjudicated, migrants were “paroled” into the interior of the United States and given a court date for their asylum claim years into the future.

The quantity of illegal drugs, and the deaths of American citizens from accidental drug overdoses smuggled across the southern border, escalated astronomically. Federal law imposes criminal penalties on those who enter the United Statesillegally. It also punishesconspiraciesto violate federal law.

So, if the White House switches parties when President Biden leaves, should the new president’s Attorney General seek an indictment against Biden for conspiring with the Secretary of Homeland Security to violate U.S. immigration laws by facilitating the illegal entry of millions of migrants into the United States? Or should those policy choices be protected by a cloak of immunity?

Eager to deliver on a campaign promise, President Biden announced a policy to “forgive” billions of dollars in student loan debt. The Supreme Courtstruck downthe President’s plan and held that Congress had not authorized the Executive to unilaterally forgive student loan debt.

Instead of seeking legislative authority, President Biden reworked his plan to rely upon a different statute for authority. Assume the courts dismissed lawsuits challenging Biden’s “Plan B” because the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue. “Plan B” went forward and billions of dollars in federal student loans became “grants” instead of loans that had to be repaid.

The federalAnti-deficiency Actimposescriminal penaltieson anyone who authorizes the expenditure of federal funds without a valid congressional appropriation. When President Biden leaves office, can he be indicted and tried because his “Plan B” loan scheme violated federal law?

Each of the foregoing situations illustrates how  a former President could be subject to indictment for actions taken within the outer perimeter of his official duties as President. Never happen, you say? Surely, no one would try to force these facts into violations of existing law. ButAlvin Bragg,Fani Willis, andJack Smithhave all engaged in creative lawyering to bring novel criminal charges against Trump. Apparently, some see creative lawyering as a feature and not a bug in our legal system.

While the former Presidents have substantive defenses to the charges and the novel theories advanced in the indictments may be rejected by the courts or nullified by a jury, should the former presidents and the country be put through the spectacle of a criminal trial?

One of the major attributes of immunity is that it avoids the trial in the first place.Instead of placing one’s fate in the hands of a jury and hoping they will accept one or more defenses or justifications for the alleged violations, immunity prevents the trial at the outset. In other words, if the process is the punishment, immunity avoids the process.

Presidential immunity for actions within the outer perimeter of official duties allows a president to make difficult policy and operational decisions without concern for his personal liberty once he leaves office. It also eliminates the temptation to exact a tit for tat when the next election goes to the opposition party.

On the flip side,the existence of presidential immunity may provide unwarranted protection for the actions and decisions of a president who does not really have the best interests of the country at heart. But the Constitution provides two significant checks on that unseemly circumstance: impeachment and the ballot box. Furthermore, the Constitution specifically provides that upon conviction by the Senate in an impeachment trial the person impeached “shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.”

It is tempting to favor or disfavor presidential immunity in criminal cases depending upon the political or personal like or dislike one may have for the indicted former President. Republicans get immunity but Democrats don’t; or vice versa.But if we are to be a nation of laws every former president should be entitled to presidential immunity for alleged criminal acts committed within the outer perimeter of official duties, or no former President should be so immune.

The issue before the Supreme Court is one of first impression. While immunity has been litigated in the context ofcivil claims, no former President has been indicted for criminal acts while in office, until now. In an ideal world, the answer to the question presented inTrump v. United Stateswould remain nothing more than an interesting topic of discussion among law professors.

But if the last seven or eight years have proved anything it is that we are not living in an ideal world.

2024-04-26 20:40:00,Drizzle Drizzle? 'Soft Guy Era' Parody Trend Sheds Light On Feminist Hypocrisy,https://web.archive.org/web/20240427121603/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/drizzle-drizzle-soft-guy-era-parody-trend-sheds-light-feminist-hypocrisy#comment-stream,"First, the feminists claimed that they ""don't need no man"" and promoted a culture of ""strong independent women,"" the idea being that men were holding women back from their true potential.  The ""patriarchy"" conspiracy was an all prevailing issue for woke activists for years, and their answer was to attack and sabotage men and masculinity with a terroristic fervor.  Masculinity, they argued, is the root of all historic evils.

However, as feminists gained the backing of governments and massive corporate financiers the idea of women being ""oppressed"" in western countries seemed even less probable than it did before.  What rights under the law do men have that women don't have?  Ask a feminist this question and she'll have no idea how to answer.  Feminism and woke movements in general rely on the image of being the underdog; a heroic revolutionary effort by people who are fighting to gain a voice.  But woke activists aren't fighting ""the man"", they are ""the man.""  You can't be a revolutionary when you're the oppressor.

In response, men started giving feminists exactly what they said they wanted:  Equal treatment.  The old days of chivalry and the expectations for men to support women financially quickly faded, and suddenly feminists discovered that men were no longer spending their cash as freely as they used to.  Everything is half-and-half today, and feminists don't like that.

So, hypocritically, the same woke promoters that once pontificated about women being treated equally took to the internet to attack men who embraced the idea.  The ""Sprinkle Sprinkle"" narrative was born, with feminists demanding that men submit to feminism while also paying for everything a woman desires as if they are walking ATMs.  Those men that don't are accused of being ""broke losers"" who don't deserve companionship.

Yes, it's bewildering, but this is the nature of Cultural Marxism - The goal of activists is to break down the target population until they are slaves to collectivist whim.  No matter what you do, no matter how you accommodate them, it's never good enough because the true purpose is control.  In the case of feminism, being a man is the same as original sin and every man must pay the price for that sin for as long as they live.  Meaning if men want access to women they can't just treat them equally, they also have to pay.

This philosophy has led to a flurry of online trends, mainly on websites like TikTok, in which feminists give women relationship advice on how to view men as an easy income source while squeezing them for every available penny.  The term ""foodie call"" became ubiquitous as social media activists laughed about having various categories of men in their roster, some for sex and some for free food.  This is where the now infamous ""Restaurant Refusal List"" came from; a list of eateries that feminists say women should never go to on a first date because they are ""cheap.""

List of restaurants women refuse to go on a first date to is going viral 👀pic.twitter.com/4myU4nsL0O

And don't think for one second that these internet fads have no bearing on the real world, because they absolutely do.  The ignorance of older generations to the online social ecosystem is one of the reasons why the woke movement seemed to strike out of nowhere a decade ago.  Everyone thought it was fringe and funny until it suddenly began dominating every element of the web and pop-culture.

The Sprinkle-Sprinkle trend blew up, with scores of women taking to TikTok to complain about how men don't fulfill their needs monetarily and proudly boasting about the privileges they're entitled to.  The double standard was now complete.  Women were all victims all the time.  Men were all victimizers all the time.  But women were also ""powerful"" and independent, yet they required men's finances to feel respected.  Meaning, under feminism men can truly never win, even if they give in.

Thankfully, grassroots counter-movements are learning and adapting to the online environment that woke activists have been thriving in, often with hilarious results.  Instead of ""Sprinkle Sprinkle"", now it's ""Drizzle Drizzle"" - The ""Soft Guy Era"" movement parodies feminist talking points, taking those arguments and flipping them around to show how ridiculous these women sound.

Men demand equal treatment, and feminists better have their cash and credit cards handy or they get no access. Men are now ""the prize.""

Obviously these are all jokes and none of the men are serious, but not surprisingly a lot of feminists are furious anyway.  As the saying goes, the left can't meme and they're incapable of laughing at themselves.

If you take, for example, common BLM arguments about white people and you flip the script by replacing the word ""white"" with the word ""black"", those same arguments come out sounding incredibly racist.  Activists don't like it when you use their methods against them.  The guys out there making Drizzle-Drizzle videos are using a similar debate technique, only with feminists.

At bottom, feminism is a narcissistic and sociopathic ideology that is destroying western relationships and the nuclear family.  It is at the core of the current downfall of civilization and should not be taken lightly.  That said, sometimes ridicule is the most effective weapon for stopping social saboteurs.  Drizzle Drizzle, kings.

UCLA medical school is under fire for forcing students to attend ‘health equity’ classes where ‘fat positivity’ is promoted, and reading material claims that the medical term ‘obesity’ is a slur “used to exact violence on fat people.”

The Washington Free Beacon obtained theentire syllabusfor the mandatory course, titledStructural Racism and Health Equity, which one medical expert who has reviewed it describes as “education designed to ideologically indoctrinate physician-activists.”

As part of the required course, all first year medical students are made to read an essay by ‘fat liberationist’Marquisele Mercedes(pictured), who uses made up terms like “fatphobia” to argue that the medical profession is biased against fat people, and that trying to lose weight to be more healthy is a “hopeless endeavor” because it is a disability that cannot be reversed.

‘Pedagogical Malpractice’: Inside UCLA Medical School’s Mandatory ‘Health Equity’ Classhttps://t.co/lucuX8hFbM

The essay titled ‘No Health, No Care: The Big Fat Loophole in the Hippocratic Oath,’ claims that weight has become “pathologized and medicalized in racialized terms,” and that fatties are discriminated against by the medical profession, particularly “Black, disabled, trans, poor fat people.”

The syllabus states that the essay provides guidance on“resisting entrenched fat oppression.”

WFB writer Aaron Sibarium breaks down the syllabus, which is replete with extreme Marxist, gender ideology, and critical race theory positions, in this thread (click through to read):

NEW: UCLA medical school's mandatory health equity class teaches students that weight loss is a ""hopeless endeavor"" and that ""ob*sity"" is a slur ""used to exact violence on fat people.""The full syllabus has shocked prominent doctors—the former dean of Harvard Medical School.🧵

The findings have been slammed by Jeffrey Flier, former dean of Harvard Medical School, who warned that the curriculum “promotes extensive and dangerous misinformation.”

Flier charges that UCLA “has centered this required course on a socialist/Marxist ideology that is totally inappropriate,” adding that “As a longstanding medical educator, I found this course truly shocking.”

“This is a profoundly misguided view of obesity, a complex medical disorder with major adverse health consequences for all racial and ethnic groups,” Flier further urged, adding that indoctrinating medical students with such “ignorant” notions constitutes “malpractice.”

Earlier this month, UCLA’s ‘Structural Racism’ course also mandated first-year medical students to sit through acrackpot lecture by a screaming masked up pro-Hamas activistwho told them pray to ‘mama Earth’.

The Washington Free Beacon reported that when one student refused to participate, a faculty member “inquired about the student’s identity, implying that discipline could be on the table.”

UCLA Med School Requires Students To Attend Lecture Where Speaker Demands Prayer for ‘Mama Earth,’ Leads Chants of ‘Free Palestine.’https://t.co/P0d9MD2brJpic.twitter.com/6IwQ8V62Z3

The course also prompted a civil rights complaint back in January after students were separated into race-based discussion groups, with one for white students, another for African Americans, and a third for “Non-Black People of Color.”

It was only when a Wall Street Journaleditorialpublicised the complaint, that UCLA moved to cancel the exercise.

Last month, The Daily Wire alsopublished portionsof the course’s openly socialist syllabus,including unitson “settler colonialism” where students were made to read anessaytitledDecolonization Is Not A Metaphorthat describes the “epistemic, ontological, cosmological violence” of “the settler.”

2/ These emails come from a mandatory class called ""Structural Racism and Health Equity."" UCLA med students are told to read about wars of “Indigenous resistance” – in which Native Americans killed thousands of white people – to “imagine what liberation could look like.""pic.twitter.com/0E9RWS7C5w

4/ The emails from this first-year class also reveal that students are encouraged to listen to a podcast entitled ""Indigenae,"" which covers an array of unscientific nonsense, including people identifying as ""two-spirit"" and ""womxn.""pic.twitter.com/0Y8tRh1VqV

6/ In the context of a medical school, these materials aren't just irrelevant -- they put lives at risk. Medical students are being taught to disregard science, and instead to build resentment towards many of their patients.

This is all just the tip of the iceberg as far as DEI on college campuses goes. Yale, Stanford and Columbia all have similar programs in place, to name just three institutions.

Imagine the fallout of this when today’s students become part of the fabric of the workforce and government of the country.

2024-04-26 21:20:00,Pentagon Chief Trolls Iran On Effectiveness Of Weapons After Israel Attack,https://web.archive.org/web/20240427121603/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/pentagon-chief-trolls-iran-effectiveness-weapons-after-israel-attack#comment-stream,"US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday weighed in on the April 13 Iranian attack on Israel, which was the Islamic Republic's first-ever direct attack on the Jewish state.

It included some 300 drones and missiles launched at Israel - the vast majority of which were intercepted by Israeli anti-air defenses, but also with US and Western help, and the deployment of warplanes which shot inbound drones out of the sky. Austin in a press briefing appeared tomock the Iranian attack as weak and ineffective. This comes following Tehran officials deriding Israel's apparent 'limited' retaliation which came on April 19.

""They should be questioning the effectiveness of their weapons systems and their planning,""Austintold reportersin reference to the Iranians and their military.

""Hopefully they don’t walk away from this over-confident that they can do this at will, becauseI think Israel has demonstrated that it has a significant ability to defend itself,"" Austin added.

While it's clear that some of Iran's ballistic missiles did hit a couple of Israeli airbases in the central and south of the country, many more were intercepted or fell harmlessly in the desert.

A fresh report in Jerusalem Post notes that people are still randomly finding nearly intact missiles in theNegev desert:

...the missiles launched towards Nevatim and other targets in the Negev fell in the South but far from the targets they were aimed at. When they arelying in the Negev devoid of the warheads, they are just metal scraps, which the IDF slowly collects for research and analysis of the enemy's capabilities.

Travelers who were walking in the Arad area of the Judean desert, enjoying the starry night, were surprised to find themselves standing next to a ballistic missile, a remnant of the major attack thatTehran launched against Israel,which included more than 300 suicide drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles.

This is not the first missile discovered in the south since the attack.Similar missiles were discovered nearby in the Dead Sea area immediately after.

Below via Reuters/JPost: A man stands next to the apparent remains of a ballistic missile, as it lies in the desert near the Dead Sea, following a massive missile and drone attack by Iran on Israel, in southern Israel April 21, 2024

Despite Austin's criticisms and mockery aimed at Tehran, the Biden administration is breathing a sigh of relief that the whole thing ended in a one-off tit-for-tat which subsided after each side got its strikes in, and not runaway escalation leading to major war. Both sides telegraphed their responses and limited them, in order to ensure the likelihood of avoiding a bigger regional war.

2024-04-26 22:00:00,Worst In 70 Years: Biden Approval Rating Absolutely Dismal,https://web.archive.org/web/20240427121603/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/worst-70-years-biden-approval-rating-absolutely-dismal#comment-stream,"President Joe Biden has theworst job approval rating since Eisenhowerduring his recently completed 13th quarter in office, according to a new poll by Gallup.

While Biden clocks in at 38.7%, the previous low was set by George H.W. Bush at 41.8% in 1992. Donald Trump and Barack Obama averaged 46.8% and 45.9% respectively during the same point in their presidencies. Prior to Bush, Jimmy Carter is the only other president with a sub-50% average in his 13th quarter.

Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush averaged between 51% and 55% approval in their 13th quarters, while Dwight Eisenhower had the highest average for a president during his 13th month at 73.2%.

What's more,Biden's most recent approval rating places him 277 out of 314 presidential quartersin Gallup history dating back to 1945, placing him in thebottom 12% of all presidential quarters. Biden's score is technically the lowest of his presidency, which has been dragging in the low 40% range since Q4 of his term.

This union worker says what much of America is thinking right now…..😂🙌🏼🇺🇸pic.twitter.com/b4BOEchMBh

By political affiliation, Gallup's poll found that2% of Republicans approve of Biden's job in office, while independents have him at 33%. The vast majority of Democrats, 83%, think Biden's doing an awesome job.

MeanwhileanAxios'vibes survey' / Harris poll found that most Americans want mass deportations,including 42% of Democrats.

The poll also found that30% of Democrats and 46% of Republicans say they'd end birthright citizenshipguaranteed under the 14th Amendment.

AsAxiosnotes further:

Americans are open to former President Trump'sharshest immigration plans, spurred on by a record surge of illegal border crossings and a relentless messaging war waged by Republicans.

""I was surprised at the public support for large-scale deportations,"" said Mark Penn, chairman of The Harris Poll and a former pollster for President Clinton, adding ""I think they're just sending a message to politicians: 'Get this under control,'"" suggesting that this is aclear warning to Biden that ""efforts to shift responsibility for the issue to Trump are not going to work.""

Drilling down, when asked to identify their greatest concern surrounding illegal immigration, Americans most frequently cited:

The survey also found that64% of those polled believe immigrants receive more in welfare and benefits than they pay in taxes, and 54% believe that immigration is linked to spiking US crime rates, which Axios refutes.

Bottom line: ""The tradeoff here in the poll is,people would take expanded legal immigration if they saw there's a crackdown on the border,"" according to Penn.

2024-04-26 22:20:00,"Competition, The American Way",https://web.archive.org/web/20240427121603/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/competition-american-way,"Authored by Jack Miller via RealClearEducation,

Our K-12 educational system is designed to serve much less than 50% of American students.

For decades the cry has been that “all kids must go to college.” Yet, only aminority do so and fewer graduate.

Our high schools have been turned into college prep schools. Shop classes have been eliminated, along with other useful courses. Most students who don’t go to college have been deprived of the education they need to be successful. And businesses looking for hungry, well-prepared personnel have been deprived of good candidates.

A2022 reportfrom American Compass suggests that “for every young American on the idealized path, there are ten who never enroll in college or else fail to complete a degree.” Various studies show different percentages, but all show that most students don’t complete, or even enter, college. Studies also show that fewer young people are even applying to college.

This is a real, self-imposed crisis. It also has a major impact on many of those in poorer circumstances or who get bored with college prep courses and drop out of school before graduating.

Given this well-documented reality, why has our K-12 education system not reformed itself to address this glaring problem?

Once you understand the problem, it is not difficult to figure out how to fix it. In the K-8 system, every student should be taught the basics: reading, writing, and arithmetic, plus some civics and history to start them on the road to being good citizens.

When students get to high school, they should be offered a two-track program.Keep the college prep program going for those who want to go on to postsecondary education. Also, another track should be introduced for the majority who don’t plan to go to college.

In addition to the basics such as English, history, civics, and a few others, students should have the option to take various kinds of vocation-based classes that teach the skills that are needed in the job market. We should be preparing all our young people to be good citizens, but also for good-paying jobs that don’t require a college degree.

Then,we need to strengthen our trade schools, the community college system, and internships, which would further prepare these young people to be successful in their careers. During the four to six years others are spending in college, young adults who take this track would be able to work and earn money instead of accumulating debt. In many cases they could make as much, or even more, than many college graduates.

The benefits of creating a two-track system would be immense. First, we could expand our labor pool quite a bit. Our country is facing a labor shortage. The birth rate has been down for a number of years, so fewer young people are entering the workforce, and an increasing number of people are retiring. Our immigration policies are not allowing enough skilled labor into the country.

The answer to these problems is to tap into thatlarge, untrained, unmotivated pool of talent our schools are leaving behind. Doing so would have many benefits, both for the individuals and for the country.

For the individuals, it would provide them with a good middle-class, or higher, lifestyle. It would give them a sense of pride, of accomplishment. It would keep many of them from committing crimes and staying out of jail, and it would lead to much happier lives.

For the country, it would provide a large pool of trained workers. It would add to our gross national product. It would reduce the amount of money we spend on law enforcement and incarceration. It would prevent the enormous waste that results from theft and other crimes.

For a great many jobs, a two-year certificate from a community college or additional trade school training is all that may be needed to get a good start in a career.And, from there, meritocracy determines the rest.

This project should be taken on by the states. Education is a state responsibility and should not wait for the federal government to shoulder this responsibility. The fastest, most efficient method is for the states to act now.

Of course, those states that do act would be creating the best-trained workforces and would be growing their economies and attracting businesses. A little competition, the American way, is always a good thing.

Baltimore County Police Chief Robert McCullough toldreportershis investigators worked with FBI agents and experts from the University of California at Berkeley to determine that a recording of Pikesville High School principal Eric Eiswert, circulating on social media since January, was generated with AI tools by Dazhon Darien, the school's athletic director, to retaliate against the principal for not renewing his work contract and an investigation into the mishandling of school funds.

On Thursday, McCullough said his investigation found that""Dazhon Darien, the school's athletic director, produced the recording to retaliate against Principal Eiswert, who had initiated a probe into the mishandling of school funds.""

Local media outlet WBFF's investigative i-Team arm,Project Baltimore, originally obtained the audio recording, which is 41 seconds long, beginning with racially charged language about black students.

""I seriously don't understand why I have to constantly put up with these dumb***** here every day,""the AI impersonated voice of the principle said, adding,

""Between these ungrateful black kids who can't test their way out of a paper bag or these teachers who don't get it. How hard is it to get these students to meet their grade level expectations?""

On Thursday morning, Darien was arrested 30 miles south at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport on an outstanding warrant. ABC 13 News said he now faces charges that include stalking, disruption of school operations, and retaliation against a witness. He's being held in custody on a $5,000 bond.

The principal was removed from his position as the investigation played out. BCPS officials said he would not return for the remainder of the school year.

Eiswert denied responsibility for the audio during the multi-month investigation, telling police Darien was the culprit.

According to charging documents, Darien's attempt to sabotage the principal with AI was motivated by ""his contract not being renewed next semester due to frequent work performance challenges"" and the unauthorized use of school funds.

Just wait until AI is weaponized against a politician or presidential candidate. It's coming.

A San Diego County official has branded the city the “new epicenter” for illegal immigration and claimed that Border Patrol has become “the ‘Uber’ for migrants” entering the county.

“San Diego is the new epicenter for migrants and illegal immigration,”San Diego District 5 Supervisor Jim Desmondpostedon the social media platform X on April 25.

“The surge in illegal crossings has propelled San Diego to the unfortunate position of leading all nine southern border sectors in April, a trend unseen since the 1990s.”

On Wednesday alone, Border Patrol apprehended 2,000 illegal immigrants within the San Diego sector, according to Mr. Desmond. Among them were 206 Chinese nationals, he said.

Since Oct. 1st, there have been nearly 215,000 apprehensions representing individuals from 75 different countries in the San Diego sector, Mr. Desmond wrote in the post.

“Moreover, the closure of the processing center has led to over 30,000 migrant drop-offs in the past two months alone, with projections of more than 1,000 drop-offs expected today,”he continued.

“This doesn’t account for the frequent occurrences of boats washing ashore, averaging three to four incidents weekly. ”

Mr. Desmond appeared to be referencing the $6 million Migrant Welcome Center that shut down in San Diego in February due to a lack of funding.

The District 5 supervisor went on to state that human smugglers have identified California—and in particular the San Diego border sector—as “the path of least resistance” for illegal immigrants.

“Border Patrol has inadvertently become the ‘Uber’ for migrants entering San Diego County, and the County is the travel agent,”he concluded.

Speaking toNewsnationlater on April 25, Mr. Desmond claimed that people are “just walking across the border” and Border Patrol agents “are not empowered to stop them.”

“All they’re doing is processing them once they ... walk across the border,”he told the publication.

The Epoch Times has reached out to San Diego Border Patrol for further comment.

Mr. Desmond’s comments come after he and other San Diego County leaders called on the state and federal governments to bolster security at the border and remove sanctuary city policies amid the ongoing immigration crisis.

Speaking at apress conferencealongside several mayors on April 15 near Carlsbad State Beach, Mr. Desmond said more than 125,000 illegal immigrants have entered since September, of which more than 25,000 had been released onto the streets in the past two months.

The county official stressed those figures did not include known “gotaways,” those known to have entered the country illegally while evading Border Patrol.

He further blamed California’s sanctuary city policies for prohibiting law enforcement agencies from working with Immigration Customs and Enforcement to hand over illegal immigrants, even if they are identified as suspects in crimes other than entering the United States illegally.

Mr. Desmond criticized the state for providing “free health care to illegal immigrants,” along with “free legal defense to those here illegally seeking asylum ... no matter what crime they commit.”

He and other Republican county officials, including Carlsbad Mayor Keith Blackburn, Vista Mayor John Franklin, and San Marcos Mayor Rebecca Jones, called upon the state of California and the federal government to do more to address the influx of illegal immigrants while calling for harsher penalties on human smugglers.

“We need to make major changes for the safety of our people, the safety of all of San Diego County,”Mr. Desmond said. “We need the state and federal officials to bring more resources, whether it’s more Coast Guard or National Guard ... We’ve got to come together and allow law enforcement to communicate with ICE. We need to be able to deport criminals out of the country.”

In contrast, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has defended the state’s response to the ongoing immigration crisis while praising the Biden administration for providing millions in federal grants to address the issue.

“Let’s be clear: President Biden is doing all he can to fund border security and humanitarian efforts while Republicans in Congress are choosing border chaos for political gain,”he said in an April 12 statement.

The Democrat went on to accuse congressional Republicans of trying to “undermine opportunities to advance border security” and modernize the immigration system for political gain.

“The Newsom Administration is working in partnership with the Biden-Harris Administration and California Congressional leaders, along with state and local officials, to advocate for federal funding for communities as they support the federal government with a safe and orderly process, further enhancing border security,” the governor said.

Earlier this month the White House published its new“Pandemic Preparedness” targets.

They are far from alone in covering this. Back in March,Sky News was asking:“Next pandemic is around the corner,’ expert warns – but would lockdown ever happen again?”

On April 3rd, the Financial Times askedsomething similar:“The next pandemic is coming. Will we be ready?”

Less than an hour ago,the Daily Mailinvited us inside“the world’s deadliest cave that could cause the next pandemic”.

Just two days ago a professional panic spreaderwrote for CNN:

The next pandemic threat demands action now!!!

OK, I added the exclamation points, but they are very much implied in the original text.

So, while Iran and Israel rattle their sabres on the front pages, I thought we should take a look at the quieter back pages to see what we can learn, and help us predict how “the next pandemic” will unfold.

I mean…I feel like that’s fairly self-explanatory.

Seriously though, it’s the onethey’ve been predictingfrom pretty much the moment Covid started. First it was going to bemonkey pox– sorry MPox – but that fizzled.

Of course by “pandemic”, wereallymean “psy-op”, because nothing about thenextpandemic will be any more real than thelastpandemic. Hell, given the leaps forward in AI technology, it could be considerablyless realnext time.

We don’t know any of the details yet, but there’s enough vague coverage to tease out some guesstimates.

Probably the most important question. We already mentioned monkey pox, but that doesn’t look likely anymore.

Right now they are mostlytalking about “disease X”– a term which caused a little panic in certain sections when it first appeared on the scene – but that isn’t some top secret gain of function super disease, it’s literally a place holder name.

And it’s a placeholder name which does its job, for the time being.

After all, they don’t reallyneedan actual name yet, any more than they need an actual disease, they just need the idea of a disease to hold over people’s heads while they construct the legislative rules of their health-based tyranny.

Indeed, the vagueness “Disease X” provides is helpful, as it keeps the legislation vague too.

That said, they will likely want and/or need to produce an actual disease at some point.

When that time comes around, it will almost certainly be another respiratory disease, because they are easy to “fake” using pre-existing endemic diseases and their uniform symptoms.

The prime candidate is bird flu, which has been slow-boiling in the news fortwo yearsnow and has recently got a big uptick in coverage due to it allegedly passing to people from cows.

The UN reports“pandemic experts” are“concerned over avian influenza spread to humans”. Just yesterday, Jeremy Farrar of the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that“[the] threat Of Bird Flu spreading to Humans is a great concern”

Prompting gleefully sensationalist headlineslike thisfrom the Daily Star:

New pandemic ‘expected’ as human-to-human bird flu of ‘great concern’ to WHO

Bird flu is a convenient pick because it enables them to push their health tyranny and their food transition at the same time. They can claim that dairy, beef, chicken and eggs have become “dangerous” as an excuse to ration them or at least force scarcity while they drive the prices up.

They will then push the idea that veganism and/or lab grown meat “prevents pandemics”. Something they’ve beenclaiming since at least 2021.

The Daily Mail reportedjust a few hours ago:

H5N1 strain of bird flu is found in MILK for first time in ‘very high concentrations,’ World Health Organization warns

The downside to bird flu is that it’s hard to workthe climate change angleinto the narrative, so maybe they’ll go with something else.

Probably not until the winter, I would guess January 2025 at the earliest, for two reasons:

That second point is not just a hunch, but based on the article from Sky I mentioned above. It asks“would lockdown ever happen again?”, and an “expert” answers [emphasis added]:

…if another lockdown was needed, the current Tory government would either have to minimise scandals over their own rule-breaking – or change hands completely to keep the public on board.If we had a new government, people would be far more likely to have faith in thembecause they would be less likely to say, ‘it’s the same bunch as before – why should we do it again?’

Which I think is correct.

That would also explain the raft of sudden political resignations – including Covid stars Angela Merkel and Jacinda Ardern – which swept the world in Covid’s wake. They were aware then, and are still aware now, their players were spent and they needed a fresh roster before coming back for the second leg.

So, elections first – with all the nonsense that entails –thenmaybe the “next pandemic”.

Any future pandemic psy-op will be unlikely to follow the covid pattern beat-for-beat, for one thing the Covid narrative spent itself before achieving everything it was meant to achieve.

You can bet the farm that, in the four years since, there have been working groups and researchers poring over the pandemic data to figure out what went wrong and how they can fix it next time.

There seem to be three recurring themes.

1. Vaccines not lockdownsThere will be a focus on securing vaccines rather than lockdowns. Indeed, part of the whole “aw shucks lockdowns were damaging who’d have thunk it” rigmarole is about setting up the dynamic that “next time” we need to do anything we can toavoidlockdowns.

Lockdowns will become a threat rather than a fact.

“We HAVE to mandate vaccines, because the economy can’t afford another lockdown.”

“Take the vaccine, you don’t want to have another lockdown do you?”

So there will be more testing, more masks and more vaccine mandates…and/or quarantine camps for the unvaccinated. And if they DO have lockdowns, they will be entirely blamed on the “anti-vaxxers”, of course.

2. Speed speed speedThe main failing of the Covid narrative was that it ran out of steam. By the time the vaccines rolled out in early 2021 the pandemic fatigue was already setting in. And by the time the third boosters and fourth waves were in the headlines nobody really cared.

The propaganda blitzkrieg of early 2020 was arguably the greatest and most wide-reaching misinformation campaign of all time – and it was almost overwhelmingly effective. But it slowed, stalled, stopped and staled.

Next time, they know now, they need to befaster. Bill Gatessaid as muchat the 2022 Munich Security Conference. They need to get the disease out the deaths up and vaccines in before people even realise what happened.

Hence the “100 day vaccines” plan. As the ever-reliably-hysterical Devi Shridarwrites for the Guardian:

most governments are working towards the 100-day challenge: that is, how to contain a virus spreading while a scientific response, such as a vaccine, diagnostic or treatment, can be approved, manufactured and delivered to the public.

The “100 Day Mission” is the brainchild ofCEPI, the Gates and WHO-backed NGO. Its main aim is to make it possible to produce new vaccines for previously unknown pathogens in 100 days.

In the US,the target is 130 daysfrom pathogen discovery to nation-wide vaccine coverage."

In an exclusive interview with Remix News, Dutch political commentator and lawyer Eva Vlaardingerbroek warns Europeans that they must take a stand against rapid demographic change or become a minority in their native countries.

You’ve spoken a lot about White rights and the White replacement. But of course this kind of opens you up to these accusations of racism. So, how do conservatives deal with this Catch-22 of not wanting to be replaced in their native countries, but also not wanting to be attacked with this term?

You can’t. That’s the thing, you can’t. So you have to pick a side. Of course, you’re going to be attacked if you say, “Hey, this continent, Europe, has been predominantly White for the entirety of its history, and now suddenly within one generation, a few bureaucrats have decided against the will of the people that we should suddenly be a minority. Why do we agree with that, or why do we allow that to happen?” If you say that, you are going to be attacked.

But the only other option then you have is saying nothing and have it happen, so the choice is yours, and I’ve made my choice. I think there are many ways in which you can defend yourself, of course, against this ridiculous attack, so I’m sure that they’re going say about me that I’m a terrible racist again. No, that’s not true. I don’t think that any race is superior to another. I just think that mine is also not inferior to that of others.

🚨 EXC: ""The choice is yours and I've made mine!""@EvaVlaartells Remix News she has accepted she will be attacked by the establishment for calling out attempts to make indigenous White Europeans a minority on their own continent.#CPACHungary2024pic.twitter.com/faAE298zv3

So, I don’t have to be pointed at as the root of all evil, as the Neo-Marxist critical race theory does. I don’t have to become a minority in my own country, as Joe Biden said would be “a good thing,” would be “our strength.” No, why actually? Who was the racist here? Explain to me why we don’t have the right to exist, why we’re not allowed to be a majority in the continent, in the countries that we have been a majority in since forever? Explain it to me. Turn the question around.

A lot of right-wing parties here are willing to talk about illegal immigration, but unwilling to address legal immigration. Some conservative parties even promote legal immigration. What do you think about this development?Well, the problem is of course that if you have tons of illegal immigration, and then you slap the label “legal” on it, then nothing changes. So that’s something that we’ve seen in the past few years that illegal immigration has been made legal in a way, so it’s been made really easy for certain people to come to Europe and also not so easy for others to go through the regular system. I think this problem exists in America to a certain degree as well, that it’s quite hard to immigrate legally to the United States, but illegally it’s not so difficult across the Mexican border.

So, if you look at the problem of immigration, I think you have to look also at demographic change. That’s why I took this dance today on stage. We have to look at the reality rather than the term that they put on immigration. Do we agree with what’s happening here, with what is happening with this rapid change in our demographic makeup? If the answer is no, then something needs to change. It’s as simple as that.

🇳🇱‼️@EvaVlaar: ""If we don't start to fight for our continent, the time in which we live will go down in history as the time Western nations didn't need to be invaded to be conquered. Our corrupt elite invited the invaders in!""#CPACHungary2024pic.twitter.com/DmtQcXbFoU

You converted to Catholicism approximately a year ago. How has your Catholicism influenced your politics, if at all?

It has influenced my politics in the sense that my faith has become such a huge part of my life, that even more so than before, I feel like it would be completely disingenuous and wrong for me to exclude my faith from my political messaging. So, as it has such a massive influence on me as a person, I think it’s noticeable to people that I let it seep through a lot more in my speeches and in my discourse than maybe I did before. So, it just inspires my ideas and my ability to go on stage. I pray to God before I go on stage, that is something that I didn’t use to do a few years ago, but it immediately calms me just asking God for guidance and help, you know, to give me the strength to do his will on stage.

What do you think about the fact that most Northern European right-wing parties are shying away from religious messages in their party platform? The AfD, Sweden, Democrats, a lot of Dutch parties keep it in the background, perhaps because people are leaving the church, and many young people are leaving the church. So, how do conservatives reach young people in Northern Europe while maintaining their convictions?

I think it’s a big mistake to leave religion and to leave the Christian faith out of your political messaging, especially if you want to reach the youth. I think that we’ve been brainwashed to believe that if we preach the Gospel, if we call upon our Lord during our speeches, if we speak proudly and openly about the fact that we’re Christians, that we’re then going to scare away the youth. I think the opposite is actually true.

I think there is a moral vacuum that’s either going to be filled with climate insanity or woke nonsense or some other subversive left-wing ideology, or it’s going to be filled with the Holy Spirit. So, you have two choices, and I think that people are looking for truth. People are looking for answers and the best gift that you can give someone is to point them in the direction of the truth rather than to dance around it and sugarcoat it, which I think is what we’ve been doing in Northwestern Europe for a long time and look where it got us.

Bye Bye, Workers"": Can Europe Slow The Impact Of Its Aging Society",https://web.archive.org/web/20240427121603/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/bye-bye-babies-bye-bye-workers-can-europe-slow-impact-its-aging-society#comment-stream,"By Erik-Jan van Harn and Maartje Wijffelaars of Rabobank

Change is often accompanied by difficulty and discomfort. Most of us are focused on the transitions that are most visible to us: the energy transition, a changing world order, or technological progress. However, there exists another, less conspicuous transition: that of demographics. Over the past six decades, fertility rates have plummeted, while life expectancy has surged to unprecedented levels. These shifts have fundamentally altered Europe’s demographic landscape and, consequently, its workforce.

Although Europe isn’t unique in this matter, it faces a pressing demographic challenge. Despite government efforts to boost fertility rates, progress remains limited. Cultural, sociological, and economic factors stubbornly outweigh incentives offered by governments. As we grapple with this persistent issue, what can we expect?

In this report, we delve into three key questions:

The labor market has been significantly strong in recent years. Unemployment rates have reached historic lows and more people have entered the workforce. But as we assess the current landscape, Europe’s long-term demographic prospects appear less than optimistic.

Demographics are shifting across the continent, although the impact on labor supply varies across countries. While some nations, like France, are projected to experience relatively benign demographic effects, others – such as Germany and Italy – face a less rosy outlook. For Germany, the annual labor contribution to economic growth is projected to average around -0.5% until 2035, due to the departure of baby boomers and Generation X from the workforce (see figure 4). In Italy, the challenge persists after 2035, as fertility rates and net migration are expected to remain lower than in Germany.

Spain and the Netherlands find themselves in an intermediate position. They also grapple with an aging population and its implications for the economy, but less so than Italy and Germany in the coming two decades. In both Spain and the Netherlands, it will take until 2030 before labor supply – in hours – will start to contract. But whereas labor’s annual negative contribution will remain very small for the Netherlands, it is set to grow for Spain as time progresses.

Age is just a number, but numbers do matter

Over the past decade, a growing supply of labor has played a pivotal role in driving economic growth, especially given the relatively modest productivity gains. Any decline in or negative impact on labor’s contribution could significantly impede overall economic growth. While weaker growth in the short-term may not pose an immediate crisis, sustained challenges could emerge with respect to public services, debt sustainability, and Europe’s strategic autonomy.

Public services and pensions

As demographic projections unfold, the number of workers available declines, and the balance between retirees and active workers shifts. Currently, there is about one retiree for every three workers in the Eurozone, but this is projected to decline to two workers by 2040. This change could strain the affordability of public services. For instance, healthcare costs are expected to rise as the population ages (see figure 6), while tax revenues may stagnate or grow at a slower pace. Another concerning issue is the sustainability of pension systems. Across most European countries, pensions operate on a pay-as-you-go model, where retirees’ benefits are funded by the contributions of the currently employed. In theory, this system functions smoothly. But as the proportion of retirees increases relative to the workforce, the burden on today’s contributors becomes substantial.

Some countries have included automatic changes to the contribution, benefits, or statutory retirement age to alleviate some of the strain on public finances when needed. In the Netherlands and Italy, for example, the statutory retirement age is linked to life expectancy. While these measures dampen the blow to some extent, the burden for public finances will likely remain large and is still projected to grow in multiple countries. This burden is especially problematic if wide access to early retirement lowers the effective retirement age, as is the case in Italy.

The Netherlands stands out from its European counterparts. Approximately half of its pension entitlements are privately funded, offering a unique approach to addressing this challenge

Debt sustainability and strategic autonomy

An aging society also poses challenges to public debt sustainability. Without substantial increases in productivity growth, we can expect a slowdown in economic growth and, consequently, a decrease in tax revenues. Simultaneously, expenditures on healthcare and pensions will rise, as illustrated in Figure 6. These trends, all else being equal, will lead to a rise in the primary budget deficit and a decrease in the affordability of debt, measured by the ratio of interest payments to revenues. A growing part of revenues will be allocated to servicing interest costs on existing debt. Corrective spending in other areas and/or tax measures will likely be necessary to prevent the overall budget balance from spiralling out of control, which would simultaneously raise financing needs and public debt. Higher productivity growth may lessen the need for austerity, as it would generate higher tax revenues with the same amount of labor, but that’s not a given. It is certain, however, that higher productivity growth makes higher taxes less painful. Furthermore, productivity and efficiency gains in the health sector could dampen the increase in healthcare spending. As such, faster productivity growth could actually be crucial to prevent a negative downward spiral between austerity measures and growth in some countries.

The demographic decline will also have implications for the geopolitical aspirations of the European Union. Firstly, it will directly impact the deterioration of debt sustainability just when the EU's strategic agenda requires substantial investments in military capabilities, the energy transition, and industrial development. Beyond the direct effects on debt servicing capacity, the demographic decline in Europe will also result in a shift in the EU's relative geopolitical power. The EU currently boasts the world's largest single market, and companies conform to EU product standards as a consequence. Therefore, the EU holds a position as a regulatory superpower. However, as Europe's consumer market shrinks in the coming decades, likely so will the power derived from it. This obviously also holds for the other forms of soft power that Europe (still) commands, such as its cultural and democratic values.

The good news for the EU with respect to its relative power on the world stage is that Europe’s problems aren’t unique and that low fertility rates and aging societies are prevalent in many countries worldwide. For instance, if current trends continue, China’s population is expected to halve in the coming decades. These long term projections are inherently uncertain, but it’s easy to argue that the demographic situation is even worse in China than it is in Europe. In addition to lower fertility rates, China also suffers from emigration. On the other hand, the United States experiences a relatively higher influx of migrants and notably higher fertility rates than Europe. With respect to demographics, the United States have the advantage.

The future doesn’t look too rosy for some countries, but luckily, the changes are predictable and relatively slow. This leaves room for policy intervention. But what can governments do to avert or at least slow the projected decline in labor supply (in hours)? In broad terms, three key factors shape the total labor supply within an economy: the working age population, the participation rate, and the hours worked per worker.

Working age population

First, we consider the working-age population. In the long term, the primary drivers are the fertility rate and net migration. Recent campaigns in countries such as Denmark, Italy, and China have underscored the challenge of increasing fertility rates. You simply cannot force people to have babies and decisions are determined by multiple factors including nature, culture, and economics. Even if successful, the effects of such campaigns may take up to two decades to materialize.

Migration represents another avenue to bolster the working-age population. Spain is a good example of a country where migration mitigates the effect of an aging population. However, this path is not without hurdles. Populist sentiments in some countries have made foreign workers less welcome. Furthermore, to fully counteract the decline in the working-age population, a substantial influx of migrants would be necessary. For Germany, this could mean accommodating between 200,000 and 400,000 workers annually over the coming decades. It is no given that European countries will be able to find qualified workers abroad so easily, as language and cultural barriers further complicate things.

An alternative approach involves redefining the concept of “working age” by raising the statutory retirement age. France, for instance, elevated its retirement age from 62 to 64 last year. While this strategy proves highly effective, recent experience also highlights the contentious nature of such adjustments. French President Emmanuel Macron had to water down his initial proposal to raise the retirement age to 65, when nationwide protests crippled the country. In Italy, a 2011 pension reform linked the retirement age to life expectancy, leading to a statutory retirement age of 67 as of 2019. Yet the age at which workers actually retire is quite some years earlier, as subsequent governments have opened a door to early retirement.

What if we could harness a larger share of our working-age population, i.e. raise the participation rate? The truth is that for most large member states, there appears to be limited room for improvement, as participation rates are high and relatively comparable. Italy is a notable outlier, however. Coincidentally, Italy also faces significant challenges. The key lies in the participation of Italian women in the labor force. Where the participation rate for Italian men closely mirrors that of other major European economies, the participation rate for Italian women is much lower. The gap in the participation rate between men and women is around 10% for most European countries, but for Italy it’s more than double that figure. If Italy can encourage more women to join the workforce, it may partially mitigate the pressing issue of its declining working age population.

What if workers simply worked more? In comparison to Asia or North America, Europeans are often both ridiculed and envied for their extended summer holidays and nine-to-five work mentality. While there is some truth to this perception, significant variations exist within the Eurozone.

Consider Greece, where workers log an average of over 1,900 hours per year – approximately 8% more than their counterparts in the United States. Conversely, in Germany for example, employees annually work around 500 hours less than in Greece. However, convincing European workers to increase their hours isn’t easy, as the trend currently leans in the opposite direction – though Italy has bucked that trend since the pandemic. While composition effects of the workforce play a role, there also appears to be a structural shift in Europeans’ work-life balance. If anything, the tightness of the labor market and historically low share of people wanting to work more hours than they do, suggests it is more an issue of supply rather than demand. So encouraging Europeans to work more hours will require robust incentives. Governments are exploring how to reverse the current trend, but haven’t had much success yet.

Thankfully, the demographic changes unfolding across Europe are both predictable and quantifiable. This foresight grants governments a crucial window of opportunity to take action before challenges escalate. Our analysis has delved into the three factors determining the labor supply: working-age population, participation rates, and average hours worked per worker. To assess what can be done, we tune each variable separately. While isolating these effects may be unrealistic, it does clearly show which areas countries can improve in.

Increase the statutory retirement age

Let’s look at the impact of changes to the working-age population. Raising the retirement age will certainly not be a popular measure. Yet given Europe’s current political climate, it might be more feasible than significantly increasing net migration. We’ve raised the statutory retirement age to 68 by 2034 across all countries in this exercise.

This adjustment would particularly benefit Italy and France. While Italy boasts a relatively high statutory retirement age (67 years  and 3 months), only a fraction of Italians work until that age due to early retirement provisions. Given the size of this cohort, a higher actual retirement age could make an impact, but would still fall short in fully reversing the demographic challenges.

France stands in a different position. The country would largely benefit from the fact that its current retirement age falls well below 68, and its relatively positive demographic prospects could further improve.

For the Netherlands, Germany, and Spain, the effect is more modest. These countries already maintain higher participation rates for the specific age cohort compared to others. Unsurprisingly, adjusting the retirement age alone won’t fully counteract the demographic decline in Germany either.

Increase the participation rate

Another approach worth considering is boosting labor participation rates. Our analysis assumes a gradual improvement in the participation rate for the working-age population, aiming for an ambitious target of 85%, which is in line with the participation rate in the Netherlands.

As anticipated, this adjustment would yield remarkable results for Italy. The participation rate is projected to surge by over 20%-points (or more than 30% in relative terms), providing a much-needed boost. Remarkably, this increase could even reverse the anticipated decline in the labor supply, fostering growth. Spain would also benefit, albeit to a lesser extent. Since we raised the participation rate to the Dutch level, there’s no impact for the Netherlands. But of course, and in contrast to the statutory retirement age, governments cannot simply “press a button” to raise the activity rate. It may require a host of measures and incentives that work both on the demand and supply side of the labor market.

Increase the average hours worked

During the pandemic, average hours worked per worker in the Eurozone experienced a significant decline and in many countries, they haven’t returned to pre-pandemic levels. In some countries, the decline follows a trend that already started (long) before the pandemic. In others, a clear intensification or “new” trend is visible. In our scenario, we assume that average hours worked rises to 1800, just above the average hours worked in Italy.

The impact would be most pronounced in Western Europe, where workers currently log fewer hours. For instance, in Germany, this change would lead to a 30% increase in the labor supply. In Southern Europe, where workers already put in more hours on average, the effect would be less pronounced. Such a dramatic increase in hours worked in Western European countries would very likely lead to a worsening of other parameters, like the participation rate, as we will show in the next paragraph. Still, it underscores the potential for improvement from this perspective.

No silver bullet, just a silver tsunami

While the data above appears promising, we can hardly expect these factors to improve in isolation. There is a strong correlation between productivity, hours worked, and labor participation rates. However, the causal relationship is not entirely clear. Improved productivity could translate to fewer hours worked as the necessity for longer workweeks to sustain a certain lifestyle diminishes, for example. On the other hand, working less hours could also lead to higher productivity because of diminishing returns. Similarly, a reciprocal relationship exists between participation rates and hours worked. Individuals entering the labor force when participation rates are already high tend to work fewer hours. This likely results from maintaining an adequate worklife balance at the household level, especially when children are involved.

This sobering reality suggests that there is no silver bullet for these challenges, unless workers can be persuaded to make changes independently. Whether it’s working more hours, extending their careers, or maintaining full-time contracts even as productivity and participation rates improve, each scenario requires serious effort to convince workers. The Italians have recently demonstrated that such a thing is indeed possible. Average hours worked have risen compared to pre-pandemic years, despite the fact that the participation rate has continued to increase. Going against the usual current will require some extra commitment though.

Productivity growth remains an open question

In addition to addressing the demographic decline by encouraging increased workforce participation, another crucial factor to consider is enhancing productivity levels. Higher productivity growth could mitigate the negative impact of declining labor supply on the economy. However, achieving this goal is far from straightforward. Despite numerous attempts to revive it, productivity growth in the Eurozone has essentially halved since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). While there are high expectations for technological advancements in AI to turn the tide, the current level of uncertainty makes it too challenging to make any definitive conjectures about the potential breadth and significance of such a productivity boost. The same holds for the impact of reforms and investments spurred with the EU’s Recovery and Resilience Facility, especially in Southern Eurozone member states. This is also true initiatives to strengthen Europe’s strategic autonomy by focusing more investment in sustainable energy, the semi-conductor sector, etc. These questions, however, are beyond the scope of this research note.

Decades ago, it was already clear that Europe would have to face the problems of its aging population at some point. Although governments have prepared themselves to some extent, it is unlikely to be enough to turn the tide. A shrinking (working) population will put a dent in Europe’s economic outlook, even if the potential of the working-age population is stretched to its limits. Lower economic growth does not automatically imply lower welfare to the same extent, given that you have to share the pie with fewer people. That said, it will have a profound impact on factors such as the affordability of public services and social benefits, debt sustainability, and on the Europe’s relative power compared to both its allies and rivals. In order to maintain the welfare state and prevent a negative spiral of austerity and economic growth, governments will likely have to both incentivize labor supply and find ways to improve the productivity of its workforce. This is easier said than done.

This past week I covered a lot of what I believe will prove to be important ground, not the least of which was my interview with veteran floor trader Jack Boroudjian.

2024-04-27 11:58:45,Diversity Hire Karine Jean-Pierre Nearly Diversity-Fired in Palace Coup: Report,https://web.archive.org/web/20240428125739/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-27/diversity-hire-karine-jean-pierre-nearly-diversity-fired-palace-coup-report,"Originally published viaArmageddon Prose:

Everyone’s favorite borderline-retarded DEI labradoodle, Karine Jean-Pierre — she who has singlehandedly done more than any one individual on Earth to highlight the unviability of the racial quota concept as a governing principle — nearly got the boot in a backstabbing palace coup.

Old Yeller was a beloved and loyal mascot, too. But we all know how that tragic story concluded.

ViaNew York Post(emphasis added):

“Top aides to President Biden secretly hatched a plan this past fall to replace White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierreby recruiting outside allies to nudge her out the door, The Post has learned.

Jean-Pierre, whomade history in May 2022 by becoming the first black and first openly gay person to hold the position, had developed the exasperating habit of reading canned answers directly from a binder to reporters at her regular briefings —offering what her superiors viewed as a less-than-compelling pitch for the 81-year-old Bidenas he readied his re-election campaign.

De facto White House communications chief Anita Dunn, 66, the wife of Biden personal attorney Bob Bauer, told colleagues she had decided to call in prominent Democrats to explain to Jean-Pierre, 49, that the time was ripe to move on, sources told The Post.

‘There were a number of people she asked to engage Karine,’ said one source who heard of the strategy directly from Dunn, whose role as senior adviser has been filled during the past three presidencies by Jared Kushner (Donald Trump), Valerie Jarrett (Barack Obama) and Karl Rove (George W. Bush).

The source also told The Post that Dunn had claimed White House chief of staff Jeff Zients knew about and supported the cloak-and-dagger scheme to push Jean-Pierre out of the West Wing.

‘There was an effort to have some outside folks who Karine knowsand truststalk to her about why leaving last fall would have made a lot of sense for her and her career,’ the source said, calling it an ‘effort to encourage her to move along.’”

My speculative belief is that the Brandon entity’s handlers must have realized what they had stepped in as soon as KJP’s more competent predecessor, Jen Psaki, left to cosplay as a newswoman at MSNBC state media, and they were left with KJP as the obvious heir to the throne with no real escape hatch, given their professed fidelity to Equity™.

It was impossible, then, at that very moment, they must have realized, to do anything to remedy the situation without incurring the wrath of the Social Justice™ Red Guard who would rain hellfire down on the White House if it fired a black lesbian immigrant lady, no matter how objectively terrible she is at her job — which is excruciatingly bad, like watching a toddler struggle through sounding out the words in a children’s book, even though it has lots of pictures and one-sentence paragraphs.

And when your demented boss fabricates nonsense tales regularly about his family member being eaten by cannibals, there’s really very little margin for incompetency in a government propagandist.

Karine represents the same essential dilemma the Democrat Party is in vis a vis the Karamel-uh entity; Brandon is well past his sell-by date, but replacing him with anyone other than the glass ceiling-shattering black lady would go over like a lead balloon with the base.

The only obvious solution, apparently confirmed through the above reporting, was to entice Karine to leave of her own volition by bribing her with promises of becoming chief DEI commissar at Walmart or Raytheon or whatever.

I, for one, would be at a loss if KJP were let go.

The amount of material I and other domestic terrorist journalists have extracted out of the KJP shitshow is almost worth the cost of a crumbled Western civilization that she represents; it’s damn near a cottage industry.

2024-04-27 15:45:00,NHTSA Probes Tesla Autopilot Again After 20 Crashes Since Update Remedy,https://web.archive.org/web/20240428125739/https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/tesla-autopilot-probed-again-after-20-crashes-update-remedy#comment-stream,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating Tesla's Autopilot (again) to determine if the over-the-air update to the automated driving system was enough to keep drivers on the road.

The new probe comes after the NHTSA closed a multi-year investigation into Autopilot. The prior report found evidence that ""Tesla's weak driver engagement system was not appropriate for Autopilot's permissive operating capabilities,"" which resulted in a ""critical safety gap.""

On Friday, NHTSA said the original Autopilot investigation was opened to see if ""Tesla's Autopilot contained a defect that created an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety,"" adding that it discovered similar findings with Tesla's voluntary recall (Recall 23V838).

The initial investigation found at least 13 crashes involving one or more fatalities, many more involving severe injuries, in which ""foreseeable driver misuse played an apparent role,"" NHTSA said.

The new investigation covers two million Model Y, X, S, 3, and Cybertruck vehicles equipped with Autopilot produced between 2012 and 2024.

The federal agency is concerned about whether the company's remedy was enough, partly because 20 crashes have occurred since the over-the-air software update earlier this year.

One ZH reader reached out to us about Autopilot, explaining that the automated driving system has become increasingly aggressive in making sure the operator is paying attention since the update. The individual told us he was suspended from using Autopilot earlier this week for what he says were 'minor' distractions while driving, adding that the warning system is getting more strict by the update.

During a call with investors earlier this week, Elon Musk said, ""I actually do not think that there will be significant regulatory barriers, provided there is conclusive data that the autonomous car is safer than a human-driven car,"" adding that those who doubt Tesla's ability to ""solve"" autonomy shouldn't invest in the company.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration has weaponized federal agencies against Musk's companies, such as SpaceX and Tesla. This is mainly over Musk's 'free speech' platform, ""X,"" which the Biden administration despised because it has been unable to suppress the First Amendment on the platform through the censorship-industrial complex.

2024-04-27 16:20:00,From Bird Flu To Climate Snakes,https://web.archive.org/web/20240428125739/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/bird-flu-climate-snakes#comment-stream,"Authored by Breeauna Sagdal via The Brownstone Institute,

Seasoned veterinarians and livestock producers alike have been scratching their heads trying to understand the media’s response to the avian flu.

Headlines acrossevery major news outletwarn of humans becoming infected with the “deadly” bird flu after one reported case of pink-eye in a human.

The entire narrative is predicated upon a long-disputed claim that Covid-19 was the result of a zoonotic jump—the famed Wuhan bat wet-market theory.

While the source of Covid is hotly contested within the scientific community, the policy vehicle at the center of this dialectic began years prior to Sars-CoV-2 and is quite resolute in force and effect.

In 2016, the Gates Foundation donated to the World Health Organization to create the OneHealth Initiative.Since 2020, theCDC has adopted and implementedthe OneHealth Initiative to build a “collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approach—working at the local, regional, national, and global levels—with the goal of achieving optimal health outcomes recognizing the interconnection between people, animals, plants, and their shared environment.”

In the aftermath of Covid-19, the OneHealth Initiative began taking shape, due largely in part to millions of tax dollars appropriated through ARP (American Rescue Plan) funding.

Through its APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Investigation System) the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) was given$300 million in 2021 to begin implementing“a risk-based, comprehensive, integrated disease monitoring and surveillance system domestically…to build additional capacity for zoonotic disease surveillance and prevention,” globally.

“The One Health concept recognizes that the health of people, animals, and the environment are all linked,”said USDA Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs Jenny Lester Moffitt.

According to theUSDA’s press release, the Biden-Harris administration’s OneHealth approach will also help to ensure “new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate smart food and forestry practices,” by “making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America.”

In other words, the federal government is using regulatory enforcement to intervene in the marketplace, in addition to subsidizing corporations with tax dollars to direct a planned economic outcome—ending meat consumption.

Under the recently announcedClimate-Smart Commodities program, the USDA has appropriated $3.1 billion in tax subsidies to one hundred and forty-one new private Climate-Smart projects, ranging from carbon sequestration to Climate-Smart meat and forestry practices.

Private investors such as Amazon founderJeff Bezos– who just committed $1 billion to the development of lab cultured meat-like molds, and meat grown in petri dishes, to

Ballpark, formerlyknown for its hot dogs but is now harvesting python meat, is rushing to cash in on this new industry, and the OneHealth/USDA certification program.

Meanwhile, the last vestiges of America’s food freedom and decentralized food sources are quietly being targeted by the full force of the federal government.

The once voluntary APHIS System is poised to become themandatory APHIS-15, which among many other changes, “the system will be renamed Animal Health, Disease, and Pest Surveillance and Management System, USDA/APHIS-15. This system is used by APHIS to collect, manage, and evaluate animal health data for disease and pest control and surveillance programs.”

Among those “many changes” that APHIS-15 is undergoing, one should be of particular interest to the public—the removal of all references to thevoluntary*Bovine Johne’s Disease Control Program.

“Updating the authority for maintenance of the system to remove reference to the Bovine Johne’s Disease Control Program.”

In addition to removing references to the once-voluntary herd culling program, theUSDA is also implementing mandatory RFID ear tags in cattle and bison.

According to the USDA/APHIS-15, expanded authority places disease tracing in their jurisdiction and the radio frequency ear tags are necessary for the “rapid and accurate recordkeeping for this volume of animals and movement,” which they say “is not achievable without electronic systems.”

The notice clearly spells out that RFID tags “may be read without restraint as the animal goes past an electronic reader.”

“Once the reader scans the tag, the electronically collected tag number can be rapidly and accurately transmitted from the reader to a connected electronic database.”

However, industry leaders and lawmakers alike have said the database will be used to track vaccination history and movement, and that this data may be used to impact the market rate of cattle and bison at the time of processing.

In addition to the vast new authority of the USDA funded through the OneHealth Initiative, and the ARP, the EPA has also created its own unique set of regulatory burdens upon the entire meat industry.

On March 25, 2024, the EPA finalized a new set of Clean Water Act rule changes to limit nitrogen and phosphorus “pollutants” in downstream water treatment facilities from processing facilities. While the EPA’s interpretation of authority and jurisdiction over wastewater is concerning long-term, the broader context of consolidated processing under four multinational meat-packing companies is of much greater concern for the immediate future.

With few exceptions, in the United States it is illegal to sell meat without a USDA certification. Currently, the only way to access USDA certification is through a USDA-certified processing facility.

According to the EPA, the new rules will impact up to 845 processing facilities nationwide, unless facilities drastically limit the amount of meat they process each year.

With processing capabilities being the number one barrier to market for livestock producers, and billions of dollars in grants being awarded to Climate-Smart food substitutes, the amount of government intervention into the marketplace becomes very clear.

The United States, once a consumer-demand free market society, is currently witnessing the use of government force, and intervention tactics to steer and manipulate the marketplace.Similar to 1930’s Italy, this is being achieved by the state within the state, through the use of selectionism, protectionism, and economic planning between public-private partnership agreements.

The long-term and unavoidable problem with economic fascism is that it leads to authoritarian and centralized control, from which escape is impossible.

As each industry becomes centralized and consolidated under the few, consumer choice simultaneously disappears. As choice disappears, so does the ability of the individual to meet their specific and unique needs.

Eventually, the individual no longer serves a role outside of its usefulness to the state—the final exhale before the last python squeeze.

2024-04-27 16:55:00,"Putin Did Not Order Alexei Navalny's Death, US Intelligence Finds",https://web.archive.org/web/20240428125739/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/putin-did-not-order-alexei-navalnys-death-us-intelligence-community-says,"In a surprising turn,The Wall Street Journalhas issued a new weekend report saying that US intelligence agencies do not believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin planned or ordered the death of opposition activist and politician Alexei Navalny.

""U.S. intelligence agencies have determined that Putinlikely didn’t order Navalny to be killed at the notoriously brutal prison camp in February, people familiar with the matter said, a finding that deepens the mystery about the circumstances of his death,"" writestheJournal.

""The assessment doesn’t dispute Putin’s culpability for Navalny’s death, but rather findshe probably didn’t order it at that moment,"" WSJ continues. ""The finding is broadly accepted within the intelligence community and shared by several agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the State Department’s intelligence unit, the people said.""

And yet it must be recalled that Western officials and media pundits alike had immediately upon reports of the 47-year old Navalny's deathrushed to declare that he had been 'assassinated'by Russian authorities upon Putin's order.

This led to a new wave of US-led sanctions on Russia, and even disrupted momentum toward a hoped-for prisoner swap between Moscow and Kiev at the time.

President Bidenhad assertedin a statement issued on the very day of his Feb.16 death that""Putin is responsible for Navalny's death""and that it was""proof of Putin's Brutality""- but ultimately that the 'democratic future' Navalny believed in was worth ""dying for"" - according to the president's words at the time.

Russian prison authorities had officially listed his demise as from ""sudden death syndrome,"" which is how natural causes such as heart attacks are typically described.

Navalny's team is not happy with the fresh WSJ report which is being seen as essentially anexoneration of Putin:

In a statement to the Journal, Leonid Volkov,a longtime Navalny ally, rejected the U.S. intelligence assessmentand said those who assert that Putin wasn’t aware of Navalny’s death “clearly do not understand anything about how modern day Russia runs.”

“The idea of Putin being not informed and not approving killing Navalny is ridiculous,” he said.

You will find more infographics atStatista

Below, journalist and geopolitical commentatorAaron Maté explainsthat despite news of Navalny's life and death having driven world headlines, he was still largely an unknown within broader Russian politics and society especially on a national level[emphasis ZH].

Navalny was a marginal opposition figure who polled at around 2%.Putin didn't fear him; it served Putin to have him seen in the West as his main opposition.

The Russian gov't meanwhile has just barred anti-war candidate Boris Nadezhdin. A Russian court has also issued a draconian prison sentence to anti-war sociologist Boris Kagarlitsky.We don't hear about people like Nadezhdin and Kagarlitsky in the West nearly as much for one reason: unlike Navalny, they don't collaborate with Western governments.

Navalny worked with NATO intel cutout Bellingcat and went through the ""Yale World Fellow"" program, a regime change training ground. For this reason, we also don't hear that Navalny wasan unrepentant xenophobewhocompared Muslim immigrants to cockroachesand rotten teeth.

His death is a tragedy. He was undoubtedly mistreated. But because he served US interests, US state media will make him into someone he was not.And just compare their fawning coverage to their silence on, or even support for, the ongoing persecution of Julian Assange. Or their complete silence on the mistreatment and death of US citizen Gonzalo Lira in Ukrainian custody -- universally ignored in US media.

2024-04-27 18:40:00,Chinese Nationals Charged With Conspiracy to Export US Technology,https://web.archive.org/web/20240428125739/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/chinese-nationals-charged-conspiracy-export-us-technology#comment-stream,"Authored by Matt McGregor via The Epoch Times,

The Department of Justice has arrested two Chinese nationals who allegedly plotted to export U.S. technology to advance the People’s Republic of China’s military operations.

Han Li, 44, and Lin Chen, 64, have been charged with several counts of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), in addition to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), for attempting to export a machine used to process silicon microchips.

“The export restrictions at issue in this case were put in place to prevent the illicit procurement of commodities and technologies for unauthorized military end use in the People’s Republic of China,” U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California Ismail Ramsey said in apress releaseon the arrests.

“This office will continue to vigorously enforce the nation’s export laws, including those pertaining to advanced technologies, to protect our national security.”

Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olson explained that the defendants “sought to evade export controls to obtain U.S. semiconductors” that they were then going to ship to a Chinese company.

In 2014, the Department of Commerce placed restrictions on the Chengdu GaStone Technology Company (CGTC) based in China, which made it “ineligible to receive exports of certain U.S. technologies and services.”

“As alleged in the indictment, between at least May 2015 and August 2018, Li and Chen conspired to evade the export restrictions imposed by the Department of Commerce on CGTC by using intermediary companies,” the DOJ said.

“Specifically, the defendants sought to illegally obtain for CGTC a DTX-150 Automatic Diamond Scriber Breaker machine from Dynatex International, a Santa Rosa, California company.”

The DOJ said the defendants purposefully avoided getting the Department of Commerce’s authorization to export the CGTC, the DOJ said.

“The defendants sought to obtain the machine through an intermediary company called Jiangsu Hantang International (JHI), which they fraudulently represented as the purchaser and end user, a proxy they fraudulently represented as the purchaser and end user,” the DOJ said.

“To avoid detection, Li and Chen instructed Dynatex International to ensure that the export information associated with the sale did not list CGTC as the ultimate consignee of the shipment.”

Li, the DOJ said, is suspected to be in China.

Both Li and Chen are charged with counts of conspiracy to violate IEEPA, which carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a $1 million fine, and a count of false electronic export information activities, which carries a sentence of up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. They are also charged on a count of smuggling, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, and IEEPA violations, which carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a $1 million fine.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California and the DOJ’s National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control department will prosecute the case.

“This arrest highlights the importance of interagency collaboration in preventing illegal exports that could compromise sensitive technologies and our national security as well as undermine our American economy,” said Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge Tatum King.

Brent Burmester, a special agent in charge with the Department of Commerce, said stopping “the flow of U.S. semiconductor technology” that goes to advance the People’s Republic of China’s “military modernization efforts” is key to protecting the country’s national security.

FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Tripp suggested that businesses in the U.S. should establish a relationship with their local FBI field office “to help protect against the pervasive threat of criminals looking to steal American technology.”

“We will aggressively pursue anyone who violates export control laws designed to protect our national and economic security,” Mr. Tripp said.

In a 2023reporton FBI Director Christopher Wray’s roundtable discussion on CBS News, Mr. Wray called the Chinese Communist Party “the defining threat of this generation.”

He said in the discussion that the FBI has 2,000 active investigations “just related to the Chinese government’s effort to steal information.”

“There is no country that presents a broader, more comprehensive threat to our ideas, our innovation, our economic security, and ultimately our national security,”he said.

2024-04-27 20:25:00,Adam Schiff Robbed In San Francisco,https://web.archive.org/web/20240428125739/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/adam-schiff-robbed-san-francisco,"Via the Post Millennial,

Democratic CongressmanAdam Schiff’s luggage was stolen out of his parked car in a downtownSan Franciscoparking garage on Thursday. He later attended speaking event and dinner in a shirt and hiking vest.

According to theSan Francisco Chronicle, the left-wing Senate hopeful was at the event to thank high-profile lawyer Joe Cotchett for his support to replace the late Dianne Feinstein.

The outlet reported that Schiff’s car had been parked in the garage to visit the area.

Cotchett’s press agent Lee Houskeeper, who was at the dinner at Ristorante Rocca and warned Schiff not to leave anything in the car, reportedly said, “I guess it’s ‘Welcome to San Francisco.’”

Cotchett said Schiff was not fazed by the incident and went about his business during the visit and acted as if everything was normal.

The congressman told the Chronicle,“Yes, they took my bags. But I’m here to thank Joe.”

Schiff ended up speaking without a suit jacket during the event and instead donned a shirt and hiking vest.

“Maybe he can go out with Willie Brown to choose a new suit from one of the many fine clothing establishments in San Francisco,” Houskeeper joked, mentioning the former San Francisco mayor.  “Willie knows them all.”

Schiff grew up in the city and has been in the California delegations for over 20 years while crime has become a growing issue for Californians.

Crime has in San Francisco has led a mass exodus of retailers from the downtown core. This includes the likes of stores such asJ. Crew,Old Navy,Nordstrom Rack, andentire mallsclosing up shop.

Last year a CNN crew that was reporting on the rampant crime hadtheir vehicle broken into and equipment stolen.

2024-04-27 21:00:00,How The Supreme Court's Immunity Decision Could Limit The Cases Against Trump,https://web.archive.org/web/20240428125739/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/how-supreme-courts-immunity-decision-could-limit-cases-against-trump,"Authored by Sam Dorman via The Epoch Times,

The Supreme Court indicated on April 25 that it would issue a narrow ruling refining the scope of presidential immunity while leaving the details of former President Donald Trump’s other legal battles up to lower courts.

The most immediate effect of their decision on President Trump’s legal battles would be to delay his Washington case, where his immunity appeal originated.That trial was scheduled to start on March 4 but, more recently, observers have been questioning whether it will even start before the election.

Sending the case back to D.C. District Judge Tanya Chutkan would presumably force her to continue pre-trial proceedings with an added layer: Determining how to square Special Counsel Jack Smith’s indictment with the Supreme Court’s new definition of immunity.

Based on their April 25 questions, the justices are expected to distinguish between official and unofficial acts while ruling that presidents enjoy some immunity for the official ones. But it’s unclear how specific they will be in their description and whether they'll provide enough instructions for the lower court to avoid yet another appeal that could once again reach the Supreme Court.

“The Supreme Court could remand the immunity case with very little, if any, instruction, let the district court come up with its opinion, and then let the appellate court deal with it again,” John Shu, a constitutional law expert who served in both Bush administrations, told The Epoch Times. He added, “I certainly hope that doesn’t happen, because we’d end up right where we are today.”

Even if the case does proceed to trial, it’s questionable how effective it will be without some of the indicted actions that President Trump’s attorney, D. John Sauer, said were private and therefore outside the scope of immunity. Michael Dreeben, who argued for Mr. Smith, said the Justice Department was willing to proceed with a weakened indictment.

Perhaps previewing the court’s opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts worried that without official acts, the trial court may be proceeding with a “one-legged stool.” Mr. Sauer responded that he didn’t think the case “would be able to go forward.”

Mark Miller, senior counsel at the Pacific Legal Foundation,toldThe Epoch Times that Justice Roberts could require a special interrogatory verdict form in which the jury is asked to distinguish between official and nonofficial conduct in weighing President Trump’s case.

It’s difficult to predict how the court’s decision would impact President Trump’s other ongoing criminal cases. Their future may hinge on the justices’ particular phrasing rather than merely distinguishing between official and non-official acts.

The Georgia election case is the most likely to be impacted by the decision since the accusations are most similar to the Washington trial, which will likely loom large in the justices’ deliberations.

But as the court indicated, their eventual opinion will have long-lasting impacts on other cases. “We’re writing a rule for the ages,” Justice Neil Gorsuch told Mr. Dreeben. The opinion would presumably ripple through multiple levels of the justice system as well. In an exchange with Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Mr. Dreeben acknowledged that immunity would apply to both state and federal prosecutions.

On the day of the oral argument, President Trump was facing state charges related to his purported attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election with a “hush money” payment to adult film actress Stephanie Clifford. In that case, he tried raising presidential immunity as a reason to exclude certain evidence since it came from his official communications channels as president.

New York Judge Juan Merchan said the motion was filed too late but it nevertheless highlighted the complicated nature of President Trump’s cases as they relate to immunity. While the alleged payment to Ms. Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, was made before the election, the purported falsification of documents didn’t occur until after he took office.

President Trump theoretically could appeal a conviction in New York based on the Supreme Court’s decision. It’s unclear, however, whether the payments would fall under the type of immunity that the Supreme Court eventually granted.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis requested the Georgia trial start in August but that seemed increasingly unlikely after information surfaced about her affair with Nathan Wade, one of her top prosecutors.

“That’s not even going to ... start before the election,”Article III Project senior counsel Will Chamberlain told The Epoch Times.

Kevin O'Brien, a former assistant U.S. attorney, similarly told The Epoch Times that “no one” knows when the Georgia trial will start. “Even under the best of circumstances, it wasn’t going to start until next year,” he said.

If the Georgia trial proceeded, Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee would presumably need to parse out that indictment like Judge Chutkan would with the one in Washington.

Besides President Trump, more than a dozen others were named in the Georgia indictment. Those included former aides like former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Experts like South Texas College of Law Professor Josh Blackman and Mr. Chamberlain suggested it was unlikely the immunity decision would afford substantial protection to defendants other than President Trump.

Mr. Meadows filed an amicus brief in which he told the Supreme Court that the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution made him immune from charges in Fulton County because they “arise from his official acts as Chief of Staff.” It’s unclear how the court will rule or affirm criminal immunity for advisers, if at all.

“The Court should therefore take care to ensure that it leaves intact the robust immunity from state prosecution afforded under the Supremacy Clause, particularly as it relates to subordinate federal officials,”he said.

President Trump’s remaining federal case in Florida involves his handling of classified documents and was initially scheduled to start on May 20, but that appeared to be in limbo. The Supreme Court is expected to issue an opinion in June, meaning that a delayed trial in Florida could see an attempt by President Trump to raise legal arguments from the justices’ opinions.

As in the New York case, it appeared that President Trump could appeal a would-be conviction depending on the scope of immunity provided by the Supreme Court’s decision. “It would definitely impact [the Florida and Georgia cases] because both of those deal with what Trump and his lawyers would argue are official acts,” constitutional attorney Gayle Trotter told The Epoch Times.

In February, President Trump asked Florida Judge Aileen Cannon to dismiss 32 counts in his indictment based on presidential immunity. She has yet to issue a decision on that motion.

Regardless of how the justices rule on immunity, oral argument raised the prospect that presidents can override the effects of state and federal prosecutions by pardoning themselves.

Assuming any of his trials extend past his would-be inauguration, it’s questionable whether he could use his pardon authority on himself.

Justice Gorsuch noted that “happily,” the question of a president’s self-pardoning “has never been presented to us.”Mr. Dreeben told the court: “I don’t believe the Department of Justice has taken a position [on self-pardoning]. The only authority that I’m aware of is a member of the Office of Legal Counsel wrote on a memorandum that there is no self-pardon authority. As far as I know, the Department has not addressed it further.”

2024-04-27 22:10:00,The Scramble For Antarctica,https://web.archive.org/web/20240428125739/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/scramble-antarctica,"Authored by Gregory Copley via The Epoch Times,

The “scramble for Antarctica” is slowly gathering steam, and it is not unrelated to a new “scramble for the Americas.”The ramifications for the Indo-Pacific and, indeed, for the global strategic balance are also profound.

By 2024, Antarctica had at least 82 bases from more than 30 countries. China has five bases, three built within the past decade (the latest in February), and three with year-round manning.

Antarctica, in its own right, is home to many mineral and oceanic riches, but it is also key to a number of military, navigational, and other resources.The revival of interest in global-reach fractional orbital bombardment systems (FOBS), for example, relying on polar orbit delivery of hypersonic weapons, depends on having assets in both polar regions. The region may have certain properties that are ideal for collecting signals intelligence.

But the case of Antarctica is particularly interesting because it is, in essence, “no man’s land,” truly aterra nullius; it is the last major landmass that is essentially outside the realm of the “ownership” of national governments.

Significantly, the “scramble for Africa,” which reached its zenith in the 19th century, is now facing the prospect of a widespread and not necessarily peaceful “undoing” as the great powers comprehensively lose their influence there. But that is another story. What is significant now is the competition of the major powers and others for dominance in Antarctica, and this is not unrelated to interest in the Arctic.

Change throughout the global systems of governance was accelerating through 2024, with the main focus on the internal divisions of most societies, the decline in trust in—or prestige of—almost all nation-states and their governance, and a breakdown in transnational governance bodies. In macro terms, it is a period of conflict between globalist totalitarianism and nationalism.

But if Africa was perceived in and before the 19th century as a region ripe for conquest and exploitation, and many areas of the world were then only beginning to be opened to a new, industrialized world, then Antarctica today is the great treasure open for seizure, if only for the fact that it has no native inhabitants capable of speaking for themselves.

The tenets of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty are being largely honored in the breach. The treaty primarily spells out the demilitarization of the continent. While it is true that there are no formal combatant forces there, it is not true that the landmass is free from military and strategic usage. The Antarctic Treaty, initially proposed by the United States, was adopted in 1959 by 12 nations: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, the USSR, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A number of other nations acceded to the treaty, among which Brazil, (then) West Germany, India, and Poland were the most actively engaged in Antarctic research. The treaty supposedly ensured the non-militarization of the continent and freedom of scientific investigation.

Nothing in the treaty was, the 1959 document said, to be interpreted as “a renunciation or diminution by any Contracting Party of any basis of claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica.” Thus, the seven nations that have outstanding (and often overlapping) claims to Antarctica emanating outward like slices of a pie—Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK—may harbor hopes to have their claims recognized internationally “at some future time.”

That future time has begun.

The claims have been staked, and the next decade may see some of these claims become concrete. At the time of the Antarctic Treaty’s creation, the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) claimed the right to acquire the entire Antarctic. The Russian Federation, which succeeded the USSR, has not renounced that option.

A widely accepted but not fixed concept on which nations have territorial rights to Antarctica is based on sovereign land exposure to the continent. Thus, the exposure is determined by a “pie-chart” set of lines from the South Pole to the eastern and western extremes of the facing landmass. Under this arrangement, Australia is the largest stakeholder in Antarctica, and the South Atlantic British territories, such as the Falkland Islands and South George, give the UK exposure to the continent. Chile, Argentina, New Zealand, and France also have claims under this formula. It would not be unexpected for South Africa to stake a claim under this arrangement.

But thus far, it has all been based on the 1959 Treaty and “understandings.” Nothing has been defined and tested by conquest or the increasingly frail “international courts.” We are in an age when Cold War and post-Cold War treaties are being discarded—often wisely because they have been overtaken by history—while we plunge further into the age when supposedly binding treaties are being interpreted as “suggestions.” And global governance mechanisms, such as the United Nations and regional organizations, are unable to halt unilateral power projection by force.

Significantly, communist China does not see Antarctica in isolation but as a component of its global—and globalist—projection.

China on Feb. 7 inaugurated its Ross Sea scientific research station near the Ross Sea region and the U.S. McMurdo station and those of New Zealand, South Korea, Italy, Germany, and France, starting operations in an outpost in a part of the Antarctic due south of Australia and New Zealand for the first time. The Qinling station will be staffed year-round with quarters sufficient to house as many as 80 people in the summer months. China has four other research stations in other parts of Antarctica built from 1985 to 2014—Zhongshan, Taishan, Kunlun, and Great Wall—with two year-round stations like Qinling.

Chinese ice-breaker Xuelong, or “Snow Dragon,” sets off from a port in Shanghai on Nov. 8, 2017. Xuelong steamed south from Shanghai on Nov. 8, bound for Antarctica to establish China's newest base as Beijing strives to become a polar power. (STR/AFP via Getty Images)

Construction of Qinling first broke ground in 2018, but its launch was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2023, China sent its biggest Antarctic fleet and more than 460 personnel to the site to help complete the station.

However, in the broader sense, the 2020s began to see the unraveling of those Cold War and immediate post-Cold War treaties, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, largely because they constrained the Western alliance and Russia but did not put limitations on Beijing.

The result is that the world is entering an era when not only are formal arrangements governing military behavior disintegrating, and the so-called rules-based world order is being repudiated (particularly by the Chinese regime), but so, too, is the influence of regional bodies, such as the African Union (AU), the Organization of American States (OAS), and so on.

The OAS has, in fact, become meaningless. This links to the Antarctica question because China has not only been building its polar capacities but has also built linked installations in South America for its space capacities.

China’s Espacio Lejano Station, which, according to Wikipedia, “is a radio station located in Loncopué Department, Neuquén Province, Argentina, and is operated by the Chinese National Space Administration as part of the Chinese Deep Space Network, in collaboration with Argentina’s National Space Activities Commission (CONAE). The Chinese Deep Space Network is managed by the China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General (CLTC), which reports to the People’s Liberation Army [PLA] Strategic Support Force.” No Argentine officials, including those from CONAE, are permitted access to the 200-hectare facility, which has been operating since 2018.

Argentina’s new president, Javier Milei, was reported in 2024 to be anxious to ensure Argentinian access to the base. China is also known to utilize South America for other space-related activities.

Argentina's new president, Javier Milei, speaks to the crowd from a balcony of the Casa Rosada government palace during his inauguration day in Buenos Aires on Dec. 10, 2023. (Cezaro de Luca/AFP via Getty Images)

The Argentine Congress did not approve the 50-year lease to China of the land for the station until February 2015, but work had already begun on it in 2013, and it was completed in 2017.

Meanwhile, the Chinese regime’s penetration of the entire Caribbean network of small countries, as well as much of the Western Hemisphere south of the United States, has been completed for some time. The old U.S. Monroe Doctrine, initiated in 1823 to give Washington the “right” to keep European powers out of the southern Americas, has completely given way to the influence of Beijing.

So what happens when China breaks apart strategically, and how will this happen?

China is becoming increasingly preoccupied with internal difficulties and threats. Its economy, never as large as Beijing claimed in recent years, is now in tatters. The fact that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) views the internal threat as greater than the external challenge is exemplified by the reality that it spends more on internal security forces than the People’s Liberation Army.

While building its gold reserves to diversify away from the U.S. dollar (Beijing is quietly moving out of its holdings of U.S. debt), China is facing a shortage of funds and is, in any event, facing the prospect of a leadership challenge. This portends an open question, but what is clear is that a period of chaos can be anticipated.

It may be true that the United States has gradually absorbed the impact of a reduced dependence on the Chinese market and funds, but the rest of the Americas have not, and neither has Australia, for example. In a period of transformation, China may well attempt some external adventures that could mark the end of the present strategic framework.This could well unravel Antarctica’s special status.

The deterioration started with theU.S.-China trade warunder President Donald Trump, continued during the coronavirus pandemic that originated inChinaand has recently taken on yet another dimension among concerns about widespread Chinese tech and industrial espionage and subversion as well as continued human rights abuses and tension surrounding Taiwan.

As Statista's Katharina Buchholz details below,among American adults in 2024, unfavorable views of China were voiced by 77 percent of respondents after having reached a high of 84 percent in early 2023. In 2005, that figure had stood at just 47 percent.

You will find more infographics atStatista

In 2023,77 percent of Americans said the viewed Taiwan very or mostly favorable. At the same time,66 percent saw the military power of China as a critical threat, up from 41 percent in 2016.

64 percent said the same about the economic power of China.

Republicans voters saw China more critical with just 6 percent who had a favorable view in 2023, compared to 18 percent of Democrats and 17 percent of Independents.

That year, favorable views of China in the U.S. reached an all-time low of just 15 percent overall. Again, Republicans were more critical of China's military and economic prowess, with 80-81 percent seeing it as a major threat.

2024-04-27 23:20:00,Iran's Nightmares,https://web.archive.org/web/20240428125739/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/irans-nightmares,"Authored by Victor Davis Hanson,

Details of the recent limited Israeli retaliatory strike against Iranian anti-aircraft missile batteries at Isfahan are still sketchy.But nonetheless, we can draw some conclusions.

Israel’s small volley of missiles hit their intended targets,to the point of zeroing in on the very launchers designed to stop such incoming ordnance.

The target was nearthe Natanz enrichment facility.That proximity was by design. Israel showed Iran it could take out the very anti-missile battery designed to thwart an attack on its nearby nuclear facility.

The larger message sent to the world was that Israel could send a retaliatory barrage at Iranian nuclear sites with reasonable assurances that the incoming attacks could not be stopped. By comparison, Iran’s earlier attack on Israel was much greater and more indiscriminate. It was also a huge flop, with an estimated 99 percent of the more than 320 drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles failing to hit their planned targets.

Moreover, it was reported that more than 50 percent of Iran’s roughly 115-120 ballistic missiles failed at launch or malfunctioned in flight.

Collate these facts, and it presents a disturbing corrective to Iran’s non-stop boasts of soon possessing a nuclear arsenal that will obliterate the Jewish state.

Consider further the following nightmarish scenarios: Were Iranian nuclear-tipped missiles ever launched at Israel, they could pass over, in addition to Syria and Iraq, either Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the West Bank, Gaza, or all four. In the cases of Jordan and Saudi Arabia, such trajectories would constitute an act of war, especially considering that some of Iran’s recent aerial barrages were intercepted and destroyed over Arab territory well before they reached Israel.

Iran’s strike prompted Arab nations, the US, the UK, and France to work in concert to destroy almost all of Iran’s drones.For Iran, that is a premonition of the sort of sophisticated aerial opposition it might face if it ever decided to stage a nuclear version.

Even if half of Iran’s ballistic missiles did launch successfully, only a handful apparently neared their intended targets—in sharp contrast to Israel’s successful attack on Iranian missile batteries. Is it thus conceivable that any Iranian-nuclear-tipped missile launched toward Israel might pose as great a threat to Iran itself or its neighbors as to Israel?

And even if such missiles made it into the air and even if they successfully traversed Arab airspace, there is still an overwhelming chance they would be neutralized before detonating above Israel.

Any such launch would warrant an immediate Israeli response. And the incoming bombs and missiles would likely have a 100 percent certainty of evading Iran’s countermeasures and hitting their targets.

Now that the soil of both Iran and Israel is no longer sacred and immune from attack, the mystique of the Iranian nuclear threat has dissipated.

It should be harder for the theocracy to shake down Western governments for hostage bribes, sanctions relief, and Iran-deal giveaways on the implied threat of Iran successfully nuking the Jewish state.

The new reality is that Iran has goaded an Israel that has numerous nuclear weapons and dozens of nuclear-tipped missiles in hardened silos and on submarines. Tehran has zero ability to stop any of these missiles or sophisticated fifth-generation Israeli aircraft armed with nuclear bombs and missiles.

Iran must now fear that if it launched 2-3 nuclear missiles, there would be overwhelming odds that they would either fail at launch, go awry in the air, implode inside Iran, be taken down over Arab territory by Israel’s allies, or be knocked down by the tripartite Israel anti-missile defense system.

Add it all up, and the Iranian attack on Israel seems a historic blunder.It showed the world the impotence of an Iranian aerial assault at the very time it threatens to go nuclear. It revealed that an incompetent Iran may be as much a threat to itself as to its enemies. It opened up a new chapter in which its own soil, thanks to its attack on Israel, is no longer off limits to any Western power.

Its failure to stop a much smaller Israel response, coupled with the overwhelming success of Israel and its allies in stopping a much larger Iranian attack, reminds the Iranian autocracy that its shrill rhetoric is designed to mask its impotence and to hide its own vulnerabilities from its enemies.

And the long-suffering Iranian people?

The truth will come out that its own theocracy hit the Israeli homeland with negligible results and earned a successful, though merely demonstrative, Israeli response in return.

So Iranians will learn their homeland is now vulnerable and, for the future, no longer off limits.

And they will conclude that Israel has more effective allies than Iran and that their own ballistic missiles may be more suicidal than homicidal.

As a result, they may conclude thatthe real enemies of the Iranian nation are not the Jewish people of Israel after all, but their own unhinged Islamist theocrats.

The Ukrainian military has opted to withdraw its US-supplied M1 Abrams main battle tanks from the front lines due to the threat posed by Russian drones, American officials told the Associated Press. Kiev has reportedlylost several of the tanks since their long-delayed deployment in February.

The decision came as Moscow increasingly relies on UAVs forround-the-clock surveillance and air strikes, making the Abrams ""too difficult… to operate without detection or coming under attack,""the APreportedon Thursday. The tanks have been removed from the fight for an unspecified period as Kiev and Washington work to ""reset tactics,"" Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice Chairman Adm. Christopher Grady told the outlet.

""When you think about the way the fight has evolved, massed armor in an environment where unmanned aerial systems are ubiquitous can be at risk,"" Grady added. ""Now, there is a way to do it. We’ll work with our Ukrainian partners, and other partners on the ground, to help them think through how they might use that, in that kind of changed environment now, where everything is seen immediately.""

Though the United Statesagreed to provide 31 Abrams in January 2023, the armor took months to arrive, and even longer before they first saw combat in February. Ukraine has so far lost at least five of the tanks, according to the AP, with Russian forcesclaiming several killssince the Abrams was first spotted on the battlefield. At least one of the tanks was reportedly crippled with a cheaply made kamikaze drone, part of Moscow’s growing fleet of surveillance and armed UAVs.

The ubiquity of drones in the conflict has meant ""there isn’t open ground that you can just drive across without fear of detection,"" another senior defense official told the AP, explaining the decision to sideline the Abrams.

The move comes as Washington steps up assistance to Ukrainian troops following a lull in support, with Congress passing a massive$61 billion military aid packagelast weekend after months of gridlock in the House.

The Pentagon immediatelyapproved a $1 billion shipmenton Wednesday, including artillery rounds, air defense missiles, infantry fighting vehicles and a long list of other gear – the largest round of US aid in several months. Another$6 billion weapons packagewas announced on Friday which is to include munitions for the US-made Patriot air defense system.

Following a failed counteroffensive last summer, Kiev has repeatedly urged for additional weapons from its NATO sponsors, warning it would continue to lose ground to Russian forces without Western-made aircraft, armor and long-range missiles.

On Wednesday, the US State Departmentrevealedit had already sent Ukraine its first shipment of longer-range ATACMS missiles last month, saying the decision was not announced “in order to maintain operational security for Ukraine at their request.”

2024-04-28 08:10:00,PM Orbán At CPAC: The 5 Methods Of Oppression Liberals Use To Silence Conservatives,https://web.archive.org/web/20240428125739/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/pm-orban-cpac-5-methods-oppression-liberals-use-silence-conservatives#comment-stream,"Authored by John Cody via ReMix News,

In the run-up to major elections across the West, including the U.S. presidential election and the EU parliament elections in June, Hungarian Prime Minister ViktorOrbán warned that conservatives face unprecedented pressure from liberals, who are lashing out over fears they may lose power.

During his speech at the third annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Budapest, Hungary, Orbán described five methods of oppression being deployed by liberals to silence the opposition, with the Hungarian prime minister noting that some of the most advanced forms of oppression, including court action and intelligence service spying, are already being deployed against conservatives across the West.

The first step Orbán describes is liberal actions designed to change the meaning of words and phrases in order to mislead the people, with the issue of migration being the most substantial example of this trend.

“The first step of progressive liberals, their oppression, is to make normal mean the exact opposite. War is peace. That is what progressives still say today. The Peace Facility. That’s the name of the Brussels financial fund from which the most destructive weapons are sent to the front. Migration is a resource, they say, while crime is rising, the threat of terror is increasing and trust is being drained from our societies,” said Orbán.

Orban noted that Hungary has been able to withstand this sea change, making it a “unique location in all of Europe.”

“It is the fact that, while the whole of Europe is being swamped by an ocean of progressive liberalism, a conservative island has survived (in Hungary), an Island of Deference, defying the liberal tide, the Brussels blast, and the Washington hurricane. Not only defying but surviving, even thriving, even succeeding, even triumphing and triumphing again and again.”

The second step on the path to liberals maintaining power is to invert everything that is normal, including sexuality, education, family life, love of country, and ethnic homogeneity.

“The second step is to start spreading this inverted normality by state means. Anyone who thinks otherwise is problematic. There is something wrong with that. Anyone who disagrees is either ignorant or insane. The perception must be that listening to them would lead to some fatal disaster,” said Orbán.

This method helps tear families apart, mock cultural and national traditions, and normalize behavior that up until just a few decades ago was considered beyond the pale, Orbán told the conference, adding that liberal subversion had led to “crashing birthrates, soaring divorces, broken families, and a failing education system that focuses more on ideology than academic greatness.”

“All of this is fertile breeding ground for left-wing parties to thrive and paint conservatives and the right as “backward” and deserving of political suppression and even outright violence,” he said.

The next step is to create an aura of “danger” around right-wing and conservative views, which will help the state justify any action taken against conservatives. In the United States, this includes, for example, portraying supporters of Donald Trump as terrorists, or equating any right-wing view as “Nazi.”

“You are made to believe that you hold dangerous views and that you are also a security risk. They send some kind of democracy watchdog at you, which then finds out that you do not share the views of normality they preach, and are therefore a radical whose freedom of speech can be safely restricted,” Orban said.

This particular step has played out across social media, where conservatives and the right face enormous censorship. However, NGOs and organizations, many of whom are lavishly funded by governments, corporations, and billionaire oligarchs such as George Soros, are actively working to silence and persecute conservatives. As Remix News has reported,they are deeply embedded in the major social media networks, and work to police conservative thought and views.

Demonizing conservatives was also evident just last week in Brussels after another conservative conference in which Orbán and many other high-profile politicians from Europe were speaking, was shut down by the local mayor citing public safety concerns.

It took the lawyers of the National Conservatism conference to file last-minute motions in Belgium’s top administrative court to ensure the conference could continue for its second day.

In the fourth step, the liberal press targets you, often personally, while the state turns civilians into a mob of informers, Orbán warned.

“They deploy activists who use legal means to silence you. Then, the often anonymous profiles on the internet come to denounce you on social media, while a plethora of civilians bombard the courts and state bodies with complaints and denunciations,” he added.

“And if you still have the stomach for it, and if you’re still standing, the fifth step is for the public authorities to spring into action. They receive so many complaints and denunciations that they are obliged to investigate you, unfortunately, so they become the private institutions of the progressives,” the Hungarian prime minister explained.

“They will find that the accusations of the press, the concerns of the watchdogs, are well founded, they will prosecute yo,u and you will eventually be silenced by state means. That is what they do to Hungary in Brussels, and that is what they do to conservatives in progressive, liberal European capitals.”

Orbán noted that the same thing was happening in the United States where the judiciary was being utilized in an attempt to get President Trump off the ballot for the upcoming presidential election.

He also pointed to the German government’s actions against the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Due unique laws in Germany, the authorities have been able to label the AfD a “definite case of right-wing extremism” in key eastern states. In turn, this gives intelligence services authority to monitor communications, including phone calls, messages, and emails, between AfD politicians and members — all without a warrant.

“This is what happened in the European Union when they tried to ban Tucker Carlson by administrative means. It is happening in Germany, where political parties are being monitored by the secret services. And it happened in Finland when they wanted tocondemn a politicianand a bishop for quoting Scripture. Ladies and gentlemen, that is where we are.”

The Hungarian leader expressed hope, however, that the tide could turn should the people desire it at the forthcoming polls across the West, including the European Parliamentary elections in June.

He said the elections could help “end an inglorious era of Western civilization” and help defeat a “progressive liberal hegemony” that has only served to bring “war, chaos, and unrest” to Europe, as well as a collapsing economy and confusion to the world.

Instead, the European electorate could vote in favor of a new “world spirit” that promotes nation-state sovereignty as its core principle.

“In that world, national interest will determine the movement of states, and each independent nation will act in its own national interest. I also believe that in a sovereign world order, the real sovereign is the people, as our guests would say, popular sovereignty.

“I hope that it will no longer be NGOs of all kinds, big business, media outlets, dubious experts, and out-of-touch academics who tell us what is right and what should be done, but elected representatives and politicians elected by the people.”

In a rallying cry to fellow conservatives, Orbán urged them to “saddle up, arm up, take to the battlefield, and let the electoral battle begin,” calling for a “return to the peaceful and secure path that made the West great.”

“Make America Great Again, Make Europe Great Again. Go, Donald Trump! Go, European sovereignists!”

2024-04-28 11:40:00,Justice Kavanaugh Warns Of Vicious Cycle Of Malicious Prosecutions That Could End Presidency,https://web.archive.org/web/20240429125225/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/justice-kavanaugh-warns-vicious-cycle-malicious-prosecutions-could-end-presidency,"Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times,

During Thursday’s deliberations at the U.S. Supreme Court on former President Donald Trump’s immunity claim,Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh warned that a decision in the case has future implications for whether future presidents are shielded from vicious cycles of malicious prosecutionthat could effectively end the presidency as we know it.

In the course of two-and-a-half hours oforal argumentson April 25, justices on the Supreme Court appeared skeptical of a ruling by a federal appeals court that rejected President Trump’s claim that he has absolute immunity from criminal charges based on his official acts as president.

President Trump was indicted by special counsel Jack Smith in August 2023 on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Pleading not guilty, the former president has argued that he should receive absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for acts that fell within the scope of his official duties.The exception to this immunity, he has argued, is if Congress impeaches and convicts him on charges.

A federal appeals court rejected that argument, claiming that presidents must face prosecution for alleged criminal wrongdoing.

The question that is now before the Supreme Court is:“Whether and if so to what extent does a former president enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office?”

During Thursday’s deliberations, the justices weighed the claim of absolute immunity that, if adopted, would stop Mr. Smith’s prosecution of the former president dead in its tracks.

Several conservative justices suggested they favor imposing limits on the prosecution of former presidents, while highlighting the importance of the case for the future.

Justice Kavanaugh said that when presidents are subject to prosecution, history shows that it’s not going to stop.

“It’s going to cycle back and be used against the current president or the next president ... and the next president and the next president after that.”

Justice Neil Gorsuch, who said that the court is “writing a rule for the ages,” along with Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Kavanaugh all said that their concern was not so much the case against President Trump, but rather the effect of the ruling on future presidencies.

“This case has huge implications for the presidency, for the future of the presidency, for the future of the country,”Justice Kavanaugh said.

Former Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, who argued for Mr. Smith, said that the framers of the U.S. Constitution never intended for presidents to be above the law.

Mr. Dreeben also said that the crimes President Trump is charged with—including allegedly participating in a scheme to enlist dueling electors in battleground states won by President Joe Biden to cast alternate slates of electoral votes for him—weren’t a part of the president’s official duties.

Attorney D. John Sauer, who argued for President Trump, told the justices thatwithout presidential immunity from criminal charges, the “presidency as we know it” will be changed, contending that the looming threat is that a decision to deny immunity would “destroy” presidential decisionmaking at a time in the nation’s history when it needs to be bold.

Mr. Sauer argued that the impact of the case would have implications far beyond the question at hand, raising the hypothetical prospect of President Biden facing charges of encouraging illegal immigration with his border policies.

Justice Kavanaugh expressed concern about the future implications of the case, warning of the prospect of a vicious cycle of malicious prosecutions that could hamper presidents for years to come.

Mr. Drebeen contended that the laws currently on the books have not shown they are prone to abuse, telling the high court that “we’ve lived from Watergate through the present, through the independent counsel era with all of its flaws, without these prosecutions having gone off on a runaway train.”

Justice Kavanaugh argued that the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton presidencies were all “hampered” by investigations, while suggesting that holding a president accountable is less important than protecting the functioning of the presidency.

He raised the question of the “risk” of a “creative prosecutor” using “vague” statutes against a commander-in-chief, telling Mr. Dreeben that this case has “huge implications” for the presidency, and that he was “very concerned about the future.”

Justice Kavanaugh cited the Supreme Court’s 1988 decision in Morrison v. Olson, which upheld the constitutionality of the independent counsel statute, as“one of the Court’s biggest mistakes” because it “hampered” presidential administrations.He argued that when former presidents are subjected to prosecution, this risks triggering a vicious cycle of vindictive prosecutions.

“What would the reaction be if, in an area not covered by this statute, the Justice Department posted a public notice inviting applicants to assist in an investigation and possible prosecution of a certain prominent person?” he asked.

“Does this not invite what Justice Jackson described as picking the man and then searching the law books or putting investigators to work to pin some offense on him?”

2024-04-28 20:25:00,"Joe Biden's Brother Embroiled In High-Ranking Qatari Scheme To ""Provide Wealth Of Introductions"" Through ""My Family"": Politico",https://web.archive.org/web/20240429125225/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/joe-bidens-brother-embroiled-high-ranking-qatari-scheme-provide-wealth-introductions#comment-stream,"Qatar has had a lot of fingers in a lot of pies. While we knew about the EU's 'Qatargate,' investments with theKushner family, and of course Sen. Bob MenendezadvancingQatar's interests,Politicoreports that the Biden family's ties to Qatar ""would constitute some of the closest known financial links between a relative of President Joe Biden and a foreign government,""if courtroom testimony about Jim Biden's foreign fundraising efforts is substantiated.

In June 2017,Qatar's neighbors - led by Saudi Arabia,banded together and cut diplomatic ties with the country, citing its alleged support for terrorism. As a result,the country was thrown into a sustained crisis.

To dig themselves out, Qatari rulers began showering well-connected Westerners with gifts and financial benefits, according toPolitico, ""sometimes in the form ofinvestment funding.""

Around this time, Jim Biden was trying to raise $30 million for embattled hospital chain Americore -teaming up with Florida businessman Amer Rustom, CEO of the Platinum Group, who boasted of his ties to officials in the Middle East, as well as fund manager Michael Lewitt. Together, the three sought investment funding from various Middle Eastern sources for Americore and other ventures -""which came to focus largely on Qatar,""according to a former Americore executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.

According to public records obtained by the outlet,Jim Biden leveraged ties to his older brother and ""sought workarounds to restrictions on international money movements,"" including one discussion about trying to move money across a Middle Eastern border in the form ofgold barsthat may or may not have happened.

""My family could provide a wealth of introductions and business opportunitiesat the highest levels that I believe would be worthy of the interest of His Excellency,"" Jim Biden and Rustom wrote in a draft letter to an official at the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority. ""On behalf of the Biden family, I welcome your interest here,"" the draft continues.

Transactions related to the efforts arecentral to a recently-settled fraud case brought by the SEC, and are under fresh scrutiny as part of afederal criminal investigationin South Florida.

Jim Biden suggested to congressional investigators in February that his fundraising efforts stalled for lack of viable projects to back. Butthe previously unreported testimonyby fund managerMichael Lewittabout the ownership of the two companies — the Platinum Group USA and Obermeyer Engineering Consulting —indicates that Jim Biden forged closer ties to Qatar’s government than previously understood.-Politico

In February of this year, Jim Biden told impeachment inquiry investigators that roughly$600,000 in paymentsfrom Americore were for his role in arranging a series of bridge loans -of which $200,000 was transferred to Joe Biden in March 2018for what the White House claims is a repayment of an unrelated loan between brothers.

In a March 10, 2018 draft presentationemailedfrom Jim Biden’s wife, Sara Biden, to a Platinum Group executive, Julie Lander, Americore touted Jim as ""Brother and Campaign Finance Chair of former Vice President Joe Biden.""

One month later,Lander emailed Jim Biden about the fundraising efforts- referencing an apparent meetingwith a high-ranking Qatari official.

""I am following up from the meeting we had with the Minister,"" wrote Lander. ""Your approach with him was flawless. He requested more information on Americore.""

In the previously unreported email,Lander suggested a potential request of $200 million and asked Jim Biden to provide more information on the potential benefits to Qatarof an investment deal.

Lander’s email came five days after alarge delegationof Qatari officials and business leaders visited Miami. It is not clear which minister Lander, who did not respond to requests for comments, was referring to. -Politico

Despite Lander's upbeat email to Jim Biden,fundraising efforts hit a 'series of snags,'according toPolitico's anonymous former Americore source, who said that they were facingrestrictions on moving investment funds across borders, and that the former executive ""recalled discussion at one point of trying to move money across a Middle Eastern border in the form of gold bars, but said they were not aware of any action taken on the idea.""

In order to solve their problem,Jim Biden explored working with payment processing company ""Billerfy,""described as an ""open network for global payments,"" for which Jim Biden could be their ""chief global banking emissary"" - until Americore's outside counsel, Christopher Anderson, shot it down.

With progress in Qatar slowing in mid-Mayof 2018 during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan,tensions grew between Jim Biden and his comrades- with Jim Biden venting to Americore CEO Grant White in a May 17 email that he had ""agreed to go to Qatar, Saudi Arabia and China (at my own expense).""

A week later,Jim Biden complained to Rustomover the unsecured funds - writing that ""The $30 million was committed to over two months ago and we made moves predicated on that available line of credit,"" adding ""Things have happened in the interim that are completely understandable, but the fact remains that the $5 million at this point in time is critical in order to get by for the big picture.""

Then inlate June,Lewitt emailed Jim Biden and White about trying tomove money from Dubai to Qatar,referencing an unspecified ""blockage"" that was hindering the process.

""Amer would like me to join Jim for the presentation to the Finance Minister in Doha so as soon as we have the date I will plan my travel,"" the email concluded.

The former Americore executive said thatJim Biden and Lewitt traveled to Qatar in mid-2018 as part of the fundraising efforts, but it is not clear whether any meeting between Jim Biden and Qatar’s then-finance minister, Ali Sharif Al Emadi, took place.

Al Emadi left his post in 2021 after Qatar’s attorney generalordered him arrestedon suspicion of corruption.In January,Reuters reportedthat he was convicted on charges that included laundering more than $5 billion and sentenced to 20 years in prison. -Politico

Efforts to secure funding continuedinto August of 2018, as Jim Biden continued to work with Lewitt and Rustom to secure financing from the Qatar Investment Authority forotherhealth care ventures, according to filings in a since-settledfederal court casein Tennessee in which the three were named as co-defendants.

As they continued to work together,Jim Biden's financial ties to Lewitt deepened- with Lewitt's investment fund, Third Friday, paying Jim Biden's company, Lion Hall Groujp, $225,000 over the course of 2019. While Biden testified that this was a forgiven loan, Lewitt disputed it - tellingPoliticothat Jim Biden's debt was assumed by an unnamed third party.

At the end of the day,Qatar and everyone else balked at the deal.

""We weren’t able to show the financial bona fides of any one particular project,"" said Jim Biden during his impeachment inquiry interview. ""We got pretty far down the road on several hotel complexes, but they never came to fruition.""

Meanwhile, in 2022, investors in Third Fridaysued Lewitt, accusing him ofembezzlementthrough Americore to Jim Biden and others. Lewitt has denied wrongdoing in the ongoing case, while Jim Biden has not been named a defendant.

Lastly, the partners are nowlocked in a bitter legal dispute. During the course of Americore's bankruptcy litigation,documents produced by Lewitt included an agreement between his fund and a Delaware company, Obermeyer Engineering Consulting- which calls for Obermeyer to purchase Third Friday's loans to Americore, along with a 35% stake in the hospital chain, for $30 million.

The agreement includes a signature from Azzam Rustom as Obermeyer’s ""authorized signatory,""which Amer Rustom -Obermayer's 'manager,' contested -saying it the signature was faked.

Lewitt said during testimony that Amer Rustom 'verbally authorized' him to fake his signature on the disputed documents.

Towards the end of the hearing Lewitt was asked why, if the agreements he produced were valid, the Rustoms were contesting them.

Lewitt testified that the Rustoms owned both Obermeyer and the Platinum Group with “members of the Qatari government.” He speculated that the brothers had not cleared the agreements with the Qatari officials, whom he did not name. “I don’t think they expected these to become public,” he testified, “and I think they were trying to cover themselves.” -Politico

According to the judge in the case,""Where there’s smoke, there’s fire,"" adding ""and this is a black haze right now.""

2024-04-28 22:11:00,How Soros' Latest Agitprop Exposed The Hypocrisy Of The Right,https://web.archive.org/web/20240429125225/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-28/how-soros-latest-agitprop-exposed-hypocrisy-right,"It should come as no surprise that the pro-Palestinianprotests across college campuses nationwide have been exposed as another agitprop operation funded by none other than George Soros.Just like in the last election year, the social discord manufactured by Open Society financed movements seeks to inject the masses with a dose of hysteria as election day quickly approaches. Although it is ironic that many speculated, if not outright asserted, that Hamas itself was behind the protests when in fact it is a Jewish man in the form of Soros, it should not be unexpected he would be behind them. Since before the protests took to college campuses, Soros' entities like the Tides Foundation had been funding protests against Israel in cities across the US. Furthermore, many of the colleges that are the hub of the protests are beneficiaries of dark money firms financed by Soros such as Arabella Advisors. This includes Columbia University, which has become the epicenter of these protests.

In the eyes of the right wing of the American political spectrum, that revelation has essentially validated their criticism that these protests are little more than a vehicle for the Cultural Marxist agenda Soros and his acolytes espouse. However, evidence to that point has been sparse as the protests have all but entirely been consistent in their adamant opposition to the US' support of Israel's war in Gaza and haven't deviated into anything like outspokenness explicitly against presidential candidate Donald Trump like previous instances of Soros-orchestrated social justice protests have.Perhaps the hubris of the ""I told you so"" moment that came when Soros' was exposed as the architect of the co-opting these protests has done exactly what the social engineer desired.By provoking the reactionary response against these college protests, Soros has seemingly further fortified the pro-Israel lobby's position by manipulating America's right wing into aligning with it and in doing so exposing its hypocrisy over the issues of free speech and free assembly as a means of anti-establishment activism.

That hypocrisy is easily highlighted by re-examining the events of 2020, the last election year Soros took to these tactics. During the pandemic, Soros' funding of Black Lives Matters protests across the nation highlighted the bias that the political establishment in the US had when it came to respecting the rights of free speech and free assembly. Earlier in the year when other protesters took to venues across the country to oppose lockdowns implemented during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, their demonstrations were broken up under the pretense that the public health emergency that spawned the totalitarian dictate they were rallying against superseded their constitutional rights protecting them in doing so. That unconstitutional violation of the rights to free speech and free assembly wasn't limited to targeting demonstrations defying the government response to the pandemic alone. Those violations were also waged digitally as the federal government's national security and intelligence apparatus' took to sites like Twitter to target conservatives and anyone else who dared to challenge the politically correct COVID-19 narrative.

In the wake of that clearly concerted effort to police free speech to quash any defiance against the powers that be who were behind the pandemic, America's right maligned how the Bill Of Rights had seemingly been desecrated so that the ruling elite could advance their agenda without resistance. While they were right to hold that position, it's taken less than 4 years to memoryhole how the political establishment executes that modus operandi. Now,the same demographic of the electorate that previously held the rights imbued into Americans under the First Amendment as sacred has been manipulated into throwing them out the window.In response to college protests against Israel's war in Gaza, the mainstream American right has become the embodiment of everything they stood against in 2020 by embracing calls to deny protesters their First Amendment rights in support of the neocon axis' self-proclaimed greatest ally: Israel. In doing so, the political faction of the country that was supposedly against the establishment in Washington DC has been assimilated back into it. By doing its bidding as such, the political establishment behind the deep state, permanent Washington, globalism, and whatever other supranational incarnation it takes to undermine the national sovereignty of the United States has regained control of the right.

Of course, the BLM protests of 2020 were far from peaceful protests in any sense of the phrase despite being sanctioned by the government as such. In actuality, they were riots which should not have been protected by the First Amendment in any legal sense aside from the demonstrators who did not turn to vandalism and looting. However,the current protests across college campuses against the war in Gaza are starkly different to the BLM riots of 2020.This is even evident in the political rhetoric issued in response to them. Establishment republicans like Texas Governor Greg Abbott were meticulous in their semantics in 2020, making sure to characterize the BLM chaos as riots. Yet, in addressing the demonstration against the war in Gaza that took place at the University Of Texas, Abbott failed to categorize it as a riot. Instead, the governor quite literally said that ""protests"" against Israel had no place in Texas, a statement that in and off itself is a betrayal of the US Constitution.

Abbott's self-proclaimed position against protests taking against against Israel should come as no surprise. Texas' governor has been a steadfast ally of Israel, frequently warning of the dangers of antisemitism. While that political position is not unusual or even unmerited, it has become undignified in the example of Greg Abbott as it's has been at odds with the rights of his constituents of Texas. Namely, Abbott's championing of anti-BDS legislation which precludes individuals and organizations from coordinating boycotts of Israeli companies on ethical grounds such as concerns over Israel's human rights record has come under fire as a violation of Texans' First Amendment right to free assembly in coordinating a peaceful movement to express their own political position.Inspite of those concerns over Abbott sacrificing Texans' right to free speech, the governor has continued to act as the vanguard of that constitutional right in spite of actions that may suggest otherwise.This dichotomy became especially ironic when Abbott called in the Texas State Department Of Public Safety to break up a pro-Palestinian demonstration on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin after he previously had signed a law into effect that aimed to protect students rights to free speech on college campuses in the wake of suppression against non-politically correct demonstrations against the progressive orthodoxy of academia.

I just signed a law protecting free speech on college campuses.#txlegepic.twitter.com/jHIh8431SH

This ostensible contradiction should come as no surprise to critics of the governor.It was just one month ago that Abbott reaffirmed the criticism that his policies on Israel were the exception to the rules governing free speech in the state of Texas.Ahead of the fever pitch that pro-Palestinian protests across college campuses nationwide have reached, Abbott issued an executive order directing universities across Texas to revise their free speech policies explicitly in instances of speaking out against Israel under the veil of fighting antisemitism. In doing so, Abbott sought to preempt the inevitable conflict that would unfold during protests across campuses across Texas.

The measures Abbott took are the culmination of exactly what the likes of Soros have sought to achieve. Pro-Palestinian protests have enabled social architects like him behind the protests to carefully craft a narrative in response that furthers their ulterior motives. It would be naive to suggest Soros wants a free Palestine or that he wants to highlight the human rights abuses and possible war crimes of the state of Israel. Soros is an agent provacateur, after all.What he wants above all else is chaos.Chaos to bring order out of to further shape the world in his image in the vein of Olam HaTohu and Olan HaTikun, the concepts behind the Kabbalistic tenet of theshattering of the vessels. The aim of principle has been made more palatable in the Jewish ideal ofTikkunOlamor repairing the world, a value that traces its origins to the Mishnah of the Talmud which tasks the Jewish people with rebuilding the world in their image for the better.

What becomes problematic is when the empowerment those principles gives meets the subjectivity of whatgoodis in the eye of the beholder. While Soros' denies having any sort of God complex behind his motives his conduct exemplifies the antithesis.How Soros seeks to create chaos to bring order out of is done politically through the execution of Marx's dialectical materialism.That Marxist theory postulates that influencing real-world conditions can be used to facilitate a change of social structures. For Cultural Marxists, promoting protests in any form serves as a catalyst to achieve that ultimate goal. Though secular on its face, the way Soros has utilized this methodology is analogous to aforementioned Kabbalistic principle of assuming the role of a creator to reshape the world in one's image.

Marxist dialectical materialism often misconstrued as theHegelian Dialecticin conspiratorial circles despite Marx's dialectics literally being based on their opposition to Hegel's. Terminology aside, the dynamic of the dialectic methodology is much more easy to discern. Dialectical material follows the sequence of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Though that progression can be traced to the earliest days of dialectics from ancient Greeks like Xeno of Elea, the modern application in the aim of reshaping social order requires a problem to created in order to provoke a reaction that edges closer to the preordained outcome.In this instance, thethesistakes the form of the pro-Palestianian protests Soros has orchestrated, while the antithesis comes in the form of the prevailing reactionary narrative that has become the false equivocation of being against Israel's war in Gaza as being the same as being antisemitism.The synthesis of those opposing forces achieves its aim of assimilating the aims of the Cultural Marxists supposedly opposed by the American right into its own agenda. For so long to the American right, the sheer concept of ""hate speech"" has been vehemently rejected in recent years as free speech has come under attack. Under the thumb of Soros' latest social engineering projects, the right has come to embrace the weaponization of the idea of hate speech, in doing so further consolidating the pro-Israel lobby's stranglehold on American politics and turning the self-proclaimed last vestige against globalism into its newest accomplice.

There’s a bipartisan effort in Congress to equate criticism of the secular state of Israel to violence toward Jewish people in America.The latter is illegal and the former is protected speech, but if a false equivalency is established, it will be forbidden to criticize Israel.

What furthers evidences how deeply the response to protests across the country is divorced from reality and instead aligned with an underlying agenda is best demonstrated by examining reality in contrast to the simulacra the narrative crafters have morphed it into. According to them, these protests are not instances of citizens exercising their right to free speech because what they are doing is promoting violence against Jewish people. While inciting violence is surely not protected speech under the First Amendment, one would be hard-pressed to find any sort of coordinated message to the effect reactionaries claim exists present on college campuses where these protests have unfolded. All it would take to dispel that notion is a cursory examination of the protests themselves.

For instance, Jewish students at Columbia University have freely joined in support of the pro-Palestinian demonstrators.The Columbia encampment even has seen Jewish students observe the Sabbath and hold Seder to celebrate Passover within its confines.That empirical evidence alone is emblematic that these encampments are not the training camps for Hamas' militants or the building ground of Auschwitz 2.0 their opponents suggest they are.

#ColumbiaUniversityThe video that incensed Netanyahu; Jewish and Palestinian students chanting Seder freedom songs in solidarity with a democratic Palestine advocating for one person, one vote.If such an event can occur at Columbia University, it could transpire anywhere.pic.twitter.com/KR52411I0g

What the self-proclaimed ""liberation zones"" may actually be is a forum for something more contrived for the social engineers who have built them up.George Soros seems to have taken a page out of M.A. Rothschild's book by funding both sides of the Israel/Palestine conflict in order to execute a divide and conquer strategy.In recent days, pro-Palestinian protesters have been confronted by pro-Israel demonstrators who have been mobilized to oppose their counterparts. In doing so, a rash of false flag ""attacks"" have been perpetrated by the pro-Israel demonstrators in an apparent effort to fabricate the claims they've made about an immediate threat to their safety since it hasn't manifest organically as they would have liked so that they would have merit to vilify their opposition.

A Soros-linked pro-Israel NGO has been linked to organizing those efforts to send agitators to protests. In a post on X, the Shirion Collective advertised its first undercover operation,recruiting pro-Israel agitators to incite violence by posing as pro-Palestinian demonstrators.

Love the exposure. Keep it rockin

One instance of this tactic took place on the campus of Northeastern University where over 100 pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested. University police justified the mass arrests by citing that protesters started chanting antisemitic messages. “Last night, the use of antisemitic slurs, including “Kill the Jews” crossed the line,” police stated. “We cannot tolerate this kind of hate on our campus.” However,video evidence from the scene of the arrests shows that the protester who shouted ""Kill the Jews"" appears to have been holding an Israeli flag as part of a contingent of counter protesters opposing the pro-Palestinian demonstrators in an apparent (and successful) effort to elicit a police response against them.

BREAKING: Working Mass can confirm that the antisemitic chants were shouted not by encampment organizers, but by pro-Israel counter-supporters. We are waiting on a response from Northeastern about their decision to arrest their own students in light of this new information.pic.twitter.com/Kuq6ryxqly

The episode on the Northeastern campus isn't the only instance of events being contrived to promote the idea that these protests are inherently violent. Aside from outside agitators, mainstream media outlets have brazenly mischaracterized events on campuses across the nation to further that narrative.

One such sensationalist piece was published by the New York Post during its coverage of the protests enveloping the Yale University campus. The Post ran with the titleJewish Yale Student Journalist Stabbed In The Eye With Palestinian Flag During Protestwhen chronicling the alleged attack on Sahar Tartak, editor-in-chief of the Yale Free Press.According to the article, Tarak stated she has been singled-out and attacked by pro-Palestinian protesters because she was wearing Hasidic Jewish attire when covering the protests.“There’s hundreds of people taunting me and waving the middle finger at me, and then this person waves a Palestinian flag in my face and jabs it in my eye,” Tartak told The Post.

Video that emerged from the alleged attack paints a much different picture.The video shows the pro-Palestinian protester whose flag ""stabbed"" Tartak do little more than make incidental contact with her.The first-person point-of-view from the attack doesn't offer a perspective that can validate whether or not the flag did make contact with the Yale student's eye. However, the optics of the incident caught on camera pale in comparison to Tarak's claims that she was the victim of a targeted attack who had previously been singled out and confronted by the perpetrator. “There’s hundreds of people taunting me and waving the middle finger at me, and then this person waves a Palestinian flag in my face and jabs it in my eye,” Tartak told The Post.

VIRAL STORY: ""I was stabbed in the eye last night on Yale University’s campus because I am a Jew...They pointed their middle fingers at me...and the taunting continued until a six-foot-something male holding a Palestinian flag waved the flag in my face and then stabbed me with…https://t.co/V5Wvhdxrk7pic.twitter.com/V8xK76OHVD

When Tartak spoke with the New York Post, she told reporters that she was shopping for an eye patch as they interviewed her over the phone. One might assume that an injury to an eye that would require medical attention would see the patient being treated provided with an eye patch by the treating physician, though that would be speculative. Perhaps Tartak really was at the eye patch store. However, if that was the case, the gravity of her injury was not apparent as she was able to join the Piers Morgan show without adorning an eye patch. During her appearance on Piers Morgan,Tartak appeared uninjured,at least to the extent that claim of being stabbed in the eye suggested.

.@sahar_tartakclaimed she was stabbed in the eye by a 🇵🇸 flag yesterday — 2 hours ago she was on the Piers Morgan show with 0 injuries and perfectly intact eyes. In the video of her “assault” you can see the man didn’t move once in her direction.pic.twitter.com/pWO0umWjBH

If Tarak's account of her treatment as a Jewish student at Yale doesn't exactly prove that the protesters enveloping the campus have created an unsafe environment, she can at least rest assured that she was outmatched in her futility to make that point. In a separate incident, an X user by the name of William Iannuzzi and his wife took to the Yale campus in an effort to highlight the turmoil Jewish students and faculty faced when confronted by protesters. In a now deleted post from his now private account, Iannuzzi tweeted ""My wife is a brave Jew. We stood alone at Yale University today. She wore no mask and was proud. Notice the horde hiding behind their masks."" In the video, Iannuzzi's wife stands amidst demonstrators wearing a shirt with the work ""JEW"" painted across it, defiantly chanting how she was not afraid of the protesters. The only problem?Despite claiming that she was attempting be defiant in the face of hate, she didn't seem to have any hate to defy as her protest went entirely without incident.Despite the obvious attempts to get the attention of the protesters, Iannuzzi's wife went completely unnoticed. That outcome was not an illustration of the hate filled Yale campus the Iannuzzi's maligned in their virtue signalling post on X.

I still can’t get over how she tried to instigate protestors but no one gaf 😭pic.twitter.com/l0pYJlBVDn

While these instances do not encapsulate the whole of what is a very complex social climate in which a multitude of voices coalesce into a cacophony of conflicting ideas and beliefs, they do serve as evidence that undermines the overly reductive logic posited by those who seek to exploit this chaos to further erode American's rights to free speech and free assembly.What the Marxist undertones of this coordinated attack on free speech show is how deeply ingrained Soros' influence on American politics has become.This is evident in the re-emergence of rhetoric from the Republican Party that hearkens back to the Bush era in which the threat of radical Islam was used to trample over the constitution. This time around, the fear mongering centered around pro-Palestinian protests nationwide has been used to deflect away from criticism of new Republican leadership under Speaker Of The House Mike Johnson. That distraction has shifted the narrative away from criticizing his broken promises to America First voters then reached their overture when he cast the deciding vote to re-authorize Section 702 of the FISA act and through the role he played in leading the house to pass the $95 billion joint aid package to Ukraine, Taiwan, and of course; Israel. By being able to point to the contrived optics of a radical Islamic threat being seeded in the US, Johnson has been able to maneuver the attention of Republicans away from his betrayal.While the Republican Party has sought to distance itself from the neocon influence that thrust itself into ruin following the end of the Bush administration, especially under its supposed embrace of populism, the hypocritical response of policing free speech in the wake of nationwide protests highlights that is nothing more than a disingenuous re-brand. While Cultural Marxism was once thought to purely be an infiltration of the Democratic Party and liberal institutions, it is now showing signs of having corrupted the Republican Party and conservative institutions as well. Given the charade that is the false dichotomy of our two-party system in which the Democrats and Republicans serve as nothing more than factions of a uniparty, Soros' influence over both, indirect or otherwise, should come as no surprise. His manipulation of politicians once thought to oppose his globalist aims by influencing them to use the guise of antisemitism to undermine civil liberties has little-to-nothing to do with protecting Jewish lives. Instead, it has everything to do with destroying American values.

2024-04-28 23:15:00,'FX Vigilantes' Strike - Yen Suddenly Crashes To April 1990 Lows Against The Dollar,https://web.archive.org/web/20240429125225/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/fx-vigilantes-strike-yen-suddenly-crashes-april-1990-lows-against-dollar,"The yen crashed in early Asia trading,tumbling to match is exact lows from April 1990in what is being blamed on a 'fat finger' trade or multiple barrier-option trades being triggered, by sources that have literally no idea.

The plunge extended Friday's big drop which followedBoJ Governor Ueda's apparent lack of interest in doing anything about the yen's decline, claiming it had 'no impact' on the currency's inflation picture.

“Currency rates is not a target of monetary policy to directly control,”he said.

“But currency volatility could be an important factorin impacting the economy and prices. If the impact on underlying inflation becomes too big to ignore, it may be a reason to adjust monetary policy.”

In fact,policymakers have repeatedly warned that depreciation won’t be tolerated if it goes too far too fast.

Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki reiterated after the BoJ meeting that the government will respond appropriately to foreign exchange moves.

Potential triggers for interventions are public holidays in Japan on Monday and Friday next week, which bring the risk of volatility amid thin trading.

“Should the yen fall further from here, like after the BOJ decision in September 2022, the possibility of intervention will increase,” said Hirofumi Suzuki, chief currency strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.

“It is not the level but it’s the speed that will trigger the action.”

Well currency volatility is what he has now...

The sudden drop pushed USDJPY perfectly to its April 1990 highs to the tick...

The currency pain was all focused in the Japanese market as EUR and GBP strengthened against the USD...

Perhaps even more notably, the yen puked relative to the Chinese yuan, hitting 22 for the first time since 1992 and putting further pressure on Beijing to potentially do something...

The question is, of course, what will Japan's MoF/BoJ do now - if anything as their recent excuses about 'velocity' or some such spin are now out of the window after a 6-handle standalone surge in their currency in a few short days (when the rest of the world's currencies are not).

“Authorities may say they don’t target levels per se, but they do pay close attention to the trend and the rate of change and current levels suggest they have to act soon or risk facing a credibility crisis,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group Ltd.

“The FX market is almost taking them on like the bond vigilantes of old.”

Specifically asSocGen's FX strategist Kit Juckes noted on Friday,the yen's decline is becoming disorderly, which points to a final, potentially sharp, decline before it finds a floor.

However, as we detailed last week,the problem with intervention is that once the genie is out of the bottle… it’s hard to put it back in.

In other words, the onus should be on the BOJ to step in with a much more hawkish move than the market expects.

As Viraj Patel from Vanda Research goes on to note that ""we’re at a stage where MoF/BoJ have no choice but to intervene. The best way would be for BoJ to hike 25bps this week. It’s not about the macro anymore (BoJ should’ve normalized policy faster last year).""

Instead, what is going on is that Japan's disastrous handling of its currency has evolved into a game between speculators and officials: Specs are short yen for good fundamental reasons (carry).At this stage, a “surprise” hike to send a signal to markets that they are concerned about ongoing FX weakness (and don’t test us) would be less costly to the economy vs. a further devaluation in the yen.It also adds an additional level of uncertainty to the BoJ/MoF reaction function - which speculators (long carry trades) don’t like.

Meanwhile, FX intervention - which unfortunately looks to be the MoF/BoJ’s preferred route based on recent history - is not even a short-term fix anymore.USD/JPY dips would be quickly bought into based on recent market chatter. A hike goes a bit further towards solving the root cause of yen weakness - even it’s only a marginally better option.

However, not everyone is convinced intervention is imminent.

In a note late last week, Deutsche Bank says the currency's decline is warranted andfinally marks the day where the market realizes that Japan is following a policy of benign neglect for the yen.

We have long argued that FX intervention is not credible and the toning down of verbal jawboning from the finance minister overnight is on balance a positive from a credibility perspective. The possibility of intervention can't be ruled out if the market turns disorderly, but it is also notable that Governor Ueda played down the importance of the yen in his press conference today as well as signalling no urgency to hike rates. We would frame the ongoing yen collapse around the following points.

Yen weakness is simply not that bad for Japan.The tourism sector is booming, profit margins on the Nikkei are soaring and exporter competitiveness is increasing. True, the cost of imported items is going up. But growth is fine, the government is helping offset some of the cost via subsidies and core inflation is not accelerating. Most importantly, the Japanese are huge foreign asset owners via Japan’s positive net international investment position. Yen weakness therefore leads to huge capital gains on foreign bonds and equities, most easily summarized in the observation that the government pension fund (GPIF) has roughly made more profits over the last two years than the last twenty years combined.

There simply isn't an inflation problem.Japan's core CPI is around 2% and has been decelerating in recent months. The Tokyo CPI overnight was 1.7% excluding one-off effects. To be sure, inflation may well accelerate again helped by FX weakness and high wage growth. But the starting point of inflation is entirely different to the post-COVID hiking cycles of the Fed and ECB. By extension, the inflation pain is far less and the urgency to hike far less too. No where is this more obvious than the fact that Japanese consumer confidence are close to their cycle highs.

Negative real rates are great.There is a huge attraction to running negative real rates for the consolidated government balance sheet. As we demonstrated last year, it creates fiscal space via a $20 trillion carry trade while also generating asset gains for Japan's wealthy voting base. This encourages the persistent domestic capital outflows we have been highlighting as a key driver of yen weakness over the last year and that have pushed Japan's broad basic balance to being one of the weakest in the world. It is not speculators that are weakening the yen but the Japanese themselves.

The bottom line, Deutscxhe concludes, is thatfor the JPY to turn stronger the Japanese need to unwind their carry trade.But for this to make sense the Bank of Japan needs to engineer an expedited hiking cycle similar to the post-COVID experiences of other central banks. Time will tell if the BoJ is moving too slow and generating a policy mistake.A shift in BoJ inflation forecasts to well above 2% over their forecast horizon would be the clearest signal of a shift in reaction function. But this isn’t happening now.

The Japanese are enjoying the ride.

Finally, it goes without saying that the only true circuit-breaker for yen weakness islower US yields/weak US macro,which is unlikely until the election if, as so many now speculate, therehas been a directive by the Biden admin to make the economy look as good as possible ahead of the elections, even if that means manipulating the data to a grotesque degree.

One added complexity for MoF/BoJ is that their two options for tackling yen weakness indirectly adds upward pressure to global rates/yields. They’re caught between a rock and a hard place… and speculators know (enjoy) this.

And finally there is China: the longer BOJ/MoF does nothing to curb the collapse of the yen, a move which is seen a pumping up the country's exporting base at the expense of other mercantilist nations such as China, the higher the probability Beijing will retaliate against Tokyo by devaluing its own currency.At which point all hell will break loose.

But, one way or another,as Goldman noted,it's crunch time for USDJPY.

2024-04-29 02:00:00,Ukraine's Top Five Challenges Are Unsolvable,https://web.archive.org/web/20240429125225/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/ukraines-top-five-challenges-are-unsolvable,"Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

It’s beginning to dawn on most Westerners that theUS’ long-delayed aid to Ukraineisn’t all that it was hyped up to be and will only at most temporarily slow down the pace of Russia’s increasingly rapid advances. The conflict’s tempo has gradually intensified as Russia exploitedUkraine’s disastrous counteroffensiveto regain the military-strategic initiative.Ukraine’s problems are immense and multifaceted, but they’re all connected one way or another to the five following factors:

Russia won the “race of logistics”/“war of attrition” with NATO long ago and that’s why it continued gaining ground over the past 18 months. The sanctions failed to bankrupt the Kremlin, required resources for production remain readily available, and sabotage had no impact on the assembly lines. Not only has NATO been unable to stop Russia’s military-industrial complex, but it couldn’t ramp up its own during this time either, thus creating an unbridgeable gap that weakens Ukraine more by the week.

NATO’s loss in the abovementioned military-industrial competition with Russia, the consequent failure of Ukraine’s counteroffensive, and Russia’s subsequent on-the-ground gains combined to scare Ukrainian men away from joining the armed forces and helping to replenish their depleted ranks. Without enough soldiers, Ukraine can’t confidently hold off Russia’s advances, thus risking an impending collapse along the front. At the end of the day, it’s just a numbers game, and Ukraine’s continue trending downward.

The pace with which Russia has recently gained ground in Donbass is stressing Ukraine’s existing defensive lines like never before, thus compelling it to build newer ones further behind the front lines. Although Zelenskydemandedthis be done late last year, little progress has been made due to the lack of equipment and troops for holding off the Russian advance while simultaneously accomplishing this task. The breakthrough that theUkrainian Intelligence Committeewarned about is now more likely than ever.

The Committee also warned in their same message from February that political unrest might explode next month around the time that Zelensky’s term expires on 21 May. They of course claimed that Russia would be behind it, which he alsopreconditioned his partnersto falsely believe late last year, but this would actually be a genuine response to growing problems. Authoritarianism, corruption, forcible conscription, serious economic troubles, and the lack of a realistic endgame all enrage Ukrainians.

The Washington Post’stwo-partpost-mortem report on last summer’s failed counteroffensive revealed that one of the reasons why it flopped was because Ukraine refused to listen to the US’ advice. This problem is attributable to Zelensky and most recently took the form of him ordering his forces to attack Russian energy infrastructurein defiance of the USat the expense ofmore tactically significant targets. It’s actually the US’ own fault, though, since their media convinced him that he was a “god among men”.

These unsolvable challenges have converged to create a full-fledged crisis for Ukraine that Commander-in-Chief Syrsky is unable to resolve,which is why hecandidly informedUkraine’s partners that “the difficult operational and strategic situation…has a tendency to get worse.” Unless Ukraine agrees to demilitarize the regions still under its control east of the Dnieper andturn them into a buffer zone, the front might collapse by summertime, which could either lead to capitulation or aNATO intervention.

2024-04-29 02:45:00,Who's In Favor Of A Potential TikTok Ban?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240429125225/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/whos-favor-potential-tiktok-ban#comment-stream,"As part of a larger national security and foreign aid package, President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed into law legislation that forces TikTok parent ByteDance to divest the U.S. arm of its popular social media platform within 270 days or be banned from operating in the United States.The “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act” seeks to cut any ties betweenTikTok, its current parent company and the Chinese government, which allegedly abuses the platform to “surveil and influence the American public” in a way that poses a threat to national security.

As Statista's Felix Richter reports,compared to an earlier standalone bill that had passed the House in March but then failed to gain traction in the Senate, the newly passed billextends the time given to ByteDance from 180 to 270 days, with the possibility of a 90-day extensionif the president finds that significant progress towards a “qualified divesture” has been made. This means that TikTok’s Chinese owner now has until after the U.S. presidential election to find a suitable buyer, turning the question of whether or not TikTok should be divested or banned into a potential election issue.

Sure enough, former president Donald Trump told young voters to remember that“crooked Joe Biden is responsible for banning TikTok,”when they vote in November, omitting the fact thathe tried to ban TikTok himself during his time in office.

And while Trump was right in his view that young Americans would be more likely to oppose legislation against TikTok, he ignored the fact that thevast majority of Republican voters is in favor of a potential ban.According to a recentYouGov/The Economist survey, two thirds of Republicans strongly or somewhat approve the forced divesture/potential ban of TikTok versus just 20 percent who oppose such legislation. Democratic voters are almost evenly split on the issue, with 40 percent of respondents in favor of legislative action against TikTok and its parent company.

Looking at different age groups, the trend is clear: the younger the respondents the more likely they are to oppose a potential TikTok ban, which is easily explained by the fact that young people aremuch more likely to be TikTok users.

You will find more infographics atStatista

So what happens next?

If ByteDance fails to find a suitable buyer within the given timeframe, it would be unlawful for app stores and web hosting companies to distribute the app in the United States.

Finding a buyer will be hard though, as any company with an interest and deep-enough pockets to acquire a platform of TikTok's stature will almost certainly face intense scrutiny from the FTC for antitrust reasons.

It's also unlikely that ByteDance will go down without a fight.

""Rest assured, we aren't going anywhere,""TikTok CEO Shou Chew said in a video posted on Wednesday,claiming that the ultimate goal of the legislation is to ban TikTok, not sell it.

""We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,""he said, addressing the platform's 170 million U.S. users directly.

2024-04-29 03:30:00,'Environmental Pollutant' - How A Key Climate Agenda Tool Harms Endangered Species,https://web.archive.org/web/20240429125225/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/environmental-pollutant-how-key-climate-agenda-tool-harms-endangered-species#comment-stream,"Authored by Donna Anderson via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

As the Biden administration expands its offshore wind projects as part of its goal to reach a carbon-free energy system, whales and other marine life may become collateral damage,according to new research.

Two independent studies measuring ocean wind turbine construction noise found that the sound emitted by vessels mapping the seafloor was significantly louder than estimated, and that noise protection for whales and other sea creatures during wind turbine pile driving doesn’t work.

Intense noise causes hearing loss in whales, other marine mammals, turtles, and fish, compromising their ability to navigate, avoid danger, detect predators, and find prey, according to scientific studies.

Robert Rand, an acoustics consultant with 44 years of experience, took underwater readings of the sonar survey vessel Miss Emma McCall off the coast of New Jersey. He also recorded acoustic readings of pile driving for Vineyards Wind 1, an offshore wind farm project under construction 15 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard.

In hispile-driving report, published March 28, Mr. Rand found that even the most advanced sound-dampening technologies didn’t adequately control harmful noise. The pounding was just as loud as seismic air gun arrays used for oil and gas exploration, long known to cause injury, hearing loss, and behavioral changes in fish and marine mammals.

Furthermore, the noise made by the construction vessel itself, which is not monitored, was almost as loud as the pile driving. Mr. Rand found that the standard formula used by the National Marine Fisheries Service to calculate how noise, over a period of time, affects a mammal’s hearing, significantly underestimates the sound levels experienced by dolphins and whales.

“These are real data,”Mr. Rand, who testified at a Congressional field hearing on January 20, told The Epoch Times. “I measured it. This is not a computer model. This is not a political press release. These are data.”

Many environmentalists fear that noise related to ocean wind farm construction is contributing to “unusual mortality events” affecting whales. From 2016 through April this year, 220 humpback whales have died, according todatacollected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

“Elevated humpback whale mortalities have occurred along the Atlantic coast from Maine through Florida,” since 2016, the NOAAstates.

The NOAA also reported an “unusual mortality event” for North Atlantic right whales, in which 126 have died since 2017.

“The numbers have been decreasing, especially since 2017, when offshore operations really swung into gear,” Mr. Rand said.

“From my experience in noise control, that’s not a coincidence. Noise is an environmental pollutant. In human terms, it’s measured in life years lost.”

The North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium estimates 350 North Atlantic right whales exist in the world’s oceans today.

On Nov. 2, 2023, Mr. Rand went out on a 29-foot sport fishing boat to the Vineyard Wind 1 construction site.

The completed wind farm project will comprise 62 wind turbines in the Atlantic Ocean, spaced one nautical mile apart. The project is estimated to provide power to more than 400,000 homes and businesses.

The offshore wind farm is owned by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners of Denmark and Avangrid Renewables, part of the Spanish company, Iberdrola.

At the construction site in November 2023, Mr. Rand said an 874-foot crane ship called the Orion was using a massive hammer to pound a monopile foundation for a wind turbine into the seabed.

The monopile is a steel pipe 31 feet in diameter, 279 feet long, and weighs 1,895 tons, according to the manufacturer, EEW Special Pipe Constructions.

Vineyard Wind 1 implemented two sets of noise controls. The first is a “hydro sound damper,”which Mr. Rand said, is a vertical net in the water around the monopile that’s covered with foam or rubber blocks and balls.

The second is a “double bubble” curtain. These are two weighted hoses lying on the seafloor in concentric circles around the monopile. The radius is roughly 492 to 656 feet.

The hoses have holes in them, and compressed air from a support vessel is forced through the hoses, causing bubbles to rise to the surface. The bubbles are supposed to mitigate the sound pressure created by the pile driving.

“These are advanced techniques,” Mr. Rand said. “They aren’t used anywhere else.”

Unfortunately, the noise mitigation techniques don’t work, he said.

Mr. Rand dropped a research-grade, omnidirectional hydrophone into the water at six locations, starting at 4.10 nautical miles from the pile driving and moving closer to 0.57 nautical miles.

Analyzing the data, Mr. Rand found that even with sophisticated noise mitigation in place, the pile driving is as loud as multiple seismic air guns.

“People have been protesting and the government has been rigorously regulating seismic air gun arrays for years, if not decades, because of their sonic intensity and hazard for endangered species—for whales and other marine species,” Mr. Rand said.

“This pile driving is as loud as an array of air guns.”

Almost as if all of us Austrian Economists (read: any carbon based life form using common sense when it comes to finance) live in an echo chamber together, athirdexpert I respect came out over the last few days and has warned that 5% on the 10 year treasury would be the breaking point for markets and the economy.

If my calculations are correct, when this thing hits 5%…you’re going to see some serious shit.

Peter Schiffnow arguesthat the Federal Reserve and US Treasury are being forced to confront the reality that inflation is persistent, which has led to an increase in yields, recently reaching 4.7% on the 10 year, the highest since November.

The thought process, for financial neophytes, is that bond traders will continue to sell bonds, driving yields up, in order to make it difficult for the Fed to cut rates — and essentially forcing the Fed to fight inflation head-on instead of capitulating to the economy and markets (should they crash).

This follows Jack Boroudjian’s analysis from last week, stating that rates will keep drifting higher and that 5% to 5.5% is the danger zone:Yields To Trigger ""Serious Earthquakes"" Across Economy: Jack Boroudjian

It also follows Harris Kupperman’s similar take:Bond Market About To Have An ""Aneurism"": Harris Kupperman

Put simply, the Fed faces a dilemma: it needs to raise rates to combat inflation and make Treasuries more appealing, but higher rates would exacerbate the already burdensome debt servicing costs and threaten industries reliant on borrowing.

Or, to use the parlance ofmy recent interview with Matt Taibbi, higher rates simply serve up another day of “shit burgers” to the economy, whereas lower rates act as rocket fuel for economic activity (and market confidence).

Schiff warned last week that once the 10-year Treasury yield surpasses 5%, it enters perilous territory for debt-dependent sectors like automotive and commercial real estate. He writes...(READ THIS FULL ARTICLE HERE).

If anybody remembers the opening  segment from the Will Smith zombie apocalypse flick I Am Legend, it starts with a comically ironic scene wherein a precocious female scientist, endearingly played by Emma Thompson proudly announces a “cure for cancer” that involves reprogramming the measles virus to act more beneficially toward its human host – thereby eradicating cancer cells, and thus, the disease itself:

'In mice, it stopped cancer occurring in 50% of cases'.NHS GP and author, Dr. Renee Hoenderkamp, explains the early stages of a groundbreaking cancer jab.📺 Freeview 236, Sky 512, Virgin 604pic.twitter.com/zzLf5N2w5G

The scene cuts… to the apocalyptic fall of New York City, which we learn is occurring globally because that cancer cure didn’t actually cure cancer – it instead turned into a contagious virus (stop me if you’ve heard this one before), and wiped out 90% of the population. Then it turned most of the survivors into zombies.

The movie is itself a reboot of the 1971 film “Omega Man” starring Charleston Heston, and both are based on the 1954 Richard Matheson novel  titled “I Am Legend”.

When I saw a tweet from the Right Said Fred guys this morning, I could not get over how uncannily this real world clip of a female scientist extolling the benefits of an MRNA vaccine that cured cancer in mice rhymed with the Hollywood dramatization years earlier:

Once again I’ll pass, but thanks for the heads up.https://t.co/KTGClnOKnM

Here we have British writer and GP, Dr. Renee Hoenderkamp, who could easily be cast as Emma Thompson in any ensuing biopic, describing a process of taking the “technology learned from Covid” and repurposing it to kill cancel cells within the human body.

So far they’ve been testing it on mice with a 50% success rate.

Interviewer:So, is this as big as it sounds?

Hoenderkamp:I think it potentially is. I mean, it’s very early days. So basically they’ve discovered that if they use the same technology that they use for COVID, and they use some mRNA, which is a messenger part of DNA, they take your particular cancer, they biopsy it, they take some of the protein on your cancer, and they put it back into your cells, and they tell your cells to make that protein.

The idea is that your body then makes antibodies against it. It gets the memory cells, the t cells, the ones we heard about, lots in COVID. And so then after you’ve been treated for your cancer, if any of those cells are still floating around, or if any of them start to come back and multiply, your own immune system will recognize them from that vaccine and kill it.

We all know what happened next in “I Am Legend”:

Basically, this 👇https://t.co/vWK4U67Poq

It’s odd how life seems to be imitating art, specifically, zombie apocalypse flicks (butonly for anti-vaxxer nut-jobs, apparently).

(Also worth noting that the Bill Gates, and sundry globalists planto spray aerosols into the atmosphereto slow global warming is the exact setup and premise of   “Highlander II: The Quickening“,  the  sequel to the earlier movie albeit a box office flop).

We know from two years of Covid malfeasance (not to mention other mass scale bunglings) that whatever our technocratic overlords dream up in order to usher in utopia, the unintended consequences will dwarf their ability to cope and push us all further intoThe Jackpot(defined as a period of rolling catastrophes and never-ending crises that began in earnest with the 2019 lab leak that ignited the pandemic).

My next e-bookThe CBDC Survival Guide: Navigating Monetary Apartheidwill be out soon (honest), sign up forThe Bombthrower mailing listand I’ll let you know when it drops – and get a copy of theThe Crypto Capitalist Manifestoin the meantime.

2024-04-29 07:45:00,Tesla Jumps After China Greenlights Full-Self Driving With Baidu,https://web.archive.org/web/20240429125225/https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/tesla-jumps-after-china-greenlights-full-self-driving-baidu#comment-stream,"Tesla shares jumped in premarket trading in New York afterBloombergreported that Beijing had given Tesla the 'greenlight' to roll out its driver-assistance system, known as ""Full Self-Driving,"" or FSD, in the world's largest car market.

Sources say Tesla will partner with Chinese tech giant Baidu for mapping and navigation software to support FSD. Tesla also has multiple data security and privacy requirements that satisfy the country's regulators.

In a separate report, The Wall Street Journal said, ""Beijing has tentatively approved the company's plan to launch FSD.""

The approval comes one day after Elon Muskunexpectedly visited Beijingon Sunday and met with Premier Li Qiang, who was previously the Communist Party chief in Shanghai when Tesla was setting up its automobile manufacturing plant there.

WSJ said Musk also met with Robin Zeng, chairman of Tesla battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology, in Beijing.

Wedbush Securities senior analyst Dan Ives told Bloomberg TV that Musk's weekend visit to China was a major ""watershed moment.""

""This could open up FSD in China, which I view as unlocking what really could be the golden opportunity for them,"" Ives said.

FSD approval in China would be a massive win for Tesla, given the company's year-over-year decline inquarterly revenuesince 2020. The worsening EV price war with other EV makers and legacy automakers, in addition to high interest rates curbing demand, has forced the company to reduce its global headcount by 10%.

News of China's backing of FSD sent Tesla shares up 8% in premarket trading in New York.

As of Friday's close, shares are down 32% this year, while 3.84% of the float is short, equivalent to about 106 million shares. Short interest has hit a three year high.

On an earnings call last week, Musk said, ""We plan on, with the approval of the regulators, releasing it as a supervised autonomy system in any market that — where we can get regulatory approval for that, which we think includes China.""

2024-04-29 08:23:57,"Futures Rise, Yen Downgraded To Banana Republic Currency After Another Rollercoaster Session",https://web.archive.org/web/20240429125225/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/futures-rise-yen-downgraded-banana-republic-currency-after-another-rollercoaster-session#comment-stream,"US equity futures swung between gains and losses and traded near session highs as US traders walked to their desks on Monday morning after a rollercoaster day for the Japanese yen, which increasingly looks like some 3rd world banana republic currency instead of belonging to the world's 3rd largest economy, and which first plunged below 160 vs the USD - the lowest level since 1990 amid dismal volumes thanks to the Japanese market holiday on Monday - only to soar more than 500 pips in what is now the firstconfirmed BOJ interventionsince 2022. Futures were buoyed by rising earnings optimism as traders looked ahead to another very busy week for company results, and as of 7:40am, S&P futures gained 0.2% with Nasdaq futures rising 0.3%, boosted by another surge in Tesla shares.  10Y Treasury yields fell four basis points to 4.62% ahead of today's announcement by the Treasury of its funding needs for the coming quarter, while the dollar weakened. Oil retreated, with Brent first trading below $89 a barrel, only to rebound higher amid the endless speculation that a peace deal between Israel and Hamas is coming that would reduce geopolitical tensions in the Middle East (spoiler alert: there will be no deal). Gold rose and bitcoin fell.

In premarket trading, Tesla surged 11%, slamming the recent pile up of shorts (the biggest in two years) as Elon Musk’s quick visit to China paid immediate dividends, with Tesla receiving in-principle approval from government officials to deploy its driver-assistance system in the world’s biggest auto market.

Here are some other premarket movers:

The big overnight market event was the rollercoaster move in the Japanese yen which again took center stage with dramatic moves that fueled speculation over whether the government had intervened to support its beleaguered currency. In holiday-thinned trading, the yen swung wildly, rallying more than 2% on Monday after earlier dropping as much as 1.2% to 160.17 per dollar.

While analysts suggested the size and speed of the jump smacked of intervention, some traders questioned that conclusion and said Japanese banks sold dollars for customers as it rallied. Japan’s top currency official, Masato Kanda, chose to keep investors guessing by declining to comment. Dow Jones reported authorities stepped in to support the yen, citing people familiar with the matter.

It is a busy week: the Fed meeting on Wednesday and US jobs report on Friday will also be critical for markets this week. The last time Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke, he signaled that policymakers were likely to keep borrowing costs high for longer than previously anticipated, pointing to the lack of further progress on bringing inflation down, and to enduring strength in the labor market. Meanwhile, with Apple and Amazon.scheduled to report in the next few days, investors will be hoping for more evidence that big technology profits can keep propelling stocks.

Morgan Stanley’s in house permabear Michael Wilson said the pressure from higher Treasury yields is taking the shine off an upbeat earnings season; that's even as Bloomberg data showed that 81% of S&P 500 firms have beaten first-quarter profit estimates so far. Still, as we notedover the weekend, the average stock price has barely outperformed the benchmark index on the day of results — the worst scorecard since the fourth quarter of 2020, the figures showed.

European stocks are higher, the Stoxx 600 rising 0.3% to 509.7, with Dutch medtech Philips the biggest stand-out performer, rising the most on record after striking a settlement related to a device recall; Deutsche Bank was the biggest decliner after making €1.3 billion of provisions, with its country peer Porsche falling too, following its latest earnings. Here are the biggest movers Monday:

Meanwhile, Asian equities climbed for a second straight day, as benchmarks for mainland and Hong Kong stocks looked set to enter a bull market. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 0.3%, with AIA Group and TSMC among the top contributors to the gains. The MSCI China Index and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index were both on track to close more than 20% higher than their January lows, helped by a surge in property shares after a major Chinese developer reached a solution with bondholders for its liquidity issues.

“China may continue to outperform especially in a scenario where global risk sentiment remains cautious,” Nomura strategists including Chetan Seth wrote in a note. “Fundamentals remain tepid” and economic data in the next couple of months are important to avoid a reversal of recent gains, they added. Benchmarks in Taiwan, the Philippines and South Korea also advanced on Monday. Markets in Japan and Vietnam were closed for holidays.

In FX, the yen rallied to a 155 handle versus the dollar, having earlier weakened past 160 for the first time since 1990. The abrupt swing prompted speculation authorities may have intervened, although Japan’s top currency official has declined to comment even as Dow confirmed intervention. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is down 0.3% as the greenback loses ground versus all its G-10 rivals.

In rates, treasuries climbed with US 10-year yields falling 4bps to 4.62%, with gains supported by euro-zone bond markets, particularly France’s, outperforming after Moody’s and Fitch affirmed the sovereign’s rating Friday. April inflation numbers from Germany and Spain were taken in stride.  US yields richer by 2bp to 4bp across the curve with long-end-led gains flattening 2s10s, 5s30s spreads by 1.5bp and 0.5bp on the day; 10-year remains near session low around 4.625% with bunds outperforming by around 1.5bp in the sector, French 10-year by ~3bp. On Wednesday, Treasury announces quarterly refunding, expected to follow through on its January guidance of holding off on further increases

Oil prices are lower as the US pushes to broker a peace deal between Israel and Hamas. WTI falls 0.2% to trade near $83.70. Spot gold is little changed around $2,338/oz.

Monday’s US session has few calendar events. US economic data slate includes April Dallas Fed manufacturing activity at 10:30am New York time; ahead this week are consumer confidence, ADP employment change, manufacturing PMI, ISM manufacturing, factory orders and April jobs report. Fed members are in self-imposed quiet period ahead of May 1 policy announcement.

APAC stocks began the week on the front foot after the tech-led surge last Friday on Wall St and amid increased optimism regarding a Gaza truce with negotiators set for talks in Cairo on Monday, although Japan was on holiday and ahead of this week's key risk events.ASX 200 was led higher by real estate, tech and telecoms owing to softer yields. Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp. gained with the former entering into bull market territory after climbing over 20% from its January lows, while participants digested a slew of earnings and the mainland also shrugged off the slowdown in March Industrial Profits.

European bourses, Stoxx600 (+0.3%) are almost entirely in the green, taking the lead from a positive APAC session overnight. Trade has been rangebound since the open, though has just been coming off best levels in recent trade.Basic Resources is found towards the top of the pile, benefiting from modestly firmer base metal prices and after further takeover reports regarding BHP/Anglo American. Retail marginally underperforms. US Equity Futures (ES +0.2%, NQ +0.3%, RTY +0.3%) are entirely in the green, posting modest gains in tandem with European peers. In terms of pre-market movers; Apple (+1.5%) gains on reports that it has resumed talks with OpenAI. And Tesla (+6.5%) benefits from news that the Co. has received tentative approval for its self-driving service.

DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap

I wrote some of this while supervising my three kids doing their homework this weekend. The 6yr old twins had fractions and adverbs, with the latter being pretty challenging. They had a whole story where they had to insert missing adverbs. It was incredibly, astonishingly, extremely, exceedingly, enormously, supremely, difficult. So if you see a few stray adverbs below it's because I've been swimming in them this weekend.

With just two days left of a difficult April for markets, last week actually saw the best week for the S&P 500 (+2.67%) and NASDAQ (+4.23%) since November as earnings generally gave markets a boost even if the US inflation data was net net worrying. You’ll see our full recap of last week towards at the end but looking forward first it's an exceptionally busy week of important events.

The FOMC conclusion on Wednesday is the obvious highlight (full preview below) but we also have payrolls on Friday to look forward to. DB expect a more hawkish-leaning Fed this week. While our economists expect the Committee will maintain an easing bias (preview here), they do expect the statement and press conference to echo Chair Powell’s view that firmer inflation prints suggest it will take longer to gain confidence about disinflation. The press conference will be fascinating to see the nuances in Powell’s responses as he justifies a likely unchanged easing bias, even if the rhetoric is more hawkish, in the face of rising inflation.

In terms of the jobs report on Friday, our US economists see payrolls gaining +240k in April (consensus +250k), down from +303k in March. The consensus expects the unemployment rate and the hourly earnings growth rate to stay at 3.8% and +0.3% MoM, respectively, although DB expects the former to tick up a tenth. Overall the market sees a solid report.

Other key data in the US includes consumer confidence tomorrow, the manufacturing ISM, JOLTS, and ADP on Wednesday, and the services ISM on Friday. We also see the latest US Treasury quarterly refunding announcement on Wednesday, after the borrowing estimate is due today. This was a big pivot point for global markets back in August (negative) and October (positive) but since then a commitment not to increase auction sizes has reduced its importance. Our strategists preview the event and detail their estimates here. Finally in the US, earnings season maintains its peak pace as 174 report in the S&P versus 180 last week with Amazon (Tuesday) and Apple (Thursday) the obvious highlights. Meanwhile, 66 Stoxx 600 companies will report this week.

In Europe, preliminary CPI reports for Germany and Spain today, and the Eurozone tomorrow will have a lot of significance for the June ECB meeting and whether we will see the first cut. Our European economists preview the release here. For the Eurozone, they expect the headline HICP to fall one-tenth to 2.31% yoy, its lowest value since August 2021 and see core inflation slowing further to 2.45% yoy, 0.50pp lower than in March 2024. Staying in Europe the latest GDP data for Germany, France, Italy and the Eurozone are due tomorrow. In Asia, various China PMIs (tomorrow) will be a big focus and in Japan, several key economic indicators are also due, including industrial production and labour market data tomorrow.

The day-by-day calendar at the end as usual gives a more detailed diary of the main events this coming week.

Asian equity markets have started the week on a positive note extending Friday’s rally on Wall Street. Chinese stocks are the best performers across the region with the Hang Seng (+1.93%) leading gains followed by the CSI (+1.63%) and the Shanghai Composite (+0.94%), buoyed by a rally in property stocks after embattled property developer CIFI Holdings reached a solution with bondholders on a plan to restructure its offshore debt. Elsewhere, the KOSPI (+0.91%) is also trading higher while stock markets in Japan are closed for a public holiday, also meaning no cash Treasury trading as yet. S&P 500 (+0.25%) and NASDAQ 100 (+0.34%) futures are edging higher.

In FX, the Japanese yen remained under pressure as it weakened past 160 earlier (from just below 158 at the open), its weakest level since 1990. This was in thin holiday trading and it's subsequently bounced back to below 156. So some astonishing moves this morning!

Over the weekend, China’s industrial profits fell -3.5% in March (YoY) and have now risen + 4.3% y/y in the first quarter, significantly down from a +10.2% expansion in the January-February period, thus still pointing to challenges for China even with a better outlook of late.

Recapping last week now, the US March PCE inflation came in line with expectations on Friday at +0.3% month-on-month, allowing markets to breathe a slight sigh of relief compared to the strong Q1 PCE deflator in the GDP data the day before. In year-on-year terms, the March PCE release came in just above expectations at +2.7% (vs 2.6% expected). The month-on-month core print was also in line with consensus at +0.3%, and at +2.8% year-on-year (vs 2.7% expected). The March data also pointed to a still vibrant US consumer, with real personal spending up +0.5% on the month (vs +0.3% expected).

With the PCE print largely in line with expectations, US equities rallied, with the S&P 500 rising +1.02% on Friday. A strong performance by the tech giants following strong Q1 results from Alphabet (+10.22%) and Microsoft (+1.82%) the previous evening saw the Magnificent Seven post their best day in two months (+3.27%). After three weeks of consecutive losses, both the S&P 500 (+2.67%) and the NASDAQ (+4.23%) saw their largest weekly gains since last November. Even as technology spearheaded the rally, the gains were broad-based, as the Russell 2000 index rose +2.79% (and +1.05% on Friday). European equities also advanced, with the STOXX 600 up +1.74% last week (and +1.11% on Friday). The FTSE 100 hit another record high after gaining +3.09% (and +0.75% on Friday).

Friday’s PCE print did little to reverse expectations for fewer Fed rate cuts this year. The number of cuts anticipated by the December meeting was unchanged on Friday (+0.1bps) but down -4.9bps over the week to 34bps, with the decline coming on Thursday following the inflation data within the Q1 GDP release. US Treasuries did see a moderate rally on Friday, as the 2yr and 10yr yields fell -0.3bps and -4.0bps respectively. However, this was insufficient to erase earlier losses with Treasury yields seeing their highest weekly close year-to-date, up +0.9bps to 4.996% for 2yrs and +4.3bps to 4.665% for 10yrs. The story was similar in Europe, as investors dialled back their expectations of ECB rate cuts by -2.2bps on the week to 72bps. This saw 10yr bund yields rise +7.5bps on the week to 2.57%, despite a sizeable recovery on Friday (-5.5bps).

Meanwhile in Asia, the major story last week was the weakening of the Japanese yen. With the Bank of Japan leaving interest rates on hold, alongside restrained commentary on the exchange rate by policymakers, the yen fell -2.33% (and -1.78% on Friday) to 158.33 per dollar, its weakest level since 1990. Against this backdrop, the Nikkei 225 rose +2.34% (and +0.81% on Friday).

Finally in commodities, copper secured its fifth consecutive week of gains after rising +1.48% (and +1.03% on Friday) on the back of growing demand for clean transition metals and tight supply. On the other hand, gold ended its five-week streak of consecutive gains, falling -2.26% (+0.39% on Friday) amid easing geopolitical fears.

2024-04-29 08:26:53,'Anti-White' Scottish First Minister Quits After Disastrous 'Hate Crime Law',https://web.archive.org/web/20240429125225/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/scottish-first-minister-quits-after-disastrous-hate-crime-law#comment-stream,"Scotland's leader Humza Yousaf resigned on Monday,quitting as head of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) after scrapping a coalition agreement with Scotland's Greens. He then failed to secure enough support to survive votes of no confidence against him expected later this week.

Yousaf, born to Pakistani immigrants in Glasgow,built an infamous reputation as a woke activist politician going into the 2023 elections.His rabid pro-immigration stance and consistent arguments in favor of DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) should have been a red flag to the Scottish public; however, with an increasingly progressive voting population Yousaf narrowly scored a victory.Here is Humza in 2020, giving a speech admonishing the ""whiteness"" of the Scottish government.

Scotland’s First Minister is resigning in disgrace.@HumzaYousaf’s legacy includes the hatred of Scottish people, a mainstreaming of American leftist woke politics, and a pro-Gaza foreign policy. His infamous 2020 speech before he was elected:pic.twitter.com/NoPnwosEgC

Keep in mind that Scotland is 96% white.For most people logic would dictate that having a majority white government makes perfect sense given Scotland's demographics.  This is something that Yousef and his progressive ilk have set out to change.

At the beginning of 2024 the former First Minister sought to launch apro-migrant propaganda campaign, claiming that open immigration policies lead to economic benefits for Scotland.  Of course, as with all politicians that make this assertion, he offered no concrete statistics to support the theory.

Beyond his insistence on going against the growing public opposition in Scotland to more migrants being allowed into the country, Yousaf's biggest mistake was the passage of his now wildly unpopular ""Hate Crime Act.""The law which recently went into effect criminalized many forms of speech including criticism or skepticism of gender fluid theory and trans identity.  Misgendering and misuse of a trans person pronouns could now land a Scottish citizen in jail.

In response, the Scottish public flooded law enforcement agencies with fake calls accusing various trans activists and even political leaders of various hate crimes.Police were so overwhelmed by the paperwork that any effort to enforce the law has ground to a halt.

As we have detailed again and again (here,here, andhere), his hate-crime law was an utter disaster - that everyone saw coming - and before his resignation,just 29 per cent of Scottish National Party voters believe Yousaf is doing a good job, while 36 per cent think he has been poor in office.

Consequently, Yousaf’s popularity among his own voters is now minus seven, down from plus 14 in January, a massive drop.

As we have highlighted, under the new ‘hate crime’ legislation, anyone deemed to have been verbally ‘abusive’, in person or online, to a transgender person, including “insulting” them could be hit with a prison sentence of up to seven years.

As a reminder,Police received 8000 ‘hate crime’ complaints in just the first week of the law coming into play,equating to more than the annual total of all hate crime reports for all previous years.

The number is on course to out number the total of all other offences combined.

Calum Steele, the former general secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, declared thatofficers “are genuinely embarrassed,” adding that “They feel that the service and by extension [they] as individual police officers will catch some of the public brunt.”

The hate crime law received backlash from every corner of the UK, including from more liberal personalities like Harry Potter author JK Rowling.

...and now, he's gone!

In an emotional address, Yousef said:

“While a route through this week’s motion of no confidence was absolutely possible,I am not willing to trade my values and principles or do deals with whomever simply for retaining power.

“Therefore, after spending the weekend reflecting on what is best for my party, for the government and for the country I lead I have concluded that repairing our relationship across the political divide can only be done with someone else at the helm.

“Ihave therefore informed the SNP’s national secretary of my intention to stand down as party leaderand ask that she commences a leadership contest for my replacement as soon as possible.”

Scottish leader Humza Yousaf has resigned. Didn't even make it to the election. Tip for future leaders, being racist toward 96% of your country and passing laws outlawing free speech isn't a recipe for success. He'll forever be known as 'Hate Crime Humza'.pic.twitter.com/64JIXQEIQJ

His decision comestwo days after expressly denying that he would resign.

Humza Yousaf has resigned. Good riddance 👋🏽pic.twitter.com/vAJjLzPAMv

Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, said Humza Yousaf made the right decision to resign as Scotland’s First Minister. The Tory Cabinet minister said:

“It was the right thing for the First Minister to resign.

“Humza Yousaf’s leadership has lurched from crisis to crisis from the very start,and he could not command the confidence of the Scottish Parliament.""

But, amid the political division in his coalition, as The Telegraph‘s Gordon Rayner says“Humza Yousaf’s hate crime and trans laws will be his divisive legacy“.

In truth, the public never wanted Mr. Yousaf as First Minister: opinion polls before his election consistently showed that Kate Forbes,his socially conservative rivalfor the leadership, was far more popular with both SNP supporters and voters as a whole.

Humza Yousaf said he will remain as First Minister of Scotland until his successor as SNP leader has been elected.

His answer here is two-fold: on one hand, the lack of rate cuts in itself is not necessarily a game changer, and even in the face of climbing rates, Kostin writes, the S&P 500 has returned 6% this year and is just 4% below its all-time-high of 5254.

2024-04-29 10:00:00,Biden Looks To Prevent Future President From Ending Ukraine War With 10-Year Agreement,https://web.archive.org/web/20240430120643/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/biden-looks-prevent-future-president-ending-ukraine-war-10-year-agreement,"Soon on the heels of President Biden last week signing into law a $61 billion aid package for Ukraine's defense, President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday indicated that he's working with Washington on a bilateral security agreement whichwould last ten years.

""We are already working on a specific text,"" Zelenskysaidin his nightly video address. ""Our goal is to make this agreement the strongest of all.""

""We are discussing the specific foundations of our security and cooperation. We are also working onfixing specific levels of support for this year and the next 10 years.""

He indicated it will likely include agreements on long-term support centering on military hardware and joint arms production, as well as continuing reconstruction aid. ""The agreement should be truly exemplary and reflect the strength of American leadership,"" Zelensky added.

But ultimately a key purpose in locking such a long-term deal in would be to keep itimmune from potential interference by a future Trump administration.

Below is whatThe Wall Street Journalspelled outlast year:

The goal is to make sure Ukraine will be strong enough in the future to deter Russia from attacking it again. More immediately, Ukraine’s Western allies hope todiscourage the Kremlin from thinking it can wait out the Biden administration for a potentially more sympathetic successor in the White House.

Western officials are looking for ways to lock in pledges of support and limit future governments’ abilities to backtrack,amid fears in European capitals that Donald Trump, if he recaptures the White House, would seek to scale back aid. Trump has a wide lead in early polling in the Republican presidential primary field, but soundly lost the 2020 election to President Biden and has been indicted in four criminal cases in state and federal courts.

We and others havepreviously underscoredthat NATO and G7 countries are desperately trying to ""Trump-proof"" future aid to Ukraine and the effort to counter Russia.

As for its first new weapons package in the wake of the $61 billion being authorized, the Biden administration has announced new arms packages totaling $7 billion. The US has vowed to rush the weapons to Kiev, given that by all indicators its forces are not doing well on the frontlines.

""We are still waiting for the supplies promised to Ukraine – we expect exactly the volume and content of supplies that can change the situation on the battlefield in the interests of Ukraine,"" Zelensky had said over the weekend. ""And it is important that every agreement we have reached is implemented – everything that will yield practical results on the battlefield and boost the morale of everyone on the frontline. In a conversation with Mr. Jeffries,I emphasized the need for Patriot systems, they are needed as soon as possible.""

Zelensky announces that Ukraine is working on a security agreement with the U.S. that will fix levels of support for the next 10 years. The $61 billion was just the beginning. The next two U.S. presidents won’t be able to switch it off.pic.twitter.com/q1RWCxf93m

But all of this means the war will be prolonged, and this puts negotiations much further away on the horizon, despite what arenow daily acknowledgementsof Ukraine forces being beaten back. Currently the governments of Greece and Spain are being pressured by EU and NATO leadership to hand over what few Patriot systems they possess to Kiev. The rationale is that they don't need them as urgently as Ukraine does.

2024-04-29 11:58:22,European Union Grabs More Power: Are We Heading Back to a Communist Future?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240430120643/https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2024-04-29/european-union-grabs-more-power-are-we-heading-back-communist-future,"I wrote about this in aprevious issuenot long ago, and my answer was the UN and the pointy shoes in the European Union.

The Spanish government willexpropriate beachfront real estateand “let the owners use it” for 30 years.

The below is translated…

The Government may expropriate apartments, hotels or beach bars on the beach in exchange for granting the owners their use for 30 years and, in certain cases, another 30 extendable years. It will also limit concessions to have an activity near the coast to a maximum of 75 years.

The Ministry for the Ecological Transition is advancing in the new modification of the General Coastal Regulation to alleviate the impact of the advance of the sea, after overturning part of the text by the Supreme Court last January due to a defect during its processing. Therefore, it is expected that the change will follow the same direction as in the last reform in 2022 and will allow the State to expropriate properties and land in areas where water eats up soil. A controversial action for individuals, businessmen and municipalities in which the court did not enter.

The climate hoax is a useful tool used to implement the great reset. Owning property in Spain at this point is, in my opinion, irresponsible.

And to anyone who responds with, “Oh, but I don’t own beachfront real estate,” you are completely missing the point. You really think they’re going to stop there? Good luck to you if you do.

I’ve made this point before that the price variance between say Ibiza and Antalya or Fethiye, where the cost of living is just as nice albeit far cheaper than Ibiza or Mallorca, is anywhere from half the price to about a third of the price. Just saying…

Sticking with theSpaniards…

The PM signaled that his administration would “start the procedure to eliminate the granting of the so-called golden visa, which allows access to the residence regime when more than half a million euros are invested in real estate. We are going to take the necessary measures to guarantee that housing is a right and not a mere speculative business.

That last reference to housing being a “right” is straight out of the idiot’s guide to Marxism.

Imagine a country run as a business, and in this country you invite boat loads (literally) of uneducated folks, almost exclusively men of military age from cultures drastically different and in many instances entirely antithetical to those of the society they now live in. They come predominantly for social benefits. We know this based on the numbers of those still on welfare checks many years after arriving. Cities begin to look like this below (Paris).

While this is going on, you then begin eliminating the incentives to attract capital. Look at the lines on that. No, not that. The Ferrari.

Oh, and to top it all off, you then take large amounts of the tax take and send it into Europe’s laundromat (Ukraine) to ensure the military industrial complex survives and thrives.

What could possibly go wrong?

Fat Propaganda Roundup: Documenting the meatiest, juiciest cuts of “fat acceptance” propaganda from corporate and social media.

Wokeness has ruined cheerleading.pic.twitter.com/d6hj2M65wM

Frankly, this looks like a public safety hazard from multiple angles.

“No cheerleader of mine is ever going to weigh 200 pounds,” my Midwestern Irish-Catholic grandmammy used to quip of her adolescent charges in the Parish Pep Squad as they ran the track on a scorching August day.

“No heifers” was Commandment #1 at the Parish Pep Squad, and it was ironclad.

Mammy entrusted me with the stopwatch operation; if they came in a second over eight minutes on the mile, they had to do it all over. The power was intoxicating.

One young lady collapsed from heat exhaustion.

“We ought to get her to a hospital,” the assistant coach, Mrs. Phelps, pleaded — a real go-gooder, soft-hearted lit teacher.

But my mammy didn’t tolerate weakness; instead, she read a Hail Mary over this girl’s slumped body, crossed herself, and sprayed the melodramatic harlot down something fierce with the much-feared firehouse on loan from the Topeka FD — which she called a tool of “Divine Motivation” — until she got up and finished her laps.

“Jo” (he/they) — a glaringly white, heterosexual-looking male, possible future incel domestic terrorist — found his way into the “Queer Fat Club” Zoom call and informed the visibly disoriented moderator that he identifies as a “fat-bodied person.”

His presence was as well-received — by the allegedly loving and tolerant people who claim to believe anyone can construct any identity they desire at any given time — as one would expect.

If you want to be part of the Queer Fat Club, you really have to be fat. It’s a requirement.pic.twitter.com/TZrrzDSTd7

The problem — well, one of myriad — is that no one in these people’s lives, either online or in-person, ever says any true thing to them, like that having an “fat queer club” is for retarded, narcissistic losers.

No one says these things, even in the most diplomatic terms possible, because anyone that would has been cut out of their lives and/or blocked in Twitter and/or reported to HR.

So it’s left to crafty internet trolls like Jo here to deliver the message in novel and entertaining ways, because people learn best while they’re being entertained.

There has never existed on Earth a more prolific, mega-industrial drug-dealing enterprise as the U.S. government. That’s as true today as it was in the 80s when it shipped crack into the ghetto to fuel its drug war.

Not even the British hooking the Chinese on dope back in the colonial day compares.

ViaCNBC(emphasis added):

“More than 3 million people with Medicare could be eligible for coverage of Wegovy now that the blockbuster weight loss drug is also approved in the U.S. for heart health, according to an analysis released Wednesday by health policy research organization KFF.

But some eligiblebeneficiaries could still face out-of-pocket costsfor the highly popular and expensive drug, KFF said. Certain Medicare prescription drug plans may also wait until 2025 to cover Wegovy.

Medicare’s budget could be strained as more plans cover the costs of Wegovy. The program’s prescription drug plans could spend anadditional net $2.8 billion if just 10% of the eligible population, an estimated 360,000 people,use the drug for a full year, according to KFF.

Under new guidanceissued in March,Medicare Part D plans can cover Wegovy for patients as long as they are obese or overweight, have a history of heart diseaseand are specifically prescribed the weekly injection to reduce their risk of heart attacks and strokes. The Food and Drug Administration approved Wegovy for that purpose in March.

KFF saidthat applies to 3.6 million, or 7%, of total beneficiaries, based on 2020 data. That group also makes up 1 in 4 of the 13.7 million Medicare patients who are obese or overweight. Those numbers may be higher based on more recent data, the nonprofit group said.”

To summarize, 3.6 million obese geriatrics are about to get their guts mangled, succumbing to deadly muscle loss (called sarcopenia; look it up) and all manner of side effects from the drugs, while the public treasure gets pilfered, all for the private benefit of the pharmaceutical industry and its lackeys in the regulatory agencies — plus some generous “brought to you by multinational pharmaceutical corporation x” advertising revenue for the compliant corporate media and sponsorships for the celebrities who market it to the peasants.

2024-04-29 22:30:33,Columbia Begins Suspensions After Demonstrators Ignore 2PM Deadline,https://web.archive.org/web/20240430120643/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/leave-or-be-suspended-columbia-gives-protesters-until-2pm-or-else#comment-stream,"Update (2230ET):Columbia University announced Monday evening thatit has begun suspending studentswho wouldn't leave an pro-Palestine encampment by a 2pm deadline.

Students in the encampment along with hundreds of supporters spent Monday afternoon rallying in support of the movement, however by 4pm most of the protesters began to disperse after there was no sign of police action to arrest protesters or remove tents.Around 80 students remainedby early evening.

And now,they'll be suspended.

""We have begun suspending students as part of the next phase of our efforts to ensure the safety of our campus,"" said University spokesman Ben Chang.

At present,a core group of students remain.

At a news conference on Monday afternoon, Sueda Polat, a student organizer with the encampment, said that the university had not made significant concessions to the protesters’ main demand: divestment from companies with links to the Israeli occupation of Gaza.Columbia had also stopped negotiating. As a result, she said, the students inside the encampment “will not be moved unless by force.”

“We’ve been asked to disperse, but it is against the will of the students to disperse,” she said. “We do not abide by university pressures. We act based on the will of the students.” -NY Times

Earlier in the dayfaculty members, many wearing masks, were getting in on the action.

Let's see what tomorrow brings.

Columbia University has given protesting students until 2pmto leave their encampmentandsign a form committing to abide by university policiesthrough June 30, 2025, or by their graduation. Failure to do so willdisqualify students from graduating this spring, or from participating in academic and extracurricular activities,Axiosreports.

""It is important for you to know that the university has already identified many students in the encampment,"" reads the Monday letter that was shared by Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine. ""If you do not leave by 2pm, you will be suspended pending further investigation.""

ACTION ALERT:- Columbia University admin threatens MASS SUSPENSIONS and DISCIPLINARY PROBATION (until June 2025) to Gaza Solidarity Encampment participants who don’t leave by 2 PM.- Do not sign anything with administration.- Show up at NOON to protect the encampment! ❤️‍🔥pic.twitter.com/v1Qw5gXu0q

""Sanctions include probation, access restriction, suspension for a term or more and expulsion,"" reads the Monday notice - which doesn't look like it's going well.

Columbia University has threatened the students in the Gaza solidarity encampment with mass suspensions if they do not sign waivers by 2pm today. The students’ response:pic.twitter.com/SIJkWJWvji

According to the letter, talks between university leaders and student leaders at the encampmentare at an impasseand the unauthorized encampment and associated disruption to the campus has created an ""unwelcoming environment"" which violates various school policies - including rules governing disruptive behavior and harassment.

""Please promptly gather your belongings and leave the encampment,"" reads the letter. ""If you voluntarily leave by 2 p.m., identify yourself to a University officials, and sign the provided form where you commit to abide by all University policies through June 30, 2025, or the date of the conferral of your degree, whichever is earlier, you will be eligible to complete the semester in good standing (and will not be placed on suspension) as long as you adhere to that commitment.""

Well something is about to go down a Columbia.pic.twitter.com/ws6Ztpw8en

Officials say they hope the protesting students will sign the form and leave by the deadline.Those who refuse will be put on disciplinary probation.

Meanwhile, things are starting to get spicy:

And there he goes.pic.twitter.com/3e0sv1qke5

As theEpoch Timesnotes further, efforts to dismantle the encampment have failed, asuniversity president Minouche Shafik has faced an outcry from many students, faculty, and outside observersfor summoning New York City police to take down the unauthorized encampment, resulting in more than 100 arrests.

Protesters have vowed to keep their encampment unless three demands are met: divestment from Israel, transparency in Columbia’s finances, and amnesty for students and staff disciplined for taking part in the protests.

Ms. Shafik said in her Monday statement thatColumbia would not divest from Israel but that the university has offered to publish a process for students to access a list of its direct investment holdings, in the interest of transparency. Columbia has also offered to make investments in health and education in Gaza. And the letter sent to protesters promises an amnesty of sorts.

She said thatthe campus has been roiled by divisions over the war in Gazaand, despite the fact that the school has provided space for protests and vigils that did not disrupt academic life, the encampment has gone too far.

“We must take into account the rights of all members of our community,” she wrote. “The encampment has created an unwelcoming environment for many of our Jewish students and faculty. External actors have contributed to creating a hostile environment in violation of Title VI, especially around our gates, that is unsafe for everyone—including our neighbors.”

“With classes now concluding, it represents a noisy distraction for our students studying for exams and for everyone trying to complete the academic year,” she continued, adding that Columbia would allow protests to continue on campus—by application with two-days’ notice in authorized locations—after the exam period and commencement.

“We have no intention of suppressing speech or the right to peaceful protest,” Ms. Shafik wrote, adding that the protesting students had been asked to commit to following the university’s rules, including those on the time, place, and manner of demonstrations.

“We urge those in the encampment to voluntarily disperse,” she added.

Various streets are being blocked. Sounds like they are creating a corridor to shuffle the protesters out.pic.twitter.com/vH8WutuQ7O

It comes as a group of 21 House Democrats criticized the “anti-Israel, anti-Jewish” encampment at Columbia in an April 29 letter to the school’s trustees.

“As a result of this disruption on campus, supported by some faculty members, many students have been prevented from safely attending class, the main library, and from leaving their dorm rooms in an apparent violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.”

The group, led by Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), is different from calls condemning the protests that have mostly come from GOP leaders. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Republican colleagues visited the campus last week and called for Ms. Shafik to resign.

USNS Roy P. Benavidez is now some 5 miles from the shoreline location which serves as the base of operations, overseen by the Israeli military.The Associated Presswrites that ""A satellite image from Sunday by Planet Labs PBC showedpieces of the floating pier in the Mediterranean Sea alongside the vessel.""

Both US and Israeli officials have voiced that they hope to have a mobile pier in place and humanitarian deliveries being offloaded via maritime routes by sometime in the first part of May.

The causeway is expected to be at a length of 550-meters (1,800 feet) and will have Israeli military protection. US Army and Navy engineers are expected to remain at sea, especially after days ago the pier site came under mortar shelling by Palestinian militants who have warned against foreign forces stepping foot inside Gaza.

A newReutersreport meanwhile indicates the pier will cost US taxpayers at least $320 million to finish.This is double theearly estimateswhich were floated earlier this year.

""The figure, which has not been previously reported, illustrates the massive scale of a construction effort that the Pentagon has said involves about 1,000 US service members, mostly from the Army and Navy,""writesReuters.

""The cost has not just risen. It has exploded,""Senator Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Democratic-led Senate Armed Services Committee, hascomplained.

""This dangerous effort with marginal benefitwill now cost the American taxpayers at least $320 million [US dollars] to operate the pier for only 90 days,"" he continued.

Earlier this month, USAID director Samantha Power said that famine already exists in some parts of the Gaza Strip. WSJ has underscored this as well in its reportinglast week: ""Some U.S. officials have saidthe pier, which will float several miles off Gaza’s shore, will help get more aid into northern Gaza, where some residents are already living infamine-like conditions, according to estimates released last month by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, an international initiative tasked with assessing the risk of famine around the world.""

Many government officials especially from Global South countries have highlightedWashington's contradictory approach to Gaza- on the one hand the US has been funding the Israeli military machine, sending controversial weaponry like 2,000-pound bombs, while on the other Biden has condemned the soaring civilian death toll and humanitarian catastrophe. Ironically, to some degree the United States is funding both sides of the conflict.

2024-04-29 23:00:00,China & The US: What Matters That's Overlooked,https://web.archive.org/web/20240430120643/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/china-us-what-matters-thats-overlooked#comment-stream,"Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,

Parsing geopolitics is fun but our attention is better directed to the limits and second-order effects of legacy systems in each of the rival states.

Geopolitics, like any conflict, is dramatic:rivals jostle for hegemony on a 3-D chessboard, war threatens, etc. The focus of this drama is on the leaders' calculations and the pieces being moved around the board in the complex battle for hearts, minds, resources and the high ground.

This is the conventional context of history, and so accounts of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire read like contemporary accounts of the rivalry between China and the U.S.: the actors and scenery changes, but the dramatic plot remains the same.

A less dramatic but closer reading of history tells a different story: imperial decline stems not from external rivalries but from internal limitations.Externalities--plague, drought, invasion--are not causes so much as events which reveal the limits of the empire's internal legacy institutions.

These rigidities can be structural--economic or political--or cultural / social.There are two dynamics in play here:

1. Once solutions are institutionalized, they become legacy systems that focus not on flexibly solving problems but on sustaining and defending the interests of the institution and its insiders. The solution becomes the problem.

2. Whatever is viewed as a solution generates unanticipated second-order effects which the system is ill-equipped to resolve.

There are many examples of these dynamics in both China and the U.S., and indeed, in every nation / polity.

Consider the goal of increasing homeownership, a laudable ideal that the U.S. pursued after World War II by institutionalizing the heretofore unavailable innovation of 30-year fixed-rate mortgages and government-agency backed mortgages (Veteran Administration-backed mortgages for veterans, FHA, etc.).

Once the institutions promoting homeownership became self-sustaining legacy systems, they changed from ""solution"" to ""problem.""As homeownership rates reached 65% of American households, the institutional drive to increase homeownership led to the development of subprime mortgages designed for households that did not qualify for conventional mortgages.

To grease the skids, lending standards were stripped to the point of irrelevance,liar loanstook center stage and ratings agencies rubber-stamped risky mortgages as low-risk.

The net result of this institutional self-serving inertia was the collapse of subprime securities and the near-collapse of the global financial systemas the dominoes of default and obscured risk started falling.

Turning to China, consider this chart of what happens when aone child per familystate policy is enforced for three generations:

The policy was institutionalized with a sensible goal of limiting population growth to increase living standards, but without consideration of the second-order effects down the road.

In three generations, there are four grandparents and two parents who are all single children without siblings, uncles or aunts, and a single child who could be tasked not just with caring for two aging parents but four even older grandparents, should they live beyond the ability of their own aging offspring to care for them.

China has acquired the markers of a great power--missions to the moon and Mars, a mighty military and global economic influence--but it lacks a state-funded universal social welfare system that provides a substantial pension and medical care for every retiree regardless of their employment or earnings. This leaves much of the care of China's rapidly aging generations on the shoulders of the third generation of single offspring.

As in other nations, China's birthrate has declined precipitously as the financial pressures on parents mount, especially on young mothers who desire career opportunities equal to those available to young men.

Social welfare programs become increasingly costly and burdensome as populations age. Any state-funded solution will require diverting enormous sums currently spent elsewhere to the care of a large aging cohort.

The sources of brittleness and failure that are overlooked are internal, not external.Parsing geopolitics is fun but our attention is better directed to the limits and second-order effects of legacy systems in each of the rival states.

2024-04-29 23:20:00,Have Fun Staying Poor: Washington Announces $45 Million Subsidy For Low Income Families To Buy EVs,https://web.archive.org/web/20240430120643/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/have-fun-staying-poor-washingtons-inslee-announces-45-million-taxpayer-subsidy-low-income,"Just when you thought you've already witnessed a lifetime's worth of examples of the government being excellent capital allocators with your tax money, one more shining example comes along.

Last week it was reported that Washington Governor Jay Inslee has announced $45 million worth of subsidies that is going to allow ""low income"" families to purchase an electric vehicle.

The initiative offers families the opportunity to receive financial assistance for either leasing or purchasing electric vehicles, with up to $9,000 allocated for leasing and $5,000 for purchasing,accordingto Must Read Alaska.

The program is open to individuals earning 300% or less of the federal poverty level and extends to both new and used EVs. Approximately 9,000 people can benefit from the grant, with the potential for either 9,000 individuals to opt for the $5,000 deal or 5,000 individuals for the $9,000 option.

“Washingtonians really get it when it comes to electric vehicles,” Inslee said at a press conference last week.

Governor Inslee characterized the initiative as a means to ""democratize EVs,"" emphasizing a broader goal of advancing the electrification of transportation. He expressed optimism about widespread adoption, anticipating significant participation and benefit from the program.

However, the program has faced criticism, notably from Washington Policy Center Environmental Director Todd Myers. Myers contends that the subsidies fail to effectively curb carbon emissions and represent a misallocation of taxpayer funds that could be better utilized for other environmental priorities like (we swear we are not making this up) salmon recovery.

Hey Todd, two wrongs don't make a right! But we digress. Despite the controversy, the grant funds are slated to become available to eligible low-income residents in August.

Myers wrote in a blog post:“This is one more example of how wasteful and ineffective Washington’s climate policy is.""

He continued:“It also reveals the disingenuousness of claiming that climate change is an ‘existential crisis’ while wasting tens of millions of dollars on projects that do nothing to address that crisis.”

2024-04-29 23:40:00,Does The CIA Run America?,https://web.archive.org/web/20240430120643/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/does-cia-run-america,"Authored by Jeffrey Tucker via The Epoch Times,

We’ve all surely had dark thoughts that the CIA is really running the United States, including many media venues. Maybe that’s been true for decades and we just didn’t know it.If so, let’s just say that it would explain a tremendous amount of what has otherwise been clouded in secrecy.

How would this be possible? Knowledge is power while secret knowledge is full control. Even fake knowledge means power and control, such as we found out in the phony Russiagate investigation early in Trump’s term. They hounded the new administration for years under a completely fake scenario in which Russia somehow got Donald Trump elected.

Yes, that was an intelligence operation all along, one directly designed to overthrow an election, a “color revolution” on our own soil.

How dare an agency not elected by the people, and evading oversight and public accountability, put itself ahead of the Constitution and the rule of law? It’s been going on for many decades as the agencies have gained ever more power, even to the point of forcing a full lockdown of America and even the world under false pretense.

None of this is verifiable precisely because of the secrecy involved. It’s not as if the intelligence community is going to send out a press release: “Democracy in America is an illusion. We know because we control nearly everything, plus we aspire to control even more.”

The incredulous among us will shoot back: look at what you are saying! Your conspiracy theory is non-falsifiable. The less evidence you have for it, the more you believe it. How in the world can we argue with you? Your position is not really plausible but there is nothing we can do to convince you otherwise.

Let’s grant the point. Still, let’s not dismiss the theory completely. Based on a New York Times (NYT) piece that appeared last week, it contains more than a grain of truth. The article istitled: “Campaign Puts Trump and the Spy Agencies on a Collision Course.”

Quote:“Even as president, Donald J. Trump flaunted his animosity for intelligence officials, portraying them as part of a politicized ‘deep state’ out to get him. And since he left office, that distrust has grown into outright hostility, with potentially serious implications for national security should he be elected again.”

Ok, let’s be clear. If the intelligence community led by the CIA is not the “deep state,” what is?

Further, it is proven many times over that the Deep State is in fact out to get him. This is not even controversial. Indeed, there is no reason for these journalists to write the above as if Donald Trump is somehow consumed by some kind of baseless paranoia.

Let’s keep going here:“Trump is now on a possible collision course with the intelligence community .... The result is a complicated and possibly destabilizing situation the United States has never seen before: deep-seated suspicion and disdain on the part of a former and perhaps future president toward the very people he would be relying on for the most sensitive information he would need to perform his role if elected again.”

Wait just a moment. You are telling us that all previous presidents have had a happy relationship with the CIA? That’s rather interesting to know. And deeply troubling too, since the CIA has been managing regime change the world over for a very long time, and is now directly involved in U.S. politics at the most intimate level.

Any president worth his salt should absolutely have a hostile relationship with such an agency, if only to establish clear civilian control over the government, without which it’s not possible to say that we live in a Constitutional republic.

And now, according to the NYT, we have one seeking the Presidency who does not defer to the agency and that this is destabilizing and deeply problematic. Who does that suggest really rules this country?

Is the NYT itself guilty of the most extreme conspiracy theory imaginable, or is it just stating facts as we know them? I’m going to guess that it is the latter. In this case, every single American should be deeply alarmed.

Crazy huh? As for the phrase “never seen before,” we have to push back. What about George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, James Polk, and Calvin Coolidge? They were all previous presidents, according to the history books that people once read.

There was no CIA back then. If you doubt this, I’m pretty sure that your favorite AI engine will confirm it.

One must suppose that when the NYT says “never seen before,” it means in the post-war period. And that very well might be true. John F. Kennedy defied them. We know that for certain. The mysteries surrounding his murder won’t be solved fully until we get the documents. But the consensus is growing that this murder was really a coup by the CIA, a message sent as a lesson to every successor in that office.

Think of that: we live in a country today where most people readily admit that the CIA probably killed the president. Amazing.

It’s intriguing to know at this late date that the Watergate “scandal” was not what it appeared to be, namely an intrepid media holding government to account. Even astute observers at the time believed the mainstream narrative. Now we have plenty of evidence that this too was nothing but a deep state attack on a president who had lost patience with it and provoked another coup.

All credit to my brilliant father who speculated along these lines at the time. I was very young with only the vaguest clue about what was happening. But I recall very well that he was convinced that Richard Nixon was set up in a trap and unfairly hounded out of office not for the bad things he was doing but for standing up to the Deep State.

If my own father, not a particularly political person, knew this for certain at the time, this must have been a strong perception even then.

You hear the rap that these agencies—the CIA is one but there are many adjacent others—are not allowed by law to intervene in domestic politics. At this point and after so much experience, this comes across to me like something of a joke. We know from vast evidence and personal testimony that the CIA has been manipulating political figures, narratives, and outcomes for a very long time.

How involved is the CIA in journalism today?Well, as a traditionally liberal paper, you might suppose that the NYT itself would be highly skeptical of the CIA. But these days, they have published a long string of aggressively defensive articles with titles like “It Turns Out that the Deep State Is Awesome” and “Government Surveillance Keeps Us Safe.” We can add this last piece to the list.

So let’s just say it: the NYT is CIA. So too is Mother Jones, Rolling Stone, Slate, Salon, and many other mainstream publications, including major tech companies like Google and Microsoft. The tentacles are everywhere and ever more obvious. Operation Mockingbird was just the beginning. The network is everywhere and the practice of manipulating the news is wholly normalized.

Once you start developing the ability to see the markings, you simply cannot unsee them, which is why people who think and write about this can come across as crackpot crazy after a while.

Have you considered that maybe the crackpots are exactly right? If so, shouldn’t we, at bare minimum, seek to support a Presidential candidate with a hostile relationship to the intelligence community?

Indeed, that ought to be a bare minimum standard of qualification. There is simply no way we can restore civilian control of government and constitutional government until this agency can be thoroughly reigned in or abolished completely.

2024-04-30 02:00:00,"""Remarkable Turn Of Events"" - Alleged Chinese Spy Working For AfD MP Was Informant For German Intelligence For Years",https://web.archive.org/web/20240430120643/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/remarkable-turn-events-alleged-chinese-spy-working-afd-mp-was-informant-german#comment-stream,"Authored by John Cody via ReMix News,

The news about Alternative for Germany (AfD) MEP Maximilian Krah’s assistant and his arrest for suspected espionage on behalf of China continues to make national headlines, butas more information comes out, the more German intelligence and the political establishment continue to look worse and worse.

Now, news reports have revealed that Krah’s employee, Chinese-German nationalJian G., worked for the German domestic intelligence service for years before joining the AfD politician.

Krah has since commented on the new bombshell information, writing on X:

“Remarkable turn of events!”

https://twitter.com/KrahMax/status/1783917894159458787

Much is at stake, as Krah is the top candidate for the AfD in the run-up to the EU parliamentary elections in June.The latest report shows that the powerful Office for the Protection of Constitution (BfV) not only recruited Jian G. as a spy, but also dropped him as an informant because there were concerns he was a double agent for China.

However, despite these suspicions, Jian G. gained German citizenship, became a member of the Social Democrats (SPD), and even passed the EU parliament’s security clearance.

Former minister Mathias Brodkorb questioned the story on X,writing:

They are really funny. Let’s assume the story is true:

1. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution is working with the man.

2. Then, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution ends the collaboration because the man could be a double agent.

3. Then the German state naturalizes this agent.

Intermediate question: Where was the Office for the Protection of the Constitution at that time?

4. Then, Krah wants to hire the man as an employee of the EU parliament. That cannot be done without a security check. So the EU parliament should actually have asked the German security authorities whether there was anything against the man. But apparently they didn’t. Otherwise, the man would not have been cleared and could not have been hired.

Intermediate question: Where was the Office for the Protection of the Constitution at that time? And you are now seriously asking what the problem is? Seriously?

One of the main questions is why the Office for the Protection of the Constitution never informed Krah or the AfD about their suspicions, which is standard operating procedure, and one designed to protect the country’s parties from foreign infiltration.Notably, allowing Jian G. to work for Krah created a favorable political scenario for the establishment to later arrest him in order to smear the AfD. Notably, Jian G. was arrested right before EU parliamentary elections.

The question now is whether the BfV purposefully kept the AfD in the dark for years about the information it knew in order to damage the party.

According to Bild newspaper, Jian G. was an informant for the Saxon Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) since 2007 at the earliest. Previously, he had unsuccessfully offered to work for the federal branch of the BfV, but he was rejected, and referred back to the Saxon branch of the BfV.

Jian G. reportedly worked with the intelligence service on his own initiative, including supplying information that dealt with Chinese state actors taking action against Chinese exiles in Germany. Eight years after joining the Saxon BfV as an informant, the Saxon branch was informed by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution that G. could be a double spy.

In 2015 and 2016, G. was then directly observed by the counterintelligence department of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Officers also questioned him about their suspicions but were unable to prove that he was a spy for China. He was therefore listed as a “suspected case” during that period.

In 2018, G. was finally removed as an informant by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.

However, by that time, Jian G. had already made contact with Krah and then went on to work as his employee in the EU parliament beginning in 2019. He was then intensively monitored by the domestic intelligence service from 2020 and finally arrested in April 2024.

As noted above, despite the suspicion of espionage, the Chinese national was granted a German passport, was also a member of the SPD for a time, and was able to pass the security check for the EU parliament.

In addition, the BfV under Thomas Haldenwang (CDU), who is notoriously anti-AfD and publicly working against the party, failed to inform Krah or the AfD about the suspicion of espionage against Jian G.

As Remix News has documented, Haldenwang has made numerous remarks against the AfD, including on state-funded television, all in violation of neutrality. Haldenwang belongs to the CDU party.

Notably, this is standard procedure in such cases, which means the Office for the Protection of the Constitution withheld this information from the AfD in violation of past precedent and procedure.

2024-04-30 02:45:00,Captured NATO Military Equipment Put On Month-Long Display In Moscow,https://web.archive.org/web/20240430120643/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/captured-nato-military-equipment-put-month-long-display-moscow#comment-stream,"Russia will soonshowcase a parade of NATO vehicles captured from the battlefieldin Ukraine. Or rather, we might say that Putin is about to show off his 'trophy vehicles'.

A month-long exhibit displaying the Western military equipment will run starting May 1st at Moscow's Victory Park, and which will be featured alongside the capital's annual Red Square Victory Day Parade on May 9 which commemorates the victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two.

The display will feature an array of armored fighting vehicles, includingan American Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, a Swedish CV90 and a French-made AMX-10RC.

It will also includedestroyed American tanks, perstate media:

For the first time Russian troops have hauled a disabled US-made M1 Abrams tank away from the front line of the Ukraine conflict, the beginning of a journey that will eventually see the vehicle displayed at a trophy show in Moscow, officials have said.

German-made Leopard main battle tanksare also being transferred to the Russian capital to be put on display.

Russia's defense ministry has listed that it additionally has examples of military equipment made in Australia, Austria, France, Finland, Turkey, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden and South Africa - as cited inNewsweek.

Russian media sources have already begun releasing images and footage of the vehicles being staged ahead of the official event kick-off.

According to reports, some of the vehicleswill even display American and British flags, highlighting that they were captured on the frontlines in Ukraine, in what appears to also be a PR effort to embarrass the Western military alliance.

Last year the Russian military released several videos and images of burning French-supplied main battle tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield. At that time Russian officials began to talk of taking""our trophies""- that is, captured and/or destroyed Western equipment that had previously been supplied to Kiev.

Russia's military is busy hauling destroyed M1 Abrams tanks from the battlefield to Moscow:

It appears Moscow is set to especially humiliate the US and UK this year, given both countries just passed huge amounts of extra aid, to be doled out over the coming year.

Throughout well over two years of conflict, Russia says it has destroyed dozens of West-supplied tanks and armored fighting vehicles...

Russia has since warned that as a consequence of Biden and US Congress authorizing $61 billion for Ukraine, its forces will have to push the frontlines back deeper into Ukraine, in order to make it harder for enemy missiles to reach inside Russian territory.

2024-04-30 04:15:00,Russia Installs 'Cope Cages' On Oil Refineries As Ukraine Ramps Up Kamikaze Drone Attacks,https://web.archive.org/web/20240430120643/https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/russia-installs-cope-cages-oil-refineries-ukraine-ramps-kamikaze-drone-attacks,"A sudden surge in Ukrainian drone strikes targeting Russia's vast energy industry materialized early last week (read here) and continued into the weekend (read here). To combat drone strikes on refineries and crude and or crude product storage tanks, ""cope cages"" have been installed to fortify at least one refinery against potential aerial threats.

The proliferation of drones on the modern battlefield in Eastern Europe, more specifically in Ukraine, has been absolutely stunning to spectate over the last two years. From suicide drones taking out infantry troops on the first and second lines to Ukraine launching drone swarm attacks on Russia's energy complex, warfare is forever changing.

With that being said, military forces and even countries must adapt to this changing environment where drones and AI dominate the battlefield. And that's why Russia is now installing anti-drone cages, known as ""cope cages,"" to protect these critical facilities that help fund Moscow's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

According toEurAsian Times:

The latest development involves the installation of what is commonly referred to as a “cope cage” on a Russian oil facility, likely to fortify it against potential aerial threats.

An image circulating on the internet on April 27 depicted Russian oil depots equipped with these anti-drone cages.

Although specific details regarding the location of the fortified depot remain undisclosed, speculations suggest it might be under the ownership of the Slavyansk ECO Group, based on the logo painted on the oil depot.

X userSpecial Kherson Cathas posted an image of a Russian oil tank farm with anti-drone cages.

The X user also posted several other images of Russian military machines with anti-drone cages.

2024-04-30 05:00:00,"Over 1,000 Protestors Demand Establishment Of Islamic State In Germany",https://web.archive.org/web/20240430120643/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/over-1000-protestors-demand-establishment-islamic-state-germany,"Authored by Stephen Katte via The Epoch Times(emphasis ours),

Over 1,000 peaceful protesters gathered in Hamburg, Germany, over the weekend, with the leader of the group demanding the establishment of am Islamic caliphate in the European country.

A caliphate is a political-religious form of government under the leadership of an Islamic steward with the title of the caliph or “successor of the prophet of God,” who is considered a high-ranking leader in the Muslim world.

According to local German media reports and German authorities, the protest was organized by a young man who leads a populist extremist group, Muslim Interaktiv.In several videos of the protest posted online, a speaker addressing a crowd can be heard describing the caliphate as a “system that provides security” that has been “demonized” by politicians and media in Germany.The crowd responded with cheer, and some with chants of “Allahu Akbar (God is the greatest).”

A social media account connected to the group shared multiple photos and posts of the protest, which it says was aimed at standing against the “demonization of all Islamic life in Germany.”

The organizers claim the rally was to protest against alleged Islamophobic policies of the German government and alleged media disinformation campaigns against Muslims in Germany while reporting on the unfolding Israel-Hamas war.

“We will raise our voices together, inshallah (if God wills it),” a post on X said. “Together against Islamophobic reporting, both in recent weeks and in recent months.”

Germany’s Federal Criminal Intelligence Service, or BKA, and Hamburg’s security services claim Muslim Interaktiv is part of Hizb ut-Tahrir (‘Party of Liberation’), a global Salafi Islamist movement with the goal of uniting the world under an Islamic caliphate and implementing Sharia law.

Hizb ut-Tahrir, which was founded in Jerusalem in 1953, has been banned from operating in Germany since 2003. It is alsobannedin many Muslim-majority countries and faces resistance from the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, where it advocates for the re-establishment of a caliphate through non-military means, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations.

The United Kingdombannedthe group in January under its counterterrorism laws despite the group’s insistence it is a non-violent political party. Extremism analyst Ghaffar Hussain disagreed with the designation. But he warneda forum in Januarythat, while he does not believe Hizb ut-Tahrir is a terrorist group as its ideology does not directly rally members to commit acts of violence, the ideology does spread violent and anti-Semitic rhetoric, and justifies and encourages violence and terrorism from other Islamist groups.

In his designation,UK Home Affairs Secretary James Cleverlycitedrisks of inciting violence and antisemitism during ceasefire protests for Gaza.The order designating them a terrorist organization makes belonging to Hizb ut-Tahrir or inviting support for the group a criminal offense. Offenders can be hit with potential prison sentence time or a fine.

At the moment, there has been no suggestion that the Muslim Interaktiv’s demonstration in Germany broke the law, despite the Muslim Interaktiv group being classified by the intelligence services as extremist. In October 2023, shortly after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel and killed 1,200 people, Muslim Interaktiv held a similar protest that ended in clashes with police.

German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser of the left-wing Social Democratic Party said during an interview with local German media that police need to act if crimes are committed during political demonstrations.

“Seeing an Islamist demonstration of this kind on our streets is difficult to bear. It’s a good thing that the Hamburg police counteracted crime with a large presence,” she said.

“The red line at which Germany’s protection of the right of assembly and freedom of speech ended had to be clear. No terrorism propaganda for Hamas, no hate speech directed at Jews. If crimes like this occur, there has to be immediate and forceful intervention at demonstrations.”

Muslim Interaktiv followers are classed as “pop-Islamists,” and the increasing reach and influence among young people have been labeled as a concern by German authorities. According to Ms. Faeser, the group is being watched.

“Other groups that raise emotions, radicalize and recruit new Islamists are also being watched by our security authorities. This included the group at the Hamburg demonstration,” she said.

2024-04-30 05:45:00,$3.5 Billion Slipped Into Ukraine-Israel Aid Bill To 'Supercharge Mass Migration From The Middle East',https://web.archive.org/web/20240430120643/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/35-billion-slipped-ukraine-israel-aid-bill-supercharge-mass-migration-middle-east,"Tucked away in the $95 billion military aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwanis a $3.5 billion slush fund to open new processing centers for Muslim migrants, in what Sen. Eric Schmitt described as a bid to ""supercharge mass migration from the Middle East.""

Not only did the “Foreign Aid” package do nothing to secure our own border it included $3.5 Billion to supercharge mass migration from the Middle East.https://t.co/bsbYapsaE2

And asBreitbartpoints out, the $95 billion package doesnotinclude any funds to help rebuild America's border defenses against illegal migration - but itdoescontain $481 million to settle migrants in US cities, and of course, the $3.5 billion to expand migration programs worldwide.

The$3.5 billionwas granted to the Department of State,which works with many international groups that feed and transport migrants on their way to the United States.

Biden’s deputies are now using the refugee programs as an adjunct to their diversity-expanding “equity” migration policy. For example, Biden’s deputies used the program in March to import3,009 migrantsfrom the safe and democratic countries of El Salvador and Guatemala.

They are also using the refugee funds to expand migration routes from many African and Muslim countries.In March, they pulled in 12,018 people fromthe Congo, plus 16,732 migrants from the Muslim countries of Afghanistan, Syria, Pakistan, Iraq, and Eritrea, according to a report byStacker.com. -Breitbart

Tucked into the folds of the new foreign aid package is $3.5 billion for mass immigration NGOs.America Last Republicans voted to supercharge mass immigration while approving ZERO $$ for the U.S. border.

According to anApril 23 releasefrom the Biden DHS visa-granting agency, ""The Biden-Harris administration set the refugee admissions ceiling for fiscal year 2024 at 125,000 refugees,"" adding ""With the opening of the Doha Field Office on May 7, 2024,and the Ankara Field Office on May 9, 2024, USCIS will have 11 international field offices. Other international field offices include Beijing; Guangzhou, China; Guatemala City; Havana; Mexico City; Nairobi, Kenya; New Delhi; San Salvador, El Salvador; and Tegucigalpa, Honduras.""

So - we have the US government encouraging migration, both legal and illegal - whichhurts low-income Americans the most, while neglecting to the borders. Seems we've learned nothing from Europe.

2024-04-30 06:30:00,How EU Law Has Made The Internet Less Free For Everyone Else,https://web.archive.org/web/20240430120643/https://www.zerohedge.com/political/how-eu-law-has-made-internet-less-free-everyone-else#comment-stream,"Authored by Mustafa Ekin Turan via The Mises Institute,

If you have been using the internet for longer than a couple of years, you might have noticed that it used to be much “freer.”

What freer means in this context is that there was less censorship and less stringent rules regarding copyright violations on social media websites such as YouTube and Facebook (and consequently a wider array of content), search engines used to often show results from smaller websites, there were less “fact-checkers,” and there were (for better or for worse) less stringent guidelines for acceptable conduct. In the last ten years, the internet’s structure and environment have undergone radical changes. This has happened in many areas of the internet; however, this article will specifically focus on the changes in social media websites and search engines.

This article will argue that changes in European Union regulations regarding online platforms played an important role in shaping the structure of the internet to the way it is today and that further changes in EU policy that will be even more detrimental to freedom on the internet may be on the horizon.

Now that readers have an idea of what “change” is referring to, we should explain in detail which EU regulations played a part in bringing it about. The first important piece ofregulationwe will deal with is theDirective on Copyright in the Digital Single Market that came out in 2019.Article 17 of this directive states that online content-sharing service platforms are liable for the copyrighted content that is posted on their websites if they do not have a license for said content. To be exempt from liability, the websites must show that they exerted their best efforts to ensure that copyrighted content does not get posted on their sites, cooperated expeditiously to take the content down if posted, and took measures to make sure the content does not get uploaded again.If these websites were ever in a place to be liable for even a significant minority of the content uploaded to them, the financial ramifications would be immense.

Due to this regulation, around the same period, YouTube and many other sites strengthened their policy regardingcopyrighted content, and ever since then—sometimes rightfully, sometimes wrongfully—content creatorshave been complaining about their videos getting flagged for copyright violations.

Another EU regulation that is of note for our topic is theDigital Services Actthat came out in 2023.The Digital Services Act is a regulation that defines very large online platforms and search engines as platform sites with more than forty-five million active monthly users and places specific burdens on these sites along with the regulatory burden that is eligible for all online platforms. The entirety of this act is too long to be discussed in this article; however, some of the most noteworthy points are as follows:

The EU Commission (the executive body of the EU) will work directly with very large online platforms to ensure that their terms of service are compatible withrequirementsregarding hate speech and disinformation as well as the additional requirements of the Digital Services Act. The EU Commission also has the power to directly influence the terms of conduct of these websites.

Very large online platforms and search engines have the obligation to ban and preemptively fight against and alter their recommendation systems to discriminate against many different types of content ranging from hate speech and discrimination to anything that might be deemed misinformation and disinformation.

These points should be concerning to anyone who uses the internet.The vagueness of terms such as “hate speech” and “disinformation” allows the EU to influence the recommendation algorithms and terms of service of these websites and to keep any content that goes against their “ideals” away from the spotlight or away from these websites entirely.

Even if the issues that are discussed here were entirely theoretical, it would still be prudent to be concerned about a centralized supragovernmental institution such as the EU having this much power regarding the internet and the websites we use every day. However, as with thebanningof Russia Today from YouTube, which was due to allegations of disinformation and happened around the same time the EU placed sanctions on Russia Today, we can see that political considerations can and do lead to content being banned on these sites.We currently live in a world with an almost-infinite amount of information; due to this, it would be impossible for anyone or even any institution to sift through all the data surrounding any issue and to come up with a definitive “truth” on the subject, and this is assuming that said persons or institution is unbiased on the issue and approaching it in good faith, which is rarely the case.

All of us have ways of viewing the world that filter our understanding of issues even when we have the best intentions, not to mention the fact thatsupranational bodies such as the EU and the EU Commission have vested political incentives and are influenced by many lobbies, which may render their decisions regarding what is the “truth” and what is “disinformation” to be faulty at best and deliberately harmful at worst.All of this is to say that in general, none of us—not even the so-called experts—can claim to know everything regarding an issue enough to make a definitive statement as to what is true and what is disinformation, and this makes giving a centralized institution the power to constitute what the truth is a very dangerous thing.

The proponents of these EU regulationsarguethat bad-faith actors may use disinformation to deceive the public.There is obviously some truth in this; however, one could also argue that many different actors creating and arguing their own narrative with regard to what is happening around the world are preferable to a centralized institution controlling a unified narrative of what is to be considered the “truth.”

In my scenario,even if some people are “fooled”(even though to accurately consider people to be fooled, we would have to claim that we know the definitive truth regarding a multifaceted complex issue that can be viewed from many angles),the public will get to hear many narratives about what happened and can make up their own minds.

If this leads to people being fooled by bad-faith actors, it will never be the entirety of the population. Some people will be “fooled” by narrative A, some by narrative B, some by narrative C, and so forth. However, in the current case, if the EU is or ever becomes the bad-faith actor who uses its power to champion its own narrative for political purposes, it has the power to control and influence what the entirety of the public hears and believes with regard to an issue, and that is a much more dangerous scenario than the one that would occur if we simply let the so-called wars of information be waged.The concentration of power is something that we should always be concerned about, especially when it comes to power regarding information since information shapes what people believe, and what people believe changes everything.

Another important thing to note is that just because it is the EU that makes these regulations does not change the fact that it affects everyone in the world. After all, even if someone posts a video on YouTube from the United States or from Turkey, it will still face the same terms of service. Almost everyone in the world uses Google or Bing, and the EU has power over the recommendation algorithms of these search engines.This means that the EU has the power over what information most people see when they want to learn something from the internet. No centralized institution can be trusted with this much power.

One final issue of importance is the fact that the EU is investing in new technologies such as artificial intelligence programs to “tackle disinformation” and to check the veracity of content posted online. An important example of this is theInVID project,which is in its own words“a knowledge verification platform to detect emerging stories and assess the reliability of newsworthy video files and content spread via social media.”

If you are at all worried about the state of the internet as explained in this article, know that this potential development may lead to the EU doing all of the things described here in an even more “effective” manner in the future.

2024-04-30 06:55:00,Big Government's Crackdown On Hedge Fund Home-Buying Looms,https://web.archive.org/web/20240430120643/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/big-govts-crackdown-hedge-fund-home-buying-looms#comment-stream,"""I strongly support free markets,"" but this ""corporate large-scale buying of residential homes seems to be distorting the market and making it harder for the average Texan to purchase a home,"" Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wrote on X in March. He added, ""This must be added to the legislative agenda to protect Texas families.""

I strongly support free markets.But this corporate large-scale buying of residential homes seems to be distorting the market and making it harder for the average Texan to purchase a home.This must be added to the legislative agenda to protect Texas families.https://t.co/VBs6Rluh3K

Institutional ownership of single-family homes has surged in recent years, with many firms turning the bulk of these homes into rentals. This has triggered a massive uproar with some lawmakers who want to end Wall Street's home-buying mania.

The Wall Street Journalreports that several lawmakers in Nebraska, California, New York, Minnesota, and North Carolina have sponsored bills requiring large single-family hedge fund owners to dispose of their portfolios or risk hefty fines.

The bill mentioned the most in the corporate press, called the End Hedge Fund Control of American Homes Act, was introduced in the Senate by Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley with companion legislation introduced in the House by Rep. Adam Smith.

The Merkley/Smith bill could force hedge funds to divest their single-family home portfolios over the course of ten years.

Lawmakers argue that ""investors that have scooped up hundreds of thousands of houses to rent out are contributing to the dearth of homes for sale and driving up home prices,"" according to WSJ, noting that limited housing supply has made housing unaffordable for the vast majority of Americans.

Data from John Burns Research and Consulting shows that the share of institutional buying of single-family homes topped 25% in the first quarter—near a record high. The data goes back to 1Q16.

Calls to block hedge funds from buying single-family homes predominantly come from Democrats, but some conservatives, such as Texas Gov. Abbott, also show support.

In an election year, blocking hedge funds from buying single-family homes might be popular with middle-class and working-poor voters battered by the era of high inflation under failed Bidenomics. Many have been financially paralyzed in today's economy, unable to afford a home, and stuck in a doom loop of renting and no savings with maxed-out credit cards.

However, institutional investors have a different view of the bills being proposed by lawmakers. They're overwhelmingly frustrated with signs that the government could step into a free market and break something.

During a recent interview on Fox Business, Kevin O'Leary shared his stance on the proposed legislation.

""Very bad idea. Very bad policy when you try to manipulate markets or sources of capital,"" O'Leary said, adding, ""I don't care if they're Democrats or Republicans, whoever they are, stay out of the markets. Let the markets be the markets.""

The real problem isn't the hedge funds but the Federal Reserve, which has distorted markets with record-low rates over the years. Great job, Yellen/Powell.

Stagflation is back in the economy, as last week’s GDP and PCE figures reveal.The USGDP growth metric for Q1 was only 1.6%, much lower than expected. To make matters worse, the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures)price index came in hotter than expected, staying steady at 2.8%.

Peter has been predicting stagflation for a while, and now that it’s here, he sees mining stocks as an opportunity:

“That’s one of the reasons I’m so over-weighted in mining stocks, apart from the valuation, isif there is stagflation, you don’t have a better economic environment. Because you have inflation that the Fed can’t fight, because you have a weak economy.So the Fed is reluctant to raise rates, because it’ll weaken the economy further. … Plus, the weak economy widens the budget deficits. And that means a weaker dollar, more money printing, more inflation. Sothe best possible economic scenario for gold stocks is stagflation, which of course is the worst economic scenario for the economy.”

High consumer spending is especially alarming, considering these figures are probably conservative and underestimate the true extent of inflation in the economy:

“Why are people spending more? Well, because things cost more. That’s why they’re spending more. They’re not buying more.And even though these numbers are supposed to be adjusted for inflation, they’re not because you know the government numbers don’t accurately capture how much inflation there actually is.”

The savings rate also dipped from last month, dropping from 3.6% to 3.2%. Saving is a great economic indicator, as Peter explains:

“​​This is the lowest savings rate I think in a couple of years. So this is not good news— that Americans are having to deplete their savings.This is bad news. When the economy is good, you save more. That’s when you add to your rainy day fund. You have to tap into it when times are tough and you’re struggling. Andthat’s exactly what Americans are doing. They’re struggling, and they’re tapping into their savings in order to do it.”

Instead of addressing the Fed’s disastrous monetary policy, the Biden administration is trying to raise taxes on wealthy Americans, which means raising taxes on everyone eventually:

“They’re promising just to tax the rich, right? The millionaires and billionaires. Of course, that’s what they always say.That’s what they said in 1916 when they got the income tax or 16th amendment. It was just to tax Carnegie, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt. They were going to lower taxes on the middle class, right? If we just allow this 4% tiny little tax, that was the maximum bracket. …Next thing you knew that 4% rate was like 70, 80%. And then by the Second World War, they had the withholding tax and pretty much everybody was paying the income tax.”

Peter addressesrecent proposals for wealth taxes on the ultra-wealthy, pointing out how they’re both illegal and counterproductive:

“It would bevery destructive to the economy, to wealth creation, to production, to employment.So it would be a complete economic disaster as well as being unconstitutional. So I mean, the good news is these are just talking points for the election. So it’s not going to actually happen.Now, it might happen if Biden won the election and the Democrats got the House and the Senate. Then it actually might happen.But as of now, it just shows you where they stand, and they’re throwing red meat to their base, which is basically socialist.”

At the end of this episode, Peter updates us on his FOIA request for the closing of his bank in Puerto Rico. After the government essentially refused to disclose all relevant information for his case, Peter explains how corrupt and shady this whole affair is:

“I have a right to see this information, but they don’t want me to see it. I think because it reveals the commission of a crime.And so, you know, the IRS can commit a crime and then they can cover it up. Because they’re the government, right? They prosecute the citizens for committing crimes, but then they get away with murder.They commit crimes all they want because they’re the cops, right? And they make the rules.”

Be sure to check outPeter’s recent interview with Anthony Crudele, in which they discuss the traditional value of gold, Bitcoin’s role in the economy, and the perpetual inflation that defines today’s economy.

2024-04-30 07:45:00,HSBC CEO Unexpectedly Steps Down For 'Work-Life Balance',https://web.archive.org/web/20240430120643/https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/hsbc-ceo-unexpectedly-steps-down-work-life-balance,"HSBC Holdings Plc unexpectedly announced Tuesday that Chief Executive Noel Quinn is resigning after five years, citing the need for a 'better work-life balance.'

The Asia-focused bank plans to complete the succession process in the second half of the year.Reuterssaid the top candidate for the position (at the moment) is Chief Financial Officer Georges Elhedery.

Quinn, 62, has been at the helm for five years. Under his leadership, the bank's profits soared, and its share price increased after the size of its underperforming units was slashed, especially in the United States and Europe. The bank has focused its efforts on Asia.

Throughout his tenure, shares of HSBC have risen nearly 50% in Hong Kong.

Quinn told reporters on a call that his departure is entirely based on pursuing a better work-life balance, or at least that's the public understanding.

""Doing this job, you have to give 100% — if not 120% — of your energy, your mindset, your time to the role,"" he said, adding, ""You can keep doing that, but that doesn't necessarily achieve the balance in life that I wanted.""

""I've held intensive leadership roles since I took on a commercial bank role in October 2008 so I'm personally ready for a change,"" he continued.

And he concluded:  ""It's also a natural inflection point for the bank, as it comes to the end of the current transformation phase. It's an ideal time to bring in leadership to move the bank forward over the next five years.""

Will Howlett, a financial analyst at Quilter Cheviot, who was quoted by Bloomberg, said the CEO's exit is a major ""surprise, especially given Quinn's short tenure during which he has led the bank through significant changes.""

Cheviot said, ""The departure of Quinn introduces an element of uncertainty about the bank's future leadership at a time when HSBC is navigating a complex global financial landscape.""

Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, pointed out that Quinn has ""navigated geopolitical tensions between the US and China"" over the course of his tenure and also cites ""uncertainty"" on who will lead the bank from here.

Other analysts hope the next CEO will introduce further plans to maintain the bank's focus on its businesses in Asian countries.

Let's not forget that HSBC has been involved in US money laundering probes. In 2012, the bank agreed to pay $1.92 billion to settle one of these investigations.
